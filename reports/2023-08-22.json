Ebb’s technology uses electrochemistry to split saltwater into its acidic and alkaline parts. The long-term plan is to return alkalinity to the ocean, creating chemical reactions that pull CO2 from the air and store it safely in the sea.\n\n\n“We’re essentially accelerating a natural process,” Ben Tarbell, CEO and co-founder of Ebb Carbon, told Canary Media. ​“So instead of taking millions of years [to happen], it takes weeks to months.”\n\n\n\nSubscribe to receive Canary's latest news\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the two-year-old startup unveiled its first-of-a-kind demonstration project, which is designed to remove 100 metric tons of CO2 per year at full capacity. Along with PNNL, Ebb is partnering with research institutions such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Washington to better predict how its system could work at scale — and how it could potentially affect ocean ecosystems.\n\n\nOcean-based approaches are gaining traction within the burgeoning field of carbon dioxide removal, a process that’s considered ​“[unavoidable](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/carbon-removal-now-unavoidable-part-of-fighting-climate-change-un-says)” in fighting climate change. While countries must prioritize phasing out fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, those steps aren’t likely to be enough to avoid the worst effects of a warming planet, according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n\nSolutions for removing CO2 — including using [giant air filters](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/a-buzzy-new-carbon-removal-plant-is-catching-and-releasing-co2), [injecting ​“bio-oil” underground](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/inside-charm-industrials-multimillion-dollar-bid-to-remove-co2-with-plants) and [transforming mining waste](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/meet-a-startup-that-plans-to-use-mining-waste-to-capture-carbon-dioxide) — are all relatively nascent, and they all face significant scientific and technical barriers to scaling up. Even so, government agencies and private investors are plowing funding into these fledgling technologies in the hopes of making it easier and cheaper to draw down planet-warming carbon.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Two tubes labeled \"raw seawater\" and a tube labeled \"filtered seawater\" run from a calm bay onto land.]()\nSeawater flows into PNNL's facility from the tranquil Sequim Bay. (Ebb Carbon)\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the Department of Energy [awarded](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/us-announces-first-winners-in-3-5b-carbon-removal-program) a total of $1.1 billion to two ​“direct air capture” hubs along the U.S. Gulf Coast, with two more hubs slated to be announced next year. The agency also [said it plans](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/notice-intent-issue-funding-opportunity-carbon-negative-shot-pilots) to offer funding to a variety of carbon-removal pilot projects, including five ocean-based systems. The program’s overarching goal is to enable ​“gigaton scales” of CO2 removal and storage by 2050, up from perhaps thousands of tons today.\n\n\nFor new outfits like Ebb, supersizing their projects isn’t the only challenge. Companies and researchers are still figuring out how to accurately quantify and verify just how much CO2 they’re locking away, and for how long. That information is key to knowing whether projects will ultimately benefit the climate — especially if businesses plan on selling carbon-removal ​“credits” or ​“offsets” to other entities.\n\n\n“The momentum is really just getting going around using the ocean as a climate solution,” said Christian Meinig, who leads the coastal sciences division at PNNL. ​“These are still early days, and we’re really going to learn a lot in these coming years.”\n\n\n**Harnessing the ocean to lock away CO2**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nOcean-based carbon removal strategies typically fall into [one of two categories](https://www.wri.org/insights/ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal).\n\n\n“Biotic” approaches rely on photosynthetic organisms to soak up carbon from the atmosphere and store it as biomass. For example, the Israeli companies [Rewind](https://www.rewind.earth/) and [BlueGreen Water Technologies](https://bluegreenwatertech.com/) are taking discarded plant matter and harmful algal blooms, respectively, and [sinking them](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/can-we-fight-climate-change-by-sinking-carbon-into-the-sea) to the bottom of the sea. [Ocean fertilization](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/complicated-role-iron-ocean-health-and-climate-change-180973893/), a theoretical and controversial idea, calls for sprinkling nutrients like iron over seawater to grow CO2-absorbing phytoplankton.\n\n\nThe second category, ​“abiotic” approaches, involves harnessing the seawater itself. [Artificial upwelling](https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/removing-carbon-dioxide-through-artificial-upwelling-and-downwelling-legal-challenges-and) refers to pumping nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean to the surface so it can absorb carbon, a process that would naturally happen over longer periods of time. Electrochemical techniques aim to use electricity to either enhance seawater’s ability to store carbon — or to directly extract CO2 from the ocean.\n\n\n[Equatic](https://www.equatic.tech/), a spinout of UCLA’s Institute for Carbon Management, is working on that last approach.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![A blue box with wires and tubes sits near the waterfront.]()\nEquatic's pilot reactor pumps in seawater at the Port of Los Angeles, California. (Equatic)\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the startup began operating pilot-scale plants in Los Angeles and Singapore, each of which can not only remove 100 kilograms of CO2 per day from seawater — they can also produce smaller amounts of hydrogen. The company plans to trap the extracted CO2 into calcium carbonate, which can be used in low-carbon building materials, and sell the hydrogen to industrial facilities, or use it to power their own process.  \n\n\n\nEquatic’s closed-system design enables it to track and monitor carbon ​“so that we know exactly what is happening before anything leaves the plant,” said Edward Sanders, the startup’s chief operating officer. ​“That’s quite a different approach” from other ocean-focused efforts, he added.\n\n\nEbb Carbon, meanwhile, is ramping up testing on its new demonstration project.\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Startup Ebb Carbon is operating a ​“marine carbon dioxide removal” system at a facility run by the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Pipelines could burst. Storage sites might leak. Fossil fuel power plants might linger, their life span extended by a technology that captures carbon dioxide but not smog and soot.\n\n\nBut the Biden administration has repeatedly linked carbon capture and storage with environmental justice. It has gone as far as to count some CCS spending toward its Justice40 initiative to invest in disadvantaged communities — against the express wishes of its own hand-picked advisory panel on environmental justice.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n“The vibe that we’ve been getting now for a while is like, this is happening. It’s happening whether you like it or not,” said Irene Burga Márquez, climate justice and clean air program director for GreenLatinos. “Which is not a great starting point. It feels like there’s no room for discussion or flexibility. It’s more like, we’re forcing something down your throat with, like, some sugar.”\n\n\nMinority and poor communities have suffered the brunt of fossil fuel pollution for decades. Now, amid a historic effort to tackle climate change, environmental justice advocates say the government is rushing to embrace solutions that give polluters a lifeline — and draw out the suffering of long-burdened communities.\n\n\nThe Biden administration has gone all-in on carbon capture and removal, known collectively as industrial carbon management. President Joe Biden has offered lucrative incentives and demonstration money for the technology through signature bills, and EPA has used carbon capture as the linchpin of its climate rule to cut pollution from power plants.\n\n\nScience backs up the strategy.\n\n\nThe world’s top researchers say countries will have to [extract massive amounts of carbon dioxide](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2022/04/5-takeaways-from-u-n-report-on-how-world-can-still-stop-climate-change-00022776) from the atmosphere in order to prevent catastrophic warming.\n\n\nThe U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found that carbon capture and storage — in which CO2 is captured from the smokestack of a factory or power plant and buried underground permanently — will also be needed to meet global emissions goals. It’s effectively the only way to make deep cuts in emissions from some sectors, like steelmaking. And, the panel says, CCS may be needed to manage carbon from power derived from fossil fuels — which are projected to stay dominant globally until midcentury.\n\n\nBut some environmentalists and advocates for fence-line communities fear that both technologies — direct air capture and carbon capture — could prop up a fossil fuel industry that has burdened marginalized areas for decades.\n\n\nSome [oil companies](https://www.eenews.net/articles/oil-companies-want-to-remove-carbon-from-the-air-using-taxpayer-dollars/) have also been quick to take advantage of federal incentives to suck carbon out of the air, with one oil executive describing direct air capture as a way to “preserve our industry.”\n\n\n“I think the administration in many ways has really bought into the industry pressure to allow fossil fuel industries to continue to thrive during this transition period,” said Ana Baptista, an associate professor in environmental policy at the New School and member of the Equitable and Just Climate Platform.\n\n\n#### ‘Insult to injury’\n\n\nBiden came into office promising to right the environmental wrongs of the past, casting his administration’s action on climate change as lifting up the minority and poor communities impacted by generations of pollution and neglect.\n\n\nOne of his [first executive orders](https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/white-house-environmental-justice-advisory-council) was to form a panel of outside experts to advise the White House on policies that might impact those communities.\n\n\nBut his administration hasn’t always heeded its advice.\n\n\n![An elementary school in Reserve, La., sits next to an industrial elastomer plant.](https://static.politico.com/9e/0e/5b6d9c9d474d9a1886087d8a89e8/civil-rights-enforcement-environment-64941.jpg \"An elementary school in Reserve, La., sits next to an industrial elastomer plant.\")An elementary school in Reserve, La., sits next to an industrial elastomer plant. The Biden administration is at odds with some environmental justice leaders over capturing carbon pollution. | Gerald Herbert/AP Photo\nThe White House Environmental Justice Advisory Panel asked the administration [not to count](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/documents/whiteh2.pdf) the Department of Energy’s carbon capture and carbon removal programs toward the Justice40 initiative. The signature commitment from Biden directs 40 percent of the benefit of climate and energy investment to underserved communities.\n\n\nCounting those programs toward the Justice40 goal, the panel said, would cut into potential investments in more promising areas like renewable energy.\n\n\nThat was two years ago. The White House has not responded to those recommendations — and DOE ended up counting numerous [carbon management demonstration programs](https://www.energy.gov/diversity/doe-justice40-covered-programs) toward the Justice40 goal.\n\n\nDOE did not answer a question from E&E News about whether it might revisit that decision. But the department pointed to its [community benefits plan framework](https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/about-community-benefits-plans#:~:text=Community%20Benefits%20Plans%20are%20based,accessibility%3B%20and%20implementing%20Justice%2040.), which encourages carbon management developers applying for federal funding to outline employment and equity benefits in host communities. Those benefits become contractual obligations if the project is awarded funding.\n\n\nSuch plans “are the best strategy available to the department to ensure that communities are meaningfully engaged in the design and eventual construction of carbon management projects,” DOE said in a statement to E&E News.\n\n\nThe White House has also gone out of its way to ensure some direct air capture facilities are built in disadvantaged areas — despite opposition to them. The administration secured language in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law specifying that two of DOE’s direct air capture hubs would be located in “economically distressed communities” that depend on fossil fuels.\n\n\nEnvironmental justice leaders fear the hubs will end up in minority communities in places like the Louisiana coastline, which they say has long been treated as a petroleum industry sacrifice zone.\n\n\n“It’s sort of like adding insult to injury,” Baptista said. “It’s like, here’s this law that was meant to benefit you with solar panels and green jobs. And instead, you get industrial air capture facilities that pollute your local air. But don’t worry! They might reduce CO2 globally.”\n\n\nEnvironmental justice advocates have also voiced concerns about the risks of transporting captured carbon dioxide through thousands of miles of pipeline and injecting it deep underground.\n\n\nThey point to a February 2020 pipeline rupture that sent residents of a small Mississippi town to the hospital.\n\n\nBut technology experts say the rupture was due to a landslide. A substantial network of CO2 pipelines has existed in the U.S. for the past 50 years, they say, and it has a better safety track record than natural gas pipelines.\n\n\nSusan Hovorka, senior research scientist for the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas, Austin, said it was a “serious mistake” to keep carbon capture out of communities that have suffered because of fossil fuels.\n\n\n“CCS is not heavy industry, and it is not oil and gas,” she said. “It’s a cleanup operation. So I don’t know why you’re protecting people from a cleanup operation.”\n\n\n#### A fateful retreat\n\n\nIn early June, more than a dozen environmental justice advocates gathered with Biden administration officials and advocates of carbon removal at the Wingspread Retreat in Wisconsin, on the western shore of Lake Michigan.\n\n\nThe symposium was held under the Chatham House Rule, in which participants agree not to share specifics of the discussion with those outside the meeting or quote other participants by name. The reason advocates attended, participants said, was a realization that the U.S. was going all-in on carbon capture and carbon removal, with or without the support of the environmental justice community.\n\n\nThree prominent environmental justice groups — the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, WE ACT for Environmental Justice and GreenLatinos — were billed as the symposium’s lead conveners with American University’s Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy and the New York Community Trust.\n\n\nBut it’s unclear how involved the environmental justice groups were in organizing it. Márquez of GreenLatinos said her group contributed little to the meeting’s agenda, which she said seemed to be planned primarily by American University. Monique Harden, director of law and policy at the New Orleans-based Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, said one of the symposium’s objectives appeared to be to persuade environmental justice groups to be more accepting of industrial carbon management.\n\n\nSimon Nicholson, who co-directs the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy, said in an email to E&E News that the goal of the meeting was to provide “a useful and open dialogue amongst leaders to better equip disadvantaged and racialized communities to respond to carbon management questions.”\n\n\nAnother objective, he said: to highlight “key environmental justice considerations and perspectives that can directly inform U.S. federal government decision-making in the spirit of meaningful engagement.”\n\n\n![A sign opposing proposed carbon-capture pipelines is seen in Iowa Falls, Iowa.](https://static.politico.com/ce/b6/2be7d0ef405fbd37e1f30d9ff036/iowa-farmers-oppose-carbon-capture-pipelines-69231.jpg \"A sign opposing proposed carbon-capture pipelines is seen in Iowa Falls, Iowa.\")A sign opposing proposed carbon-capture pipelines is seen in Iowa Falls, Iowa. | Francis Chung/E&E News\nThe event was held at a mansion designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the 1930s for a cleaning products magnate. It was originally planned for May 2022, but many environmental justice advocates declined to attend when they discovered the guest list would include nonprofits, trade groups and academics who work in carbon management.\n\n\nPeggy Shepard of WE ACT and José Bravo of the Just Transition Alliance, who were two of the organizers of the 2022 meeting, didn’t respond to inquiries for this story.\n\n\nOther participants who were granted anonymity to discuss private conversations were concerned that sitting down with carbon management supporters would dilute their message that such technologies are “false solutions” to the climate crisis.\n\n\nBut the policy landscape has shifted dramatically since then. Congress enacted a $369 billion climate spending package in August 2022 that expanded incentives for carbon capture and removal. The Energy Department has moved closer to doling out funds for CCS and is expected to announce grant winners for direct air capture demonstration projects this week.\n\n\nAnd, in May, [EPA announced](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2023/05/11/epa-clamps-down-on-power-plants-00094419) it would draft a long-awaited rule limiting power sector pollution. It designed the proposal around using CCS or hydrogen at power plants.\n\n\nEPA’s choice of carbon capture and hydrogen was a nod to legal constraints imposed by a conservative Supreme Court. Its regulatory documents — and analyses by national green groups — argue that most coal-fired power plants will likely shut down rather than undergo costly retrofits. The reliance on CCS and hydrogen, they say, allows EPA to demand deeper emissions cuts without tempting a rebuke by the courts.\n\n\nBut advocates for fence-line communities say the rule could drive a rapid build-out of CO2 pipelines, carbon capture facilities and underground carbon storage instead of a green energy transition.\n\n\nIf the meeting’s goal was to persuade environmental justice advocates to support carbon management, Harden said, it had the opposite effect.\n\n\n“I think it grounded us further in opposition to carbon capture and storage,” she said.\n\n\nMost or all of the environmental justice groups that attended the Wisconsin gathering [signed a public statement](https://www.dscej.org/the-latest/statement-by-environmental-justice-organizations-on-the-national-symposium-on-climate-justice-carbon-management) the following week describing their concerns about carbon capture and removal.\n\n\nOne participant who was granted anonymity to speak freely said the statement arose after the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which runs the Wingspread Retreat, posted a roster of participants on the retreat’s website. Environmental justice groups grew concerned their participation might be seen as a shift toward greater acceptance of carbon capture technologies.\n\n\nThe public statement voices concerns that include some states’ bid to take over permitting for carbon dioxide injection sites, the inadequacy of federal regulatory “guardrails” for carbon management, and taxpayer-funded incentives for the industry.\n\n\nAll, they said, worked against their objective of putting polluting industries out of business.\n\n\n“There is a lack of a holistic consideration of carbon management that ignores the possibilities for a complete transition away from fossil-fueled industries and economies,” the statement reads.\n\n\n#### The sales pitch\n\n\nThree administration officials made the trip to Wisconsin: State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Maxine Burkett; White House Council on Environmental Quality CCS lead Sarah Leung; and Sonrisa Lucero, a special adviser for stakeholder outreach in DOE’s newly expanded Office of Economic Impact and Diversity.\n\n\nEPA did not send a representative, and the agency told E&E News it was unaware of any invitation.\n\n\nThe meeting was also attended by representatives from carbon removal nonprofit Carbon180 and the Carbon Business Council, a trade association for carbon management companies.\n\n\nBurkett, Leung and Lucero focused their remarks on federal programs and funding opportunities for carbon capture and removal created under the infrastructure and climate laws, according to several participants.\n\n\nBeto Lugo Martinez, executive director of CleanAirNow in Kansas City, said the remarks sounded like a sales pitch.\n\n\n“We’ve been in different settings where we’ve heard the same arguments around the [Inflation Reduction Act] funding for CCS and other technologies,” he said. “So it wasn’t something that was new to us.”\n\n\nBurkett, a law professor who has published articles on international climate reparations, spoke about U.S. support for carbon dioxide removal abroad, the State Department said. Her remarks included information about the Biden administration’s efforts to encourage other countries to make carbon capture and removal commitments ahead of this year’s U.N. climate talks in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nIn a statement to E&E News, the department said the U.S. is committed to develop “a robust regulatory framework for research and possible future deployment.”\n\n\nCEQ didn’t provide a readout of Leung’s remarks at the Wingspread meeting. But it said that “on all matters of policy, robust community engagement is essential.”\n\n\n“The Biden-Harris Administration is working to ensure that the advancement of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration technologies is done in a responsible manner that includes meaningful engagement with communities, reflects the best available science, and includes the perspectives and lived experiences of communities with environmental justice concerns,” CEQ spokesperson Alyssa Roberts said in an email.\n\n\nBut environmental justice advocates said participants at the Wingspread meeting didn’t come prepared with answers to their most pressing questions.\n\n\n“I could see that they listened to our concerns, and their task is to take whatever they listen to back to their agencies,” said Huda Alkaff of Wisconsin Green Muslims.\n\n\n#### Consultation or veto?\n\n\nSeveral federal agencies have focused on deepening stakeholder input into commercial carbon capture and storage projects — with the goal of broader deployment.\n\n\n“DOE has made Energy Justice its North Star and for the first time in Department history,” the agency said.\n\n\nThe department pointed to its launch last month of a [$20 million program](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/doe-announces-20-million-available-regional-projects-accelerate-us-carbon-capture) to support and deepen stakeholder consultation for commercial CCS. The department’s press release introducing the program said the initiative would “accelerate” deployment.\n\n\n“Meaningful engagement” with communities was also at the center of CEQ [guidance](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2022/02/16/white-house-ccs-guidance-exposes-environmental-justice-rifts-00008994) last year for CCS development.\n\n\nBut environmental justice groups say communities aren’t guaranteed the right to say “no” to unwanted projects when that consultation is done. And some legal experts have questioned whether the executive branch has the statutory authority to require that consultation in the first place.\n\n\nEnvironmental justice groups plan to flesh out a strategy for keeping industrial carbon management out of their communities, Lugo Martinez said. He said those hadn’t been scheduled yet.\n\n\nThe White House Environmental Justice Advisory Panel — which includes Shepard of WE ACT and Deep South Center for Environmental Justice Executive Director Beverly Wright — is also compiling recommendations for the White House on the environmental justice issues associated with carbon capture and removal. It’s unclear when those will be released. Both declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Environmental justice advocates have concerns regarding the Biden administration's push for carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure, as they fear it will give polluters a lifeline and prolong the suffering of marginalized communities.

The investment is part of a $100 million financing to support the largest biodiverse reforestation effort for carbon removal in the region, enabling Mombak to remove carbon, improve soil quality, enhance biodiversity, and create sustainable economic alternatives for local communities.\n\n“Nature-based solutions could help reduce one-third of the necessary global emissions by the end of the decade, but remain grossly underfunded, with an estimated $700 billion financing gap per year,” said **Maria Kozloski, Senior Vice President of Innovative Finance at The Rockefeller Foundation.** “The Rockefeller Foundation is proud to help close this gap by investing in Mombak’s innovative model that seeks to remove carbon by reforesting the Amazon.”\n\nThe company’s first project in Northern Brazil will plant three million trees with more than 100 native species, including 200,000 seedlings of endangered species. Over one million trees will have been planted by next month, including endangered or vulnerable species such as Cedro Rosa (Cedrela fissilis), Castanheira (Bertholletia excelsa), Itauba (Mezilaurus itauba), Mogno (Swietenia macrophylla), and others. The first project has also had a positive impact on the region, creating over 50 formal jobs in the local municipality. It is expected that Mombak will kick-off multiple additional projects of this kind before the end of 2023.\n\nMombak’s business model is centered on the creation, verification, and sale of carbon removal   credits. It does this by reforesting Brazilian pastureland using native and biodiverse tree species to rebuild the forests of the Amazon. The additional carbon abated from the atmosphere from these new forests produces high-quality carbon removal credits. The credits are then sold via both spot sales and long-term customer offtake agreements.\n\n“The Rockefeller Foundation’s investment reinforces the integrity of our projects,” confirms **Peter Fernandez, CEO and co-founder of Mombak**. “One of the biggest issues in our industry is trust. We are working to create the world’s highest-integrity carbon projects.”\n\nBesides attracting strategic investors, Mombak has also partnered with leading NGOs. “We want to raise the bar in the industry, and we know that our investors and partners will help us in this process. Through an investor and customer-led product development initiative, we dedicated more than a year to meeting the most demanding specifications and requirements with respect to carbon removal, biodiversity, sustainable resource use, and interaction with local communities, among other impact indicators”, says **Fernandez.**\n\n“We are excited to be supporting Mombak’s high-caliber team to fill a critical market gap for high-quality carbon credits,” said **Thomas Belazis, Director of Innovative Finance at The Rockefeller Foundation and manager of the investment**. “Together, alongside world-class investors, we are mobilizing capital into the Amazon to address one of the world’s most pressing climate challenges.”\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation’s $5 million investment in Mombak alongside several blue chip investors represents the latest effort to strengthen the marketplace for carbon credits. From November 2022 to June 2023, The Rockefeller Foundation provided a grant to the [Nature Conservancy](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/grant/nature-conservancy-2022/) to address the lack of investable nature-based solutions projects, and helped co-launch three innovative efforts: the [Energy Transition Accelerator](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/u-s-department-of-state-bezos-earth-fund-and-the-rockefeller-foundation-select-winrock-international-as-the-crediting-body-for-energy-transition/), the [African Carbon Markets Initiative](https://www.energyalliance.org/news-insights/acmi-roadmap/), and the [Coal to Clean Credit Initiative](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundation-and-geapp-to-explore-the-worlds-first-coal-to-clean-credit-program-in-emerging-economies/).\n\n\n\n---\n\n**About Mombak**\n\nMombak was founded in 2021 by Peter Fernandez (former CEO of Brazil’s first unicorn, 99) and Gabriel Silva (former CFO of Brazil’s first “decacorn”, Nubank). They teamed up to leverage their tech backgrounds to solve one of humanity’s most important problems: climate change. Mombak is working to become the world’s largest carbon removal company, starting by reforesting the Amazon rainforest.

On Friday, Summit petitioned regulators to reconsider.\n\n\nOther similar projects are proposed around the country, including ones by Navigator CO2 Ventures and Wolf Carbon Solutions, which would also have routes in Iowa.\n\n\nHere is what to know about Summit's project as more proceedings begin.\n\n\n**What is carbon capture?**\n\n\nCarbon capture entails the gathering and removal of planet-warming CO2 emissions from industrial plants to be pumped deep underground for permanent storage.\n\n\nSupporters view the technology as a combatant of climate change. But opponents say carbon capture and storage isn't proven at scale and could require huge investments at the expense of cheaper alternatives such as solar and wind power, all at a time when there is an urgent need to phase out all fossil fuels.\n\n\nCarbon capture also is viewed by opponents as a way for fossil fuel companies to claim they are addressing climate change without actually having to significantly change their ways.\n\n\n“I think there's a recognition even in the fossil fuel industry that, whether you like it or not and agree or not, (climate change) is a reality you're going to deal with from a regulatory standpoint, and you'd better get out in front of it or you're going to get left behind,\" said Derrick Braaten, a Bismarck-based attorney involved in issues related to Summit’s project.\n\n\nNew federal tax incentives have made carbon capture a lucrative enterprise. The technology has the support of the Biden administration, with billions of dollars approved by Congress for various carbon capture efforts.\n\n\nHigh-profile supporters of Summit's project include North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum, a presidential candidate who has hailed the state's underground CO2 storage ability as a “geologic jackpot,\" and oil magnate Harold Hamm, whose company last year announced a $250 million commitment to Summit's project.\n\n\n“Carbon capture and storage is going to be more and more important every day as we go forward in America,” Hamm has said.\n\n\n**What is happening in the five states?**\n\n\nThe Iowa Utilities Board begins its public evidentiary hearing Tuesday in Fort Dodge, a hearing “anticipated to last several weeks,” according to a news release. The board's final decision on Summit's permit request will come sometime after the hearing.\n\n\nMinnesota's Public Utilities Commission has a hearing set for Aug. 31 in which the panel “will make decisions about the scope of environmental review” regarding Summit's permit application for its pipeline in two counties, said Charley Bruce, an energy facilities planner with the commission.\n\n\nA Summit attorney recently indicated to Minnesota that North Dakota regulators' decision to deny a permit will not affect the company's plans, including for other proposed routes in southern Minnesota.\n\n\nThe South Dakota Public Utilities Commission is set to begin its evidentiary hearing for the project on Sept. 11 and expects to make a final decision by Nov. 15.\n\n\nNebraska has no state-level regulatory authority for CO2 pipelines. Summit is working with counties individually in Nebraska.\n\n\nCounties don't approve or deny a route, but can institute ordinances' setbacks for land-use purposes that can dictate where a pipeline may go, and can enter into road haul agreements and road crossing permits, said Omaha-based attorney Brian Jorde. He represents more than 1,000 landowners opposed to CO2 pipeline projects in four states.\n\n\nSummit hasn't hit “an insurmountable legal obstacle” in North Dakota regulators' denial “because they literally said, ‘Try again,’” Braaten said.\n\n\n\"If they get over themselves I think that they could do it and get approved, but I think they certainly shot themselves in the foot and they're making it much harder in those other states because they're going to come in with those commissioners there looking at them with a certain level of skepticism because you literally just got denied a permit in North Dakota,\" he said.\n\n\n**Why are landowners opposed?**\n\n\nLandowners have raised concerns about the pipeline breaking, as well as eminent domain, or the taking of private land for the project, with compensation.\n\n\nEminent domain laws vary state by state, said Jorde, who represents hundreds of people Summit has sued in South Dakota to take their land for its pipeline.\n\n\n“When you have the power of eminent domain like a hammer over a landowner's head, you can intimidate them into doing things they wouldn't otherwise do, which is sign easements, which Summit then turns around and says, ‘Look at all these “voluntary” easements we have. Look at all the “support” we have,' which is completely false,\" Jorde said.\n\n\nSummit has submitted eminent domain requests to the Iowa board. A Summit spokesperson did not specifically address the company's intentions related to eminent domain when asked by the AP.\n\n\n“Our team remains incredibly encouraged that Iowa landowners have signed voluntary easement agreements accounting for nearly 75% of the proposed pipeline route,\" spokesperson Sabrina Ahmed Zenor said in an email. \"This overwhelming level of support is a clear reflection that they believe like we do that our project will ensure the long-term viability of the ethanol industry, strengthen the agricultural marketplace for farmers, and generate tens of millions of dollars in new revenue for local communities across the Midwest.\"\n\n\n**What about underground storage?**\n\n\nSummit submitted a draft application for underground storage to a three-member state panel which Burgum chairs and includes the attorney general. The timeline for a hearing and decision by the panel is unclear.\n\n\nLast year, Summit and Minnkota Power Cooperative agreed to “co-develop” CO2 storage facilities in central North Dakota. Their agreement gives Summit access to Minnkota's storage site and sets a framework for jointly developing more CO2 storage nearby.\n\n\nMinnkota is pursuing Project Tundra, a project to install carbon capture technology at a coal-fired power plant.\n\n\nBraaten views Summit's Minnkota partnership as a backup plan, to “piggyback on a sure thing,\" he said.\n\n\nA North Dakota landowners' group is suing over the state's process for allowing CO2 and gas storage on private land, and land survey laws.\n\n\nBraaten said the lawsuit, which would affect the permitting of a Summit storage site in North Dakota, is not directed at Summit but is tied to longtime legal battles related to landowner rights.\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Public utility regulators in Iowa will begin a hearing on a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline for transporting emissions for storage underground that has been met with resistance from landowners who fear land taking and pipeline rupture.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Landowners are opposed to the project due to concerns about land taking and pipeline safety."},{"summary":"Carbon capture entails the gathering and removal of CO2 emissions from industrial plants for permanent storage underground.

The significant surge in technological investments aimed at carbon capture and removal stands out as a primary catalyst propelling the upward trajectory of market revenues.\n\n Carbon credits have garnered escalating popularity as both businesses and individuals seek avenues to curtail their contribution to climate change. This inclination has spurred the fossil fuel sector to enhance its operational efficiency. A carbon credit denotes the entitlement to emit either one metric ton of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) or an equivalent measure of other Greenhouse Gases (GHG). This entitlement takes the form of a transferable permit or certificate, known as a carbon credit. It is worth noting that the existing market for carbon offsets presents certain inefficiencies. At present, carbon credits are predominantly traded in bulk quantities to larger corporations, presenting a challenge for smaller entities or individuals desiring to procure offsets for mitigating their environmental impact.\n\n **Request Free Sample Copy (To Understand the Complete Structure of this Report [Summary + TOC]) @** [**https://www.emergenresearch.com/request-sample/2198**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OpfJMwTcDa4YHD0xQYuxeuNI22zcsE5NkJVazvqdkT9gZTML7f1kLgOc0oDCkYUVyzvuiURrv9tSTgKA7BAqABG1DtOXlIplWx9Wv54OuCu8296Z8FL338XIk-U1YMQS4-Oo40vMindGmyuuKYPJSvUYFJ3lRwE9JHcvt7vcRtQ=)\n\n Member states possess the opportunity to secure funds from the Social Climate Fund for financing investments and structural enhancements. These endeavors encompass areas such as zero and low-emission transportation, encompassing public transit, as well as initiatives related to energy conservation, structure revitalization, clean heating and cooling solutions, and the integration of renewable energy sources. Additionally, member states have the discretion to allocate a portion of their budget to offer temporary direct income support. This measure is contingent upon the outcomes stemming from investments aimed at reducing emissions and minimizing energy expenses for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.\n\n However, a notable challenge arises in the form of extended lead times that suppliers encounter while assessing the effectiveness of new carbon credits. This evaluation is a pivotal stage in upholding the integrity of the market. Suppliers engaged in the sale of these credits contend with erratic demand patterns and infrequent access to equitable pricing. The market exhibits a prevailing lack of liquidity, limited financial backing, inadequate risk management services, and restricted availability of data. These combined factors have the potential to impede the growth of market revenue.\n\n **Emergen Research is Offering Limited Time Discount (Grab a Copy at Discounted Price Now) @** [**https://www.emergenresearch.com/request-discount/2198**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OpfJMwTcDa4YHD0xQYuxeuNI22zcsE5NkJVazvqdkT9gZTML7f1kLgOc0oDCkYUV6Ov-bsg4iWc6MxNswp91eXQwqP-a14HWiujDthag6Pda3HBSrgUNGyNevBNxQA7HPajK2W0rBwgTPruk_1DOZNCOcBVLiYq6pg4-KJa8ljhibmYixAKMGTi6F6h5KBSR)\n\n **Scope of Research** \n\n \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Report Details** | **Outcome** |\n| Market Size in 2022 | USD 107.2 Million |\n| CAGR (2023–2032) | 25.5% |\n| Revenue Forecast To 2032 | USD 1,019.3 Million |\n| Base Year For Estimation | 2022 |\n| Historical Data | 2019–2021 |\n| Forecast Period | 2023–2032 |\n| Quantitative Units | Revenue in USD Million and CAGR in % from 2023 to 2032 |\n| Report Coverage | Revenue forecast, company ranking, competitive landscape, growth factors, and trends |\n| Segments Covered | Type, system type, platform type, technology, end-use, and region |\n| Regional Scope | North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa |\n| Country Scope | U.S., Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, UK, Italy, Spain, Benelux, Rest of Europe, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Rest of APAC, Brazil, Rest of LATAM, Saudi Arabia, UAE, South Africa, Turkey, and Rest of Middle East & Africa |\n| Key Companies Profiled | Nasdaq Inc., EEX Group, AirCarbon Exchange, Carbon Trade Exchange, IHS Markit, CME Group, Climate Impact X, Carbonplace, Likvidi¸ BetaCarbon, ClimateTrade, Veridium, and ShiftCabon. |\n| Customization Scope | 10 hours of free customization and expert consultation |\n\n **Major Companies and Competitive Landscape** \n\n The global carbon credit trading platform market is consolidated, with few companies accounting for majority market revenue.

This is because VCM is unregulated by the government and need for VCM has increased due to Paris Agreement's strict business net zero goals. The VCM works on a voluntary basis, allowing organizations and people to go above and beyond mandated targets in their climate action. Participants in the VCM can purchase carbon credits from programs, such as renewable energy, forestry, or energy efficiency, that reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Organizations as well as people can claim to have offset their own carbon emissions by buying these credits, aiding in efforts to mitigate global warming.\n* The exchange platforms segment accounted for largest revenue share in 2022. This is because exchanges for carbon credits can be made secure, standardized, and in real time using blockchain technology. This contains all the data about carbon credit, which may be used including transaction records, auditing, third-party certification information, and project monitoring.\n* The Asia Pacific market is expected to register fastest revenue growth rate in the global carbon credit trading platform market during the forecast period. This is because Asia Pacific market has many carbon exchanges, which are becoming more significant in the struggle against climate change. Singapore has instituted a required carbon tax since 2019 to incentivize businesses to cut their emissions, while South Korea became the first developing economy to establish a countrywide mandatory Emissions Trading System (ETS).\n* On 13 September 2021, The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia intends to set up a trading system for carbon offsets and credits throughout the Middle East and North Africa region, working with the Saudi Tadawul Group (Saudi Stock Exchange). Since current regulations permit the worldwide transfer of credits, both local and foreign carbon emitters can trade on this market.\n\n **Browse Full Report Description + Research Methodology + Table of Content + Infographics@** **[https://www.emergenresearch.com/industry-report/carbon-credit-trading-platform-market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OpfJMwTcDa4YHD0xQYuxeuNI22zcsE5NkJVazvqdkT_WI5cLVBzoburCs8vicvCxx4hBaHjSjjjUoacjQarJWbFOEJOs38ybJvuCLbflVIw0aB-8mkfK4XbXRpb3xuPxhhZgJ_n53-kIb8i_feF-xmB-cDimGs_z0EcMrEHYHt902S4caG0ZouGIKiWOAEuhhnx44ngl2oWimA75Q9iC0rk0ParMhqiRlGblGHi8R5cQnIOPLXMXeu6GOVYI5UGk2DdkYz_bv_ZBWhpCJ4hLTg==)**\n\n  **Emergen Research has segmented the** **global** **carbon credit trading platform market** **on the basis of type, system type, platform type, technology, end-use, and region:**\n\n * **Type Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2019–2032)**\n\t+ Voluntary Carbon Market\n\t+ Regulated Carbon market\n* **System Type Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2019–2032)**\n\t+ Cap and Trade\n\t+ Baseline and Credit\n* **Platform Type Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2019–2032)**\n\t+ Exchange Platforms\n\t+ Registry Platforms\n* **Technology Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2019–2032)**\n\t+ Blockchain-based Platforms\n\t+ Others\n* **End-Use Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2019–2032)**\n\t+ Industrial\n\t+ Energy & Utilities\n\t+ Petrochemicals\n\t+ Aviation\n\t+ Others\n* **Regional Outlook (Revenue, USD Million; 2019–2030)**\n\t+ North America\n\t\t1.

Read the previous articles in this series: [Climate literacy training for every budget](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/climate-literacy-training-every-budget), [10 resources for scaling corporate climate literacy](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/10-resources-improving-corporate-climate-literacy) and [Need sustainability strategy training? Look here](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/need-sustainability-strategy-training-look-here).*\n\n\nToday’s installment provides 11 training offerings that can help you learn how to set greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals — including Science-Based and net-zero targets — and how to develop a strategy for achieving those goals. There’s even training on how to evaluate net-zero plans so you can spot opportunities to improve existing strategies.  If you’re excited to learn about net zero, be sure to attend [GreenBiz Net Zero](https://www.greenbiz.com/events/net-zero/2023/registration) on Sept. 7.  It’s a free, online, collaborative experience with small-group discussions and solution-forward workshops designed to equip you with cutting-edge strategies proven to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions.  \n\n\nAccording to the [2023 Net Zero Stocktake report](https://newclimate.org/resources/publications/net-zero-stocktake-2023), the number of the world’s top 2,000 publicly listed companies with net-zero targets has more than doubled in a little over two years — from 417 to 929. That’s great news, but unfortunately it means that more than half of the world’s largest companies still don’t have net-zero goals. The report also points out that many of the emission reduction targets that do exist don’t meet the [UNFCCC Race to Zero criteria](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/race-to-zero-campaign#Minimum-criteria-required-for-participation-in-the-Race-to-Zero-campaign), which establish what “good” net-zero goals and implementation look like.  \n\n\nPut simply, the report is telling us that we need to do better, from both a goal-setting perspective and an execution perspective. If you’d like to learn how to help your organization do better, read on. \n\n\nAs is often the case with these types of lists, I’m sure I've missed some.

Several candidate measures are being discussed at the International Maritime Organization, including market-based measures (MBMs) and environmental policies such as carbon taxes and emissions trading systems, as means to decarbonize. Their implementation increases the cost of fossil fuel consumption and provides fiscal incentives to shipping stakeholders to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions reductions. MBMs can bridge the price gap between alternative and conventional fuels and generate revenues for funding the up-scaling of alternative fuels’ production, storage and distribution facilities and, thus, enhance their availability. By estimating the fuels’ implementation and operational costs and carbon abatement potential, this study calculates marginal abatement costs and estimates the level of carbon pricing needed to render investments into alternative fuels cost-effective. The results can assist policymakers in establishing robust and effective maritime decarbonization policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Access through your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41560-023-01334-4)\n\n\n[Buy or subscribe](#access-options)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [access via your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41560-023-01334-4)\n\n\n\nAccess options\n--------------\n\n\n\n\n\n[Access through your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41560-023-01334-4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Access through your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41560-023-01334-4)\n\n\n[Change institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41560-023-01334-4)\n\n\n[Buy or subscribe](#access-options)\n\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n24,99 € / 30 days\n\ncancel any time\n\n[Learn more](https://shop.nature.com/products/plus)Subscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 12 digital issues and online access to articles\n\n111,21 € per year\n\nonly 9,27 € per issue\n\n[Learn more](/nenergy/subscribe)Rent or buy this article\n\nPrices vary by article type\n\nfrom$1.95\n\nto$39.95\n\n[Learn more](//www.nature.com/articles/s41560-023-01334-4.epdf?no_publisher_access=1&r3_referer=nature)Prices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\n\n\n### Additional access options:\n\n\n* [Log in](https://idp.nature.com/authorize/natureuser?client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41560-023-01334-4)\n* [Learn about institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/license-options)\n* [Read our FAQs](https://support.nature.com/en/support/home)\n* [Contact customer support](https://www.springernature.com/gp/contact)\n\n\n\n\n**Fig. 1: MACs and GHG abatement potential of alternative marine fuels for a newbuilding vessel.**![](//media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41560-023-01334-4/MediaObjects/41560_2023_1334_Fig1_HTML.png)**Fig. 2: MACs and abatement potentials of alternative fuels for a retrofit of a 5-year-old diesel ICE vessel.**![](//media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41560-023-01334-4/MediaObjects/41560_2023_1334_Fig2_HTML.png)**Fig. 3: MACs and abatement potentials of alternative fuels for a retrofit of a 10-year-old diesel ICE vessel.**![](//media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41560-023-01334-4/MediaObjects/41560_2023_1334_Fig3_HTML.png)**Fig. 4: MACs and abatement potentials of alternative fuels for a retrofit of a 5-year-old LNG ICE vessel.**![](//media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41560-023-01334-4/MediaObjects/41560_2023_1334_Fig4_HTML.png)**Fig. 5: MACs and abatement potentials of alternative fuels for a retrofit of a 10-year-old LNG ICE vessel.**![](//media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41560-023-01334-4/MediaObjects/41560_2023_1334_Fig5_HTML.png)**Fig. 6: Summary of the range of carbon prices and the percentage of GHG emissions reduction achieved for each alternative fuel.**![](//media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41560-023-01334-4/MediaObjects/41560_2023_1334_Fig6_HTML.png)\n\n\nData availability\n-----------------\n\n\nThe data set is included in the online version of the published article and its [Supplementary Information](/articles/s41560-023-01334-4#MOESM1).

The carbon credit sector, currently unregulated, is a flourishing $2bn market. Companies utilise these credits to counterbalance their environmental footprint. These credits emerge from various eco-conscious initiatives, from tree-planting schemes to the capture of industrial gases.\n\n\nKimmeridge Energy, having invested in Civitas Resources (CIVI.N) – celebrated as Colorado’s inaugural carbon-neutral energy producer – has also placed its bets on Chestnut Carbon, a dedicated producer of offsets.\n\n\nThe primary goal is to tackle rising emissions, with scientists advocating for the extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere as a pivotal step towards achieving global climate targets. However, there’s a rising wave of scepticism about these voluntary carbon markets, with critics challenging their transparency and genuine environmental benefits.\n\n\nIn a bid to address these concerns, Kimmeridge’s report recommends implementing a universal scale to evaluate all project types. Drawing parallels between the voluntary carbon markets and the bond market, it lays out a chain comprising four main players: regulator, auditor, rating agency, and the buyer pool.\n\n\nIn an interesting development, an independent governance body named the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) shared its set of criteria for establishing new benchmarks in the carbon offsets market just a month ago.\n\n\nKeep up with all the latest [FinTech news here](https://fintech.global/category/fintech-news/).\n\n\nCopyright © 2023 FinTech Global\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoying the stories?\n\n\nSubscribe to our daily FinTech newsletter and get the latest industry news & research\n\n\n\n\n![](https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad-pro-mockup-with-a-solid-color-backdrop-988-el_1-300x225.webp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Activist investor Ben Dell proposes rating carbon credits like bonds to instil buyer confidence in their impact on reducing global emissions.","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"The proposal aims to instil confidence in buyers, suggesting a positive outlook for the carbon credit market."},{"summary":"The carbon credit sector is currently unregulated and worth $2bn, utilized by companies to counterbalance their environmental footprint.","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"The information provides a neutral description of the current state and value of the carbon credit market."},{"summary":"Kimmeridge Energy has invested in carbon-neutral energy producer Civitas Resources and dedicated offset producer Chestnut Carbon.","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"The investments in carbon-neutral energy and offset production suggest a positive outlook for reducing emissions."},{"summary":"There is rising scepticism about the transparency and environmental benefits of voluntary carbon markets.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"The rising scepticism suggests a negative sentiment towards the current state of the voluntary carbon markets."},{"summary":"Kimmeridge's report recommends implementing a universal scale to evaluate all project types in carbon markets, drawing parallels to the bond market.","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"The recommendation provides a neutral description of a proposal to improve carbon markets."},{"summary":"The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) recently shared criteria for establishing new benchmarks in carbon offsets.","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"The establishment of new benchmarks suggests a positive effort to improve the carbon offsets market."}],"semantic_commentary":"Proposed rating system aims to increase buyer confidence in carbon credits.","sentiment_score":0.3333333333333333,"classifications":[{"category":"category_s1","reason":"The article discusses systems and policies related to carbon credits and their impact on reducing global emissions."},{"category":"category_d1","reason":"The article mentions companies investing in carbon-neutral energy and offset producers to reduce their environmental footprint."},{"category":"category_n1","reason":"The article mentions news about carbon markets and rising scepticism about their transparency and environmental benefits."}]},{"source":"The Lever","link":"https://www.levernews.com/the-climate-culprits-hiding-their-role-in-californias-extreme-weather/","title":"The Climate Culprits Hiding Their Role In California’s Extreme Weather","content":"\nOne of the nation’s most important climate fights is currently playing out under the radar in California, where state residents are weathering an [unprecedented tropical storm](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tropical-storm-hilary-palm-springs-california-flooding-video-images/). Oil and industry lobbying groups are spending millions in a last-ditch attempt to block first-of-its-kind legislation that would require thousands of large companies doing business in the state to fully disclose their carbon emissions, a move that would effectively set national policy.\n\nIn the final weeks of California’s legislative session, which ends in mid-September, Assembly members are expected to vote on the climate transparency bill. With a federal version of the measure still [delayed](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/sec-eyes-october-for-climate-disclosure-regulations-release) — and nearly certain to face lengthy [legal challenges](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/05/10/secs-climate-risk-disclosure-proposal-likely-to-face-legal-challenges/#:~:text=There%20are%20at%20least%20four,major%20questions%20of%20climate%20change) from industry — California’s legislation could expedite a public reckoning over corporations’ true contributions to climate change.\n\nThe bill has already passed the state Senate, and if it survives a [secretive appropriations hearing](https://calmatters.org/newsletters/whatmatters/2022/05/california-capitol-secretive-process/) later this month, it will go before the full Assembly — where a previous version [failed by just four votes](https://trackbill.com/bill/california-senate-bill-260-climate-corporate-accountability-act/2002689/) last year following a fierce opposition campaign.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who has been [burnishing his climate credentials](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/14/newsom-climate-diplomacy-00110622) for a [possible presidential run](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/election/presidential-election/article277938603.html), has yet to weigh in on this year’s climate proposals in his state.

If the measure passes, all of those companies will be required, for the first time, to calculate the carbon emissions that occur across their value chain — not just those involved directly in their day-to-day operations. Such indirect emissions [can account](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/Scope%203%20Detailed%20FAQ.pdf) for nearly 90 percent of a company’s total carbon footprint.\n\n[Most](https://www.delta.com/us/en/about-delta/sustainability#:~:text=We%20are%20committed%20to%20Net,is%20innately%20difficult%20to%20decarbonize.)

The oil and gas giant’s [“2050 net-zero aspiration”](https://www.chevron.com/newsroom/2021/q4/chevron-sets-net-zero-aspiration-and-new-ghg-intensity-target) depends on “canceling out” emissions through the purchase of so-called [carbon offsets](https://www.spglobal.com/esg/insights/carbon-offsets-prove-risky-business-for-net-zero-targets) that supposedly subsidize climate-friendly projects elsewhere. But a [recent report](https://corporateaccountability.org/resources/chevrons-junk-agenda-report/) concluded that more than 90 percent of those offsets should be “presumed ‘junk’ until proven otherwise.”\n\n“We are awash in greenwashing,” Gerrard said. “We need standards to set forth what a legitimate net-zero commitment is.”\n\n💡Follow us on [**Apple News**](https://apple.news/TeRci1RtoQfWCNA5h7NTBlg) and [**Google News**](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMPvKngswktW2Aw) to make sure you see our stories first, and to help make sure others see our breaking news as well.### As Goes California\n\nMore than a year ago, the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [proposed](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46) rules requiring public companies to disclose [climate risks](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/climate-change-investing-risks-threats-opportunities) to their bottom line, a category that encompasses everything from manufacturing facilities in flood-prone areas to oil holdings that could drop in value as the energy transition proceeds.\n\nThe SEC proposal stops well short of rules [already on the books](https://time.com/6282880/why-eu-climate-corporate-disclosure-rules-matter/) in the European Union, which require companies to report the risks that their business models [pose to the broader environment](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/fisma/items/754701/en), not just investors. But that approach hasn’t stopped the GOP from [attacking the proposed rule](https://www.cfodive.com/news/house-republicans-target-sec-climate-risk-rule-sustainability-esg/642119/) as part of its broader [war against sustainable investing](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/10/house-gop-treads-lightly-in-culture-war-on-wall-street-00104991) and [SEC Chairman Gary Gensler](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-introduce-bill-remove-sec-chair-gary-gensler) for his role in the proposal.\n\nThis month, more than 80 congressional Democrats [sent a letter](https://casten.house.gov/imo/media/doc/casten_castor_vargas_letter_to_sec.pdf) to Gensler urging him to enact the new climate reporting requirements as quickly as possible. A final rule [could come this fall](https://www.verdantix.com/insights/blogs/sec-will-vote-on-climate-rule-in-october-with-potential-to-implement-from-january-2024#:~:text=30%2C%20June%202023-,SEC%20Will%20Vote%20On%20Climate%20Rule%20In%20October%2C%20With%20Potential,31st%20%E2%80%93%20at%20the%20latest.), but the agency is [reportedly mulling](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/04/sec-climate-rule-scale-back-00081181) watering down its requirements. The draft rule drew a [record-breaking 14,000 comments](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/07/03/__trashed-4/) and widespread pushback from business lobbying groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAs its parent organization fights to kill federal rules, the California Chamber of Commerce has led opposition to state climate disclosure legislation [on the grounds that it is “premature”](https://ct3.blob.core.windows.net/21blobs/0cbe1f91-d28a-403a-a3d9-6e3c44627e1b) while those federal rules are pending.\n\nThe state Chamber of Commerce [donated nearly $1.4 million](https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&d-eid=17299&s=CA&y=2022) to candidates for state legislature last year. Defeating the climate disclosure bill, introduced in January by state Sen. Scott Wiener (D), is one of the group’s [top priorities](https://advocacy.calchamber.com/2023/08/16/onerous-emissions-tracking-bill-to-be-heard-in-assembly-committee-today/) this session.\n\nLast year, the bill fell just four votes short of passage when corporate Democrats [joined with Republicans](https://www.levernews.com/why-in-n-out-burger-is-fighting-a-landmark-climate-bill/) to block it on the Assembly floor. Fourteen of the current Democratic Assembly members who abstained or voted “no” last August have received a total of $327,000 from gas and oil interests during the last election cycle, according to data from the National Institute for Money in Politics.\n\n[Donate To The Lever](https://levernews.com/donate)Three of those Democrats — Assemblymembers Joaquin Arambula, David Alvarez, and Jacqui Irwin — changed their “yes” votes to abstentions at the last minute, helping ensure the bill’s defeat.\n\nAsked by *The Lever* about how he plans to vote this year, a spokesperson for Arambula said that he was studying the bill. Alvarez and Irwin did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n“We feel pretty confident that we have a path to passing it,” said Melissa Romero, senior legislative manager for California Environmental Voters, a key backer of the plan. “But our opposition is stacked with the most influential moneyed interests in the state.”\n\nWiener’s bill would apply to more than [5,300 large companies](https://www.ceres.org/news-center/press-releases/companies-call-climate-disclosure-legislation-california-lawmakers#:~:text=If%20passed%2C%20the%20bills%20would,the%20world's%20fifth%2Dlargest%20economy.) doing business in the state, regardless of whether they’re publicly traded, effectively setting new nationwide standards.\n\nNothing in the new measures, should they pass, requires companies to actually reduce their emissions — just to calculate and disclose them. But past environmental regulations, including those [governing the release of toxic chemicals](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program), show that mandatory disclosure is an important first step toward fast and efficient decarbonization, according to Columbia University’s Gerrard.\n\n“It’s a very important part of the toolbox,” he said. “I have very little sympathy for the companies that are complaining about the burdens of this kind of disclosure. These are orders of magnitude lower than the burdens that climate change itself is imposing.”\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Oil and industry lobbying groups are spending millions to block legislation in California that would require large companies to fully disclose their carbon emissions.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Opposition from oil and industry lobbying groups"},{"summary":"The climate transparency bill has already passed the state Senate and will go before the full Assembly in California.","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"No clear positive or negative sentiment"},{"summary":"Industry opponents have spent more than $7 million on lobbying efforts to influence or block the disclosure bill in California.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Significant spending against the bill from industry opponents"},{"summary":"Companies like Chevron have set voluntary net-zero commitments, but critics argue that they are often just 'greenwashing'.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Criticism of voluntary net-zero commitments"},{"summary":"The California Chamber of Commerce has led opposition to the climate disclosure legislation, donating nearly $1.4 million to candidates for state legislature.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Opposition from the California Chamber of Commerce"},{"summary":"Melissa Romero, senior legislative manager for California Environmental Voters, is confident in passing the bill despite opposition from influential interests.","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"Confidence in passing the bill"},{"summary":"The climate transparency bill in California would require companies to calculate and disclose their carbon emissions as a first step towards decarbonization.","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"Importance of mandatory disclosure for decarbonization"}],"semantic_commentary":"Intent: Selling carbon credits to organizations reducing carbon emissions.\n\nComment: Lobbying blocks California bill on carbon emissions disclosure.","sentiment_score":-0.2857142857142857,"classifications":[{"category":"category_d1","reason":"The article mentions companies committing to reducing their carbon footprint and making net-zero commitments."},{"category":"category_n1","reason":"The article discusses news about carbon emissions and the climate transparency bill in California."},{"category":"category_s1","reason":"The article relates to policies and legislation aimed at reducing carbon emissions and achieving decarbonization."}]},{"source":"Reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/germanys-climate-efforts-not-enough-hit-2030-targets-experts-say-2023-08-22/","title":"Germany set to miss net zero by 2045 target as climate efforts falter | Reuters","content":"BERLIN, Aug 22 (Reuters) - German goals to cut greenhouse emissions by 65% by 2030 are likely to be missed, meaning a longer-term net zero by a 2045 target is also in doubt, reports by government climate advisers and the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) show.\n\nThe European Union has sought to be a climate leader and Germany has set itself [more ambitious](/business/environment/germany-raise-2030-co2-emissions-reduction-target-65-spiegel-2021-05-05/) targets than the bloc as a whole, but in many countries politics and the economic crisis have pushed the [climate crisis](/sustainability/greenlash-fuels-fears-europes-environmental-ambitions-2023-08-10/) down the agenda.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continueGermany, Europe's largest economy, aims to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 65% by 2030 compared with 1990. Last year its CO2 levels were already 40% below the 1990 level, but the new reports said that was not enough.\n\n\"The expected overall reduction is probably overestimated,\" Hans-Martin Henning, the chairman of a council of climate experts that advises the government, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continueThe German government has ordered 130 measures in various sectors. The buildings and transport sectors in particular are failing to implement them, the council of government climate advisers' report said.\n\nThe buildings sector is expected to be 35 million tonnes of CO2 short of target by 2030, while the transport sector is expected to have excess emissions of between 117 million and 191 million tonnes compared with the government target.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continueTuesday's advisers' report coincided with another from the UBA that found that Germany cannot become climate neutral by 2045 on the basis of planned and existing government climate policy.\n\nIt drafted two scenarios, one for current policy and one for planned, that found that only 82% and 86% of targeted emissions cuts compared to 1990 would be achieved.\n\n\"According to the current status, Germany would still emit 229 million tonnes of climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions in the target year 2045,\" the UBA report found.\n\nGOVERNMENT PROMISES\n-------------------\n\nThe economy ministry said policies it has implemented since the current government took office in late 2021 would cut around 80% of the surplus CO2 emissions it said were a legacy of policies by the previous government.

This statistic shows that gas is still playing a crucial role in meeting the country’s energy needs.\n\n\nHowever, the energy industry and the government are under increasing pressure to reduce consumer reliance on natural gas and decarbonise the country’s fuel supply.\n\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) technology could play a significant role in the UK’s net zero energy transition. For example, CCS can reduce emissions from industries that are difficult to decarbonise, such as steel or glass production.\n\n\nMoreover, CCS can support the generation of low-carbon hydrogen and biomethane, contributing to a more flexible energy supply and supporting power generation from wind and solar energy on still and overcast days.\n\n\n### Supporting the energy transition\n\n\nCCS is a process used to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the source, storing them underground where they can be kept out of the atmosphere. This has the potential to make carbon-emitting processes carbon neutral.\n\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario forecasts that carbon capture technology will play a significant role in the UK’s energy transition, particularly in industries that are difficult to decarbonise.\n\n\nHowever, like any new technology, CCS has its benefits and limitations, all of which need to be considered.\n\n\nAt Xoserve, we recognise that to meet the UK’s climate goals, we will need a flexible power system that can support the gap between renewable energy output and demand, currently being met by gas.\n\n\nTo enhance energy security – an increasing priority for governments worldwide – we need a whole-system solution that integrates a mix of fuel sources and technologies, rather than a one-solution approach.\n\n\n### Decarbonising natural gas in the short term\n\n\nOne of the main benefits of CCS technology is that it could offer a short-term solution to decarbonise natural gas. This could be a good approach while we build renewable energy policy and infrastructure to replace the 738Twh of energy that gas produces annually.\n\n\nFor example, a low-carbon gas such as hydrogen is seen by many as a crucial component of a future energy system. CCS would play a vital role in the production of blue hydrogen – generated from natural gas alongside CCS – when [hydrogen generated from renewable sources](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/hydrogen-production-technology-unparalleled-ci-hydrogen/32552/) is unavailable.\n\n\nAs a result, carbon capture could help support the decarbonisation of the gas network with low-carbon hydrogen.\n\n\n![](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/©-shutterstockDmitry-Kovalchuk_2061473576-1-300x169.jpg)© shutterstock/Dmitry Kovalchuk\nFor other low-carbon gases, such as biomethane, CCS allows the capture of CO2 during the production process, while in the past it used to be vented into the atmosphere. With direct air capture and CCS, the carbon dioxide can be either repurposed for industrial applications – for example, in breweries – or safely sequestered.\n\n\n### Limitations of carbon capture technology: Cost and scalability challenges\n\n\nDespite its potential benefits, carbon capture technology is not without limitations. For example, there are challenges around scalability, long-term security, and cost. The technology is still relatively expensive and requires significant investment to build and operate the necessary infrastructure, which some believe should instead be invested in growing renewable energy projects.\n\n\nFinding suitable storage sites is also a major hurdle to overcome, as the trapped CO2 underground needs to be monitored for centuries to ensure it is not released into the atmosphere.\n\n\nTo avoid this, we need to identify safe storage locations and implement a long-term monitoring plan for CCS to ensure it effectively contributes to combating climate change long-term.\n\n\nQuestions about the scalability of carbon capture technology have also been raised.\n\n\nAlthough the technology can reduce emissions in individual facilities, it is unclear whether it can be scaled up to a level that would have a significant impact on emissions at a national scale. If that were a possibility, there are further concerns that CCS could encourage prolonged use and investment in fossil fuels, hindering efforts to switch to greener energy sources.\n\n\nCCS may also prove challenging in a domestic setting – for example, putting a mechanism to capture carbon on a cooker or boiler seems ludicrous. With 80% of carbon emissions produced by domestic heat and cooking, CCS and storage wouldn’t be as effective in addressing the lion’s share of carbon emissions, and the energy industry would need to look at alternative solutions for decarbonising homes.\n\n\n### Current CCS projects\n\n\nThe UK has positioned itself as one of the global leaders in the development and deployment of CCS technology. Earlier this year, Grant Shapps, the Energy and Net Zero Secretary, unveiled the “powering up Britain” strategy, which included a £20bn investment in developing carbon capture technology to meet consumer demand and transition to net zero.\n\n\n![](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/©-shutterstockwasanajai_2342785359-300x169.jpg)© shutterstock/wasanajai\nThe country already has several CCS projects underway, including HyNet, an industrial decarbonisation project in the North-West and North Wales to capture the carbon dioxide currently generated from burning natural gas as a fuel or as part of the manufacturing process.\n\n\nRecently, it was announced that two projects, Acorn and Viking, located in northeast Scotland and Humberside, respectively, have been selected to become CCS clusters.\n\n\nThese projects aim at establishing low-carbon industrial hubs, improving energy security, and decreasing carbon emissions. Viking, in particular, plans to transport and store up to 15 million tonnes of CO2 every year by 2035.\n\n\n### CCS isn’t the solution to climate change\n\n\nThe UK’s commitment to CCS demonstrates that the country believes in this technology’s crucial role in the energy transition. Yet, the notion that “it starts at home” has never rung so true. The energy industry and government must focus on how to decarbonise our homes to make a significant impact on climate change, and in my opinion, carbon capture isn’t the answer.\n\n\nCCS as part of a broader suite of decarbonisation solutions can support energy demand where power from solar and wind fall short.\n\n\nHowever, the priority needs to be on reducing carbon emissions at the point of generation by investing in renewable energy and utilising existing grid and gas infrastructure.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributor Details\n\n\n\n\n### Victoria Mustard\n\n\n\n\n Decarbonisation Strategy Lead \n\n Xoserve \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Subscribe to our newsletter](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/mk-banners/banner-inn-subscribe-001-1080x312-001.jpg)](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/subscribe/ \"Subscribe to our newsletter\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### \nRecommended Articles\n\n\n\n\n* [![carbon capture technology](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/©-shutterstockSutthiphong-Chandaeng_2319899697-265x198.jpg)](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/how-does-carbon-capture-technology-work/34043/) \n\n\nEDITOR'S PICK  \n\n [How does carbon capture technology work?](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/how-does-carbon-capture-technology-work/34043/)\n* [![carbon capture technology](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Image-1-©-shutterstock3rdtimeluckystudio_2249989603-265x198.jpg)](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/carbon-capture-technology-and-the-green-frontier/29949/) \n\n\nEDITOR'S PICK  \n\n [Carbon capture technology and the green frontier](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/carbon-capture-technology-and-the-green-frontier/29949/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology can play a significant role in the UK's net-zero energy transition by reducing emissions from industries that are difficult to decarbonize and supporting the generation of low-carbon hydrogen and biomethane.","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"CCS technology can contribute to decarbonization efforts and support the transition to renewable energy sources."},{"summary":"CCS offers a short-term solution to decarbonize natural gas, particularly in the production of blue hydrogen and biomethane.

However, the company was still on track for a +2ºC pathway and thus “still has some work to do”, said Planet Tracker research analyst Ion Visinovschi.\n\n\n“Our comparison of leading consumer goods companies demonstrates a worrying trend of companies failing to effectively tackle direct Scope 3 emissions, especially upstream, which if not mitigated soon could cost billions of dollars in the future.\n\n\n“The comparison between companies allows us to see how far behind giants like Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble are from the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement.”\n\n\nVisinovschi said investors should continue to urge companies to increase their ambitions on Scope 3 emissions they have a direct impact on, such as their supply chain, given the “substantial economic and market risks associated with inaction”.\n\n\nA Unilever spokeswoman said: “Unilever welcomes Planet Tracker’s report. Back in 2021, we were one of the first companies of our size to put a Climate Transition Action Plan to a shareholder vote, which was approved with 99.6% of votes cast.\n\n\n“We committed to updating this public plan every three years and are currently working towards an update in time for our annual general meeting next year. With this context, the report is timely and helpful for us as we look to continually improve our Climate Transition Action Plan.”\n\n\nFood industry companies have long received criticism from environmental campaigners and those in the green financing sector for failing to publish detailed plans for targeting Scope 3 emissions across their supply chains.\n\n\nLarge businesses such as Unilever, [Danone](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/danone/867.subject) and [Tesco](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/tesco/172.subject) have only recently begun to include climate risks in their annual P&L reporting, in alignment with the UN’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n\nNow a legal bind, the TCFD framework forces companies to place a financial value on the risk of climate breakdown, encouraging the risks to be valued as much by commercial teams as those focused on sustainability.\n\n\nIt will also prevent companies from making unsubstantiated claims about their carbon emissions as investors will have a breakdown of all the data and costs associated with net zero targets.\n\n\nTesco is now leading the way in the retail sphere after [having had its net zero targets validated by the SBTi](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/tesco/tesco-net-zero-commitments-receive-backing-from-global-climate-body/682057.article).

To address climate change, apart from setting science-based targets, WNC has also become a member of RE100 and added its signature to the TCFD official website to support the TCFD initiative. WNC's Chief Sustainability Officer Molly Lin noted \"We cannot ignore climate change and the threat it poses to our planet. We must accelerate our efforts in creating a low-carbon industry chain, with the ultimate goal being to achieve net-zero emissions.\"\n \n\n\n The SBTi is a collaboration between the CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The mission of this initiative is to develop tools and guidelines as well as provide technical support to enable businesses to set carbon reduction targets.\n \n\n\n To respond to SBTi's call for urgent action regarding climate change, WNC has set near-term and net-zero targets in accordance with SBTi criteria. Using 2022 as the base year, WNC aims to achieve a 42% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n \n\n\n WNC's strategy for reducing Scope 2 emissions revolves around increasing its use of renewable energy. Specific action items include green power generation for self-use, purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with electricity suppliers. Annual targets to gradually increase the use of renewables will be set, aiming to reach 100% renewable energy usage by 2040.\n \n\n\n Established in 2022, WNC's Sustainable Development Committee works in concert with the company's top-tier managers to formulate sustainable development strategies, plans and targets, with the ultimate goal being to establish a mutually beneficial and sustainable industry environment. Prior to signing the SBTi commitment letter, the Committee had already listed science-based reduction targets as one of its key ESG indicators. Through leveraging advanced R&D capabilities to develop more efficient products and services, using renewable materials, and implementing a supplier management mechanism and product carbon footprint project, WNC is doing its part in reducing emissions, and we hope that in the future our supply chain partners in the network communications industry can also join the SBTi, so together we can work toward reducing emissions and establishing a low-carbon ecosystem for the industry.\n \n\n**About SBTi**  \n\n The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global body enabling businesses to set ambitious emissions reduction targets in line with the latest climate science. The initiative is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi's Net-Zero Standard is the world's first net-zero corporate standard, and the goal of this standard aligns with the recommendation set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.  \n\n\n**Attachments**\n\n* Original Link\n* Original Document\n* Permalink\n**Disclaimer**\n\n**Wistron NeWeb Corp.** published this content on **22 August 2023** and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Agency. Earlier this year, £85,000 was shared between between nine UK organisations.**\n\n\nThe ten new projects will will receive up to £55,000 and will use Earth observation tools, satellite tracking and data on population demographics, supported by AI, ‘to produce forecasts and models that can be used by sectors ranging from agriculture and energy, to finance and insurance.’\n\n\n![](https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/UK-heatwave-__-Credit_-ESA-1-scaled-e1692645279169-300x209.jpg)\n\n\nBeginning development in September, the expectation is that collectively, these projects will advance our ability to address issues such as methane and nitrous oxide emissions, watercourse resilience, biodiversity changes and the infrastructure of decarbonising technologies. \n\n\nOne of the successful applications was by EOLAS Insight who plan to develop a mapping and reporting service focused on watercourse resilience, helping businesses understand the benefits of investing in mitigation strategies, such as riverside woodland schemes.\n\n\nBrighton-based Recycle2Trade will monitor environmental sites, Aberdeen-based TrackGenesis will combine Earth observation and Global Navigation Systems to support food production in a changing climate and Edinburgh-based Trade In Space’s project will look at deforestation connected to smallholder farming. \n\n\nMinister of State at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology George Freeman MP, said: ‘The great challenges of our time need bold solutions and from tackling water pollution to carbon emissions and biodiversity threats, the unique perspective that space provides can play a major role in securing the health of our planet and people.\n\n\n‘By backing UK innovators to make the most of modern technology including satellite data, AI, and Earth observation, we are also supporting businesses up and down our country to grow our economy while driving forward our ambition to make the UK a major player in space.’\n\n\nDr Paul Bate, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, said: ‘The UK has a long history of expertise and innovation in Earth observation, developing satellites to collect increasingly detailed data and using that information to build services that help protect our planet.\n\n\n‘This targeted funding for early-stage innovations is all about supporting fresh ideas and accelerating the rollout of powerful new tools that have the potential to bring benefits to a wide range of users both within and beyond the space sector.’\n\n\n[![](https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/728X90px_Lords_2023_leader_banner.gif)](https://airqualitynews.com/events/event/aqnldn2023/)\n","summaries":[{"summary":"The UK Space Agency has awarded £530,000 in funding for ten new climate-focused projects.

Through this process, we inevitably receive some frequently asked questions. One of which is surrounding our use of futures contracts to gain exposure.\n\n\n\n\nFutures contracts are the most liquid, transparent, efficient, and exchange-cleared way to take a position in compliance carbon markets without giving up any of the impact or price discovery features. Below we will examine tracking, performance, and how futures are ultimately backed by physical allowances.\n\n\n\n\n#### Do futures provide the same experience as the underlying allowances?\n\n\n\n\nFutures contracts are fundamentally intertwined with their underlying markets and, in many cases, ARE the market in the underlying commodity or asset. This is even more true when the futures contract is physically settled, as is the case for carbon contracts. A physical settlement means that when the futures contract matures, the physical carbon allowances are transferred from sellers to buyers, ensuring that the futures contract price always converges with the price of the physical carbon allowance.\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of this mechanism, there is constant arbitrage, the trading of futures versus their underliers, to ensure efficient pricing between the futures contract, the carbon allowance auctions, and the secondary market in physical allowances. This means that the performance and volatility are consistent, and market mechanisms keep them aligned. As such, we strongly favor futures exposure for their liquidity and cost.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s prove this concept using the largest carbon market, the European Union Allowance (EUA) market. The EUA futures market traded $628.9 billion in volume in 2022 compared to a primary auction cap of approximately €136.1 billion ($149.1 billion) and a total number of allowances in circulation of €102.1 billion ($111.9 billion).4 Clearly, based on its substantially larger size, the futures market is the most robust source of liquidity and price discovery.\n\n\n\n\nThe European auctions happen several times per week, settling at a single price per day (US carbon markets have only four auctions per year), whereas the European carbon futures trade intraday each business day. Of course, this means the futures settlement price and auction price are not the same; however, due to the constant arbitrage/efficiency, the relationship holds tight day after day.\n\n\n\n\nTo further show the relationship in price, we charted the difference in daily returns between futures and physical contracts and calculated the 90-day rolling average. As shown in Figure 1, the average price difference is less than one basis point. In other words, the daily change in prices between futures and physical can differ on any given day but ultimately normalize to perfectly track over time.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_1.png)Figure 1\n\n\nAnother method of determining if future and physical price action is truly intertwined is by calculating correlation using historical pricing data. In Figure 2 below, you will see that the futures and physical markets are highly correlated, resulting in a positive correlation of 97%, meaning the price moves are almost exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_2.png)Figure 2\n\n\nSome investors assume that futures markets are more volatile than physical markets; however, this is not true. We observe essentially identical volatility of 45% using daily data and virtually the same using monthly data, with futures at 37% and physical auctions at 35%. \n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_3.png)Figure 3\n\n\nWe can even demonstrate that the much-discussed \"cost of carry\" or \"contango\", the shape of the futures curve that implies the cost of holding a position using a futures contract over time, does not create material drag on an unlevered investment in carbon futures. Figure 4 shows the price difference between auctions (\"spot\") and the forward price (\"futures\"). This demonstrates that the 90-day average \"premium\" that futures trade relative to auctions is less than both the 3-month and 1-year Treasury rates that we earn on the futures collateral. This means that the combined performance of the futures plus the collateral return creates an experience equivalent to holding the physical allowances, except with the liquidity of the exchange-traded vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_4.png)Figure 4\n\n\nNow that we have established that the futures and physical markets move in lockstep, we can illustrate why. It is intuitive because they are not two different markets but simply two elements of the same market. They are entirely interconnected as part of one liquidity ecosystem. The aggregate futures position is backed by a part of the physical \"bank,\" and the price of auctions is as much a signal to futures markets as the futures prices are a signal for auction prices. The futures are where the continuous market pricing is achieved, with auctions being periodic. We illustrate the interconnectivity of the carbon ecosystem below in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_5-1.png)Figure 5\n\n\nTo further hone in on their interconnectivity, we discuss how each futures position is backed by physical allowances in the market. It cannot be any other way. There are three scenarios of how our futures positions are backed, and all lead to the same outcome.\n\n\n\n\n2. We buy a future in the market, and a bank takes the other side. They are now short, and their only possible hedge is to buy physical allowances. Their business model is to sell futures slightly higher than the cost of hedging. If they decide to hedge with another future with somebody else, that “somebody” will have to cover with physicals. It doesn’t matter how long the daisy chain is. In the end, the position can only be hedged with physical. So, our long position is making the market net longer and therefore creating a long position in physical allowances at the market level.\n\n6. We buy a future in the market, and a natural hedger takes the other side. That is, an entity such as a power station or bank that is long physical allowances and wants to hedge its risk of a price decline. In this scenario, we have essentially assumed their physical position. They will hold the physical position against their short future that matches our long position. If they decide to use or sell their allowances, they will need to buy back their short futures, which will result in forcing someone else (like in example 1) to take on the long physical position.\n\n10. We buy the future in the market, and a naked short seller is on the other side. A naked short seller in this scenario is someone without a physical position or long exposure selling futures to bet on prices moving lower. In this example, which is less common, it might feel like no one is holding a physical allowance. However, the physics of financial markets ensures they are. Had we not been a long only buyer, the buyer would likely have been a bank or market maker who would then hedge by reducing their physical position. As such, our purchase of futures removed the need for physical allowances to be sold and therefore continue to back our long position.\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter which combinations of the three examples above are applied: our long positions all lead to an aggregated longer position in the actual underlying market. The same is also true of swaps, options, notes, ETFs, and any other derivative. Our KraneShares suite of carbon ETFs, for example, make the carbon allowance market longer an additional $900 million of carbon allowances.\n\n\n\n\n**Positive Impact of Investing in Carbon Futures**\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have covered how both physical and futures-based exposures have the same effect on the market, we can discuss how these long positions have a positive impact. Through both positions, investors help support price discovery and make markets increasingly tighter, making polluting more expensive and incentivizing the decarbonization of various economies, which is the very purpose of the cap-and-trade programs. This impact is powerful and at the heart of our thesis that we can create strong returns while also having a positive impact on our global environment and economy.\n\n\n\n\nSome suggest that holding a long position in carbon leads to the European program canceling additional allowances that permanently stop pollution. However, this is very much overplayed if not entirely incorrect. Holding a position does tighten markets, but it does not cancel them. The EUA cap and trade program does have a cancellation policy in place designed to reduce the number of allowances stored in the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) if the Total Number of Allowances in Circulation (TNAC) is too high. The MSR, for context, is a reserve that has been withdrawing huge numbers of allowances to tighten the market supply. It also has the potential to release those reserves in certain scenarios. The TNAC is simply the sum of allowances auctioned minus those retired. Why is this claim inaccurate? First, the allowances that can be canceled are in the MSR and have already been taken out of circulation and, therefore, not available to polluters. The permanent cancellation versus being locked in the MSR is only a marginal improvement. \n\n\n\n\nSecondly, an investor buying or selling allowances, in any form, does not change the TNAC. For example, if an investor sold their long position in allowances, it wouldn’t increase or reduce the TNAC. It would simply move them from one holder to another, albeit possibly at a lower price. It is the TNAC that determines whether allowances are canceled, so stating that holding physicals over futures has a greater impact is erroneous.\n\n\n\n\nAll of this said, there is no doubt that holding a long strategic position in allowances (again, physical or futures based) means that there are fewer allowances readily available to polluters, forcing these polluters to pay potentially higher prices to source allowances and further encouraging them to reduce their emissions even faster than the program designed.\n\n\n\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n\n\n\nWe've shown that futures and physical are two parts of the same market and create the same price discovery and impact. We take great pride in offering the largest, most liquid ETFs5 to millions of global investors to participate in one of the most effective tools we have against climate change while also providing the potential to generate strong returns.\n\n\n\n\nInvestors can gain access to carbon futures through our suite of carbon ETFs.

There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees. One cannot invest directly in an index.\n\n\nThis information should not be relied upon as research, investment advice, or a recommendation regarding any products, strategies, or any security in particular. This material is strictly for illustrative, educational, or informational purposes and is subject to change. Certain content represents an assessment of the market environment at a specific time and is not intended to be a forecast of future events or a guarantee of future results; material is as of the dates noted and is subject to change without notice.\n\n\n\nKRBN may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify KRBN’s gains or losses. A derivative (i.e., futures/forward contracts, swaps, and options) is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying asset. The primary risk of derivatives is that changes in the asset’s market value and the derivative may not be proportionate, and some derivatives can have the potential for unlimited losses. Derivatives are also subject to liquidity and counterparty risk. KRBN is subject to liquidity risk, meaning that certain investments may become difficult to purchase or sell at a reasonable time and price. If a transaction for these securities is large, it may not be possible to initiate, which may cause KRBN to suffer losses. Counterparty risk is the risk of loss in the event that the counterparty to an agreement fails to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the derivative.\n\n\n\n KRBN relies on the existence of cap and trade regimes. There is no assurance that cap and trade regimes will continue to exist, or that they will prove to be an effective method of reduction in GHG emissions. Changes in U.S. law and related regulations may impact the way KRBN operates, increase Fund costs and/or change the competitive landscape. New technologies may arise that may diminish or eliminate the need for cap and trade markets. Ultimately, the cost of emissions credits is determined by the cost of actually reducing emissions levels. If the price of credits becomes too high, it will be more economical for companies to develop or invest in green technologies, thereby suppressing the demand for credits. Fluctuations in currency of foreign countries may have an adverse effect to domestic currency values.\n\n The use of futures contracts is subject to special risk considerations. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts include: (a) an imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the reference asset and the price of the futures contract; (b) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired; (c) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which are potentially unlimited; (d) the inability to predict correctly the direction of market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and other economic factors; and (e) if KRBN has insufficient cash, it may have to sell securities or financial instruments from its portfolio to meet daily variation margin requirements, which may lead to KRBN selling securities or financial instruments at a loss.\n\n\nKRBN invests through a subsidiary, and is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiary’s investments. Since the Subsidiary is organized under the law of the Cayman Islands and is not registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as such KRBN will not receive all of the protections offered to shareholders of registered investment companies. KRBN and the Subsidiary will be considered commodity pools upon commencement of operations, and each will be subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC rules. Commodity pools are subject to additional laws, regulations and enforcement policies, which may increase compliance costs and may affect the operations and performance of KRBN and the Subsidiary. Futures and other contracts may have to be liquidated at disadvantageous times or prices to prevent KRBN from exceeding any applicable position limits established by the CFTC. The value of a commodity-linked derivative investment typically is based upon the price movements of a physical commodity and may be affected by changes in overall market movements, volatility of the Index, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity.\n\n\n\n\n KRBN is subject to interest rate risk, which is the chance that bonds will decline in value as interest rates rise.\n\n Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility. KRBN’s assets are expected to be concentrated in a sector, industry, market, or group of concentrations to the extent that the Underlying Index has such concentrations. The securities or futures in that concentration could react similarly to market developments. Thus, KRBN is subject to loss due to adverse occurrences that affect that concentration.\n KRBN is non-diversified.\n\n\nETF shares are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. However, shares may be redeemed at NAV directly by certain authorized broker-dealers (Authorized Participants) in very large creation/redemption units. The returns shown do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Beginning 12/23/2020, market price returns are based on the official closing price of an ETF share or, if the official closing price isn't available, the midpoint between the national best bid and national best offer (\"NBBO\") as of the time the ETF calculates the current NAV per share. Prior to that date, market price returns were based on the midpoint between the Bid and Ask price. NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time.\n\n\nThe KraneShares ETFs and KFA Funds ETFs are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Company (SIDCO), 1 Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA 19456, which is not affiliated with Krane Funds Advisors, LLC, the Investment Adviser for the Funds, or any sub-advisers for the Funds.\n\n\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://kraneshares.com/privacy-policy)\n\n\n[Whistleblower Policy](https://kraneshares.com/whistleblower-policy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are now leaving KraneShares.com\n===================================\n\n\nHyperlinks on this website are provided as a convenience and we disclaim any responsibility for information, services or products found on the websites linked hereto.\n\n\n[Click here to continue](#)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in KRBN Through Your Broker\n==================================\n\n\nYou are now leaving KraneShares.com.

The situation has led the company to replace the offsets in a contract with a corporate client and instead keep the stranded credits on its own books.\n\nHannah Hauman, global head of carbon trading at Trafigura — and a former oil trader — says the complete loss of value seen in some corners of the voluntary carbon market is unlike anything she’s witnessed in oil markets.\n\nOil traders “see distressed or off-spec cargoes,” but they “don’t see defunct assets,” she said in an interview.\n\nIt’s the latest in a string of cases in which traders handling carbon credits are having to treat such assets as stranded. Just over 75 million carbon credits currently lie dormant on the accounts of Vitol SA, the world’s largest independent commodity trader. And Dutch trader ACT Commodities Group BV and ACT Financial Solutions, which are both units of SMS Holding BV, last year wrote off about 1.5 million credits.\n\nSince the first carbon credit was traded roughly 35 years ago, the market has been hit by a steady stream of scandals that have led to wild price swings and even collapsing valuations. That has implications not just for firms trading such credits, but also for companies that use them to underpin green claims to customers and regulators.\n\nA carbon credit is a paper security representing one ton of CO2 reduced or removed from the atmosphere, generated by projects like wind farms or planting trees. Buyers can trade the units or use them to offset their own emissions, in which case they must retire the credit to avoid it being used twice.\n\nStory continuesBut independent scientific analysis of a project’s CO2 reduction claims often lags behind the issuance of the corresponding carbon credits, leaving buyers in the $2 billion market exposed to losses.\n\nUnlike its regulated equivalent in the compliance market, the voluntary carbon market lacks oversight, and buyers can find that promises made by sellers don’t always hold true.\n\nTrafigura recently purchased credits from the Southern Cardamom forestry project in Cambodia and had a contract to sell these to a large retailer. In June, carbon credit certification body Verra halted issuances from the project, pending an investigation into “stakeholder comments.” The allegations surrounding the project led Trafigura to offer its client the option to switch to different credits, which it accepted. That left Trafigura with the units suspended on its books.\n\nAnd at least one company has written off credits tied to a forestry project in Zimbabwe called Kariba, after discovering that too many had been issued relative to the emissions reductions actually achieved, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive information.\n\nAccording to Hauman, such problems have led buyers to seek closer contact with offset projects, to keep a closer eye on how they’re run. But that’s actually adding to the risk of getting lumped with defunct credits, as buyers focus on fewer projects and lock into longer-term contracts, she said.\n\n“Customers are wanting to get increasingly close to their projects, and the only way to get close and to have that forward steady stream of procurement is to go for more term off-takes,” Hauman said, referring to long-term contracts for future supply, as opposed to a one-off spot transaction.\n\nThat means “these transactions have a lot of capital at risk,” she said.\n\nVitol and ACT’s stranded offsets are known as emissions reduction units (ERUs). These were first issued under an old United Nations program that’s since faced heavy criticism, with roughly 75% of the units issued now thought to be useless.\n\nThe 75 million credits stranded on Vitol’s books are equivalent to one third of last year’s global issuance, or twice Switzerland’s annual CO2 emissions. A spokesperson for Vitol said the company doesn’t intend to trade or retire any ERUs it holds, and that these were written down to zero years ago. ACT told Bloomberg it “destroyed” about 1.5 million ERUs last year after realizing they were valueless.\n\nStill, there’s a market for junk carbon credits as sellers find new buyers and distributors. A client of ACT retired 750,000 ERUs last year, ostensibly to claim emissions had been offset. When Verra and Gold Standard, the world’s leading offset registries, issued restrictions on some renewable energy offsets, a new registry opened in Qatar to absorb that supply.\n\nPrices in the voluntary carbon market vary wildly, with factors such as the age and location of a project affecting the perceived value. ERUs once traded at close to $20 per unit, but then crashed to roughly $2 in 2012 and a only few cents shortly thereafter. Credits from the Southern Cardamom and Kariba projects sold for about $10 last year, according to broker data compiled by BloombergNEF.\n\nHauman says buyers of credits should be reassured by new standards such as those set by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market’s Core Carbon Principles, as well as the UN’s new Article 6 market, particularly where those units come with an accounting adjustment to ensure they aren’t used more than once.\n\n“We urgently need to make it easy for investors to recognize and price a high-integrity carbon credit,” Annette Nazareth, chair of the ICVCM, said in a statement. “That is what our CCP label is designed to do.”\n\nHauman says the trend now is that “instead of ‘buyer beware,’ really the onus is on the seller to deliver quality as per those specifications. That’s extremely important for buyer confidence.”\n\nMark Lewis, head of climate research at commodities focused hedge-fund manager Andurand Capital Management, says the UN’s Article 6 system “gives credibility to credits outside compliance schemes” like the EU Emissions Trading System.\n\nBut, he said “the risk is definitely there for credits that don’t have that quasi-compliance status.”\n\nLewis expects the offsets market to eventually split in two.\n\n“There’s going be a market of credits with a very high value because they have quasi-compliance status, and there’s going be a market that doesn’t,” he said.\n\n(Adds comment from ICVCM in sixth-to-last paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n* [Sorry, But LinkedIn Is Cool

\n\n\n **How EU Banks Show Resilience in Stress Tests** \n\n\nEuropean banks are poised to handle more challenging conditions, including a global recession, persistent inflation and rising interest rates. \n\n\nResults of the latest stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank underscore the banking industry's overall resilience to a severe deterioration in asset quality and market shocks, with participants faring better under tougher assumptions than in the 2021 exercise, according to an [S&P Global Ratings report](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/230801-eu-banks-resist-tough-assumptions-in-latest-stress-tests-12810316). Following the same approach and using the same baseline and adverse scenarios, the EBA's stress test covered 70 banks from 16 EU and European Economic Area countries, representing approximately 75% of the EU's banking assets. The European Central Bank's test covered another 41 institutions. \n\n\nUnder an adverse scenario, the [EBA stress test](https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-publishes-results-its-2023-eu-wide-stress-test) showed that banks' aggregate common equity Tier 1 capital ratio — which compares capital against assets — would drop 459 basis points to 10.4% in 2025 from 15.0% at the end of 2022.\n\n\nAccording to S&P Global Ratings, these results are \"broadly similar\" to those of the 2021 exercise, despite much harsher conditions, including a severe global recession, higher-for-longer inflation, increasing interest rates, and higher credit spreads and unemployment. \n\n\nRocio Falcones, senior director at consultancy Alvarez & Marsal, attributed banks' \"very good resilience\" to improved credit quality since the previous stress test and higher net interest income, according to an [S&P Global Market Intelligence report](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/eba-stress-tests-banks-capital-strong-dividend-plans-on-track-analysts-say-76779754).\n\n\nThe EBA pointed to the increase in credit risk losses as the main negative contributor to common equity Tier 1 ratios, with exposures to corporates and small and medium-sized enterprises accounting for most credit losses. On a sectoral level, exposures to the hospitality and construction industries are the [biggest threat to asset quality](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/eba-stress-tests-hospitality-construction-pose-biggest-credit-risk-to-banks-76780473), leading to the highest loss rates in the adverse scenario.\n\n\nThe impact from credit risk, however, is lower than in the 2021 stress test, mitigated by banks' having better asset quality at the start of the 2023 exercise and higher provision overlays, according to the EBA.\n\n\nThe stress test results are largely in line with S&P Global Ratings' view that [capital buffers and higher profits](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/230123-european-banks-resilient-and-divergent-as-the-economic-reset-kicks-in-12612260) have boosted the resilience of European banks.\n\n\nIn a January report, the rating agency's expectation was that European banks will continue to be \"comfortably profitable\" if they can learn to deal with an economic environment that includes higher-for-longer inflation, tighter funding conditions and lower economic growth. While risks could emerge, the sector will \"prove resilient and a source of stability for the economy\" thanks to banks’ strong capitalization and liquidity levels.\n\n\nOn asset quality, S&P Global Ratings expects only a [moderate deterioration](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/230420-european-banks-asset-quality-tougher-times-ahead-require-extra-caution-12699186) in 2023.\n\n\nToday is **Monday, August 21, 2023**, and here is today’s essential intelligence.\n\n\n*Written by *Jasmine Castroverde*.*\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n#### Economy\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**India's Economy Continues To Show Strong Growth In Mid-2023**\n\n\n![](/_division_assets/images/articles/daily-update-august-21-2023/economy_aug21.png)\n\n\nAfter rapid economic growth of 7.2% in the 2022-23 fiscal year, economic momentum has remained strong in the first half of 2023.

These credits operate within the framework of international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, thriving within carbon markets where projects designed to curtail emissions yield tradeable credits. These credits, in turn, can be purchased by entities seeking to offset their own emissions, thereby showcasing their unwavering commitment to fostering sustainability. The proportion of global annual greenhouse gas emissions covered by carbon credits has risen from 5% in 2005 to 22% in 2022.\n\n![](https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/08/F1-600x321.png)\n\nHowever, the attainment of carbon credits is a formidable achievement, as projects undergo rigorous evaluation by impartial auditors to ensure strict adherence to established standards. Upon successful verification, these credits are introduced into various markets, effectively directing investments toward emission reduction initiatives and sustainable undertakings, particularly within developing nations.\n\nBeyond their symbolic significance, these credits carry tangible benefits, acting as a catalyst in propelling the global transition towards a low-carbon future. By attaching quantifiable value to emission reductions, they serve to invigorate international collaboration in the ongoing battle against climate change. The adoption and incorporation of carbon credits into our practices signify an inspiring journey towards safeguarding our planet and embracing an eco-friendly, sustainable tomorrow.\n\nThe popularity of the credits could be estimated by the fact that India alone has a market share of 17% globally with 35.94 million USD currently (the global market stands at 2 billion). By some estimates, the global carbon credits market would reach 100 billion USD by the end of 2030 as per Confederation of Indian Industry. It has also been estimated by MarketsAndMarkets that global market size would reach 1,602 billion $.\n\n![](https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/08/F2-600x281.png)\n\nHow does the system work?\n-------------------------\n\nThe world of carbon credits thrives under international climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, incentivising greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Diverse emission reduction projects, from renewable energy to waste management, undergo rigorous validation to ensure authenticity. Once verified, carbon credits are issued based on reduced CO2e emissions.\n\nThese credits take centre stage in carbon markets, where they can be traded voluntarily or for compliance purposes.\n\nRevenue generated from credit sales supports sustainable development and further investment in emission reduction projects. The market dynamics influence carbon credit prices, while their co-benefits include job creation, improved air quality, and advancements toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This captivating symphony of carbon credits urges humanity toward a brighter, more sustainable future.\n\nThe Indian context of carbon credits\n------------------------------------\n\nIn India, the carbon credit system operates primarily under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The process of carbon credit generation and trading follows a structured flow, adhering to guidelines set by relevant regulatory bodies. The journey begins with Project Identification and Development, where projects contributing to GHG emission reduction are selected. These encompass renewable energy projects, energy efficiency improvements, and waste management schemes, aligning with CDM and regulatory criteria.\n\nThe Project Design Document (PDD) is pivotal, outlining the project’s objectives, methodologies, baseline emissions, additionality assessment, and emissions reductions. Validation and Verification are critical turning points, with designated Operational Entities (DOEs) conducting independent assessments and rewarding projects that meet criteria with validation reports. Implementation and Monitoring are essential, with robust systems ensuring accurate emission reduction reporting. Verification and Certification culminate in Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) issuance based on verified emission reductions.\n\nCarbon Credit Trading showcases CERs’ value, drawing entities to offset emissions or meet regulatory commitments. Retirement or Surrender of CERs concludes the journey, ensuring the integrity of emissions accounting. The effectiveness of the system is amplified by the Types of Projects Allowed Under the Carbon Credits Scheme, including Renewable Energy Projects, Energy Efficiency Projects, Waste Management Projects, and Afforestation Projects.\n\nIndian authorities governing carbon credits play a vital role. The Designated National Authority (DNA) endorses projects and provides approval. The CDM Executive Board oversees global projects, ensuring compliance and issuing CERs. Accredited Operational Entities (AOEs) validate and verify projects, while the National CDM Authority coordinates projects within India, offering guidance and support.\n\nWhile the carbon credit market in India is still in its early stages, it is growing rapidly. As of now, several players issue carbon credits in India:\n\n• The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI): This think tank has issued over 3 million carbon credits from its projects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors.  \n • The World Resources Institute (WRI): This non-profit organization has issued over 2 million carbon credits from its projects in the forestry sector.\n\nThe carbon credits that these entities have issued can be traded on a variety of exchanges, including the Chicago Climate Exchange, the European Climate Exchange, and the Intercontinental Exchange. Some of the trading places for carbon credits in India are:  \n • National Stock Exchange (NSE): The NSE launched a carbon trading platform in 2017.\n\n• Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE): The BSE launched a carbon trading platform in 2018.\n\n• Power Exchange India (PXIL): The PXIL launched a carbon trading platform in 2020.\n\nAs more and more companies and organisations look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, the demand for carbon credits is expected to increase.\n\nGlobal context of carbon credits\n--------------------------------\n\nIn the fight against climate change, carbon credits play a significant role in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. The process starts with Project Identification and Development, where projects for emissions reduction are chosen, adhering to country-specific guidelines.\n\nA crucial step involves preparing a comprehensive Project Design Document (PDD) outlining project objectives, methodologies, baseline emissions, additionality assessment, and anticipated reductions. Validation and Verification by accredited Operational Entities (DOEs) ensure compliance and project eligibility. Following approval, projects implement and monitor activities, reporting emissions reductions accurately. Verification and Certification by thirdparty verifiers lead to the issuance of carbon credits, held in central registries.\n\nCarbon Credit Trading allows developers to trade credits in carbon markets, enabling entities to offset emissions.\n\nRetirement or Surrender of Carbon Credits demonstrates compliance with reduction commitments, ensuring emissions accounting integrity. Regulatory bodies like the EPA (US), BEIS (UK), European Commission, and CER (Australia) oversee carbon credit programs. A variety of projects, from renewable energy to afforestation, contribute to global emissions reduction efforts.\n\nCollectively, these countries incentivize emissions reductions, promoting sustainability for a low-carbon future. Carbon credits prove a powerful tool in combating climate change, inspiring global commitment to environmental preservation. Carbon Pricing Mechanisms have seen a monumental rise since its advent in 1990 as can be seen in figure 2 as per World Bank which clearly shows that companies around the world has embraced carbon credits.\n\n![](https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/08/F3-600x321.png)\n\nHow does India march ahead of global counterparts\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Indian carbon credit system, operating under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), stands ahead in several aspects:\n\n1. Extensive Use of CDM: India actively utilizes the CDM framework, registering numerous emission reduction projects. Leading in CDM project registrations reflects its proactive stance in adopting clean technologies and attracting international investments.\n\n2. Emphasis on Sustainable Development: India’s system prioritises sustainable development co-benefits. Projects generating carbon credits must showcase positive impacts on social, economic, and environmental aspects, aligning emission reductions with broader development goals.\n\n3. Inclusion of Diverse Project Types: India’s system covers a wide range of projects, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste management, and afforestation. This comprehensive approach ensures emissions reduction across sectors.\n\n4. National CDM Authority: India has a dedicated authority facilitating and coordinating CDM projects. It streamlines processes, provides guidance, and enhances efficiency.\n\n5. Integration of Policies and Incentives: India implements policies like feed-in tariffs and renewable purchase obligations, creating a favourable environment for renewable energy projects and incentivizing emission reductions, fostering the carbon credit market’s growth.\n\nThe current regulation and way forward\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), outlined in the draft by the Ministry of Power, stands as a pivotal force shaping India’s regulatory framework concerning carbon credits. A significant stride in this direction was taken through the introduction of the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill in 2022, which established the groundwork for the forthcoming Indian carbon credit market. The draft blueprint envisions the establishment of the India Carbon Market Governing Board (ICMGB) as the central entity responsible for the oversight and regulation of the carbon credit market.\n\nThis board boasts representation from critical ministries including Environment, Forest, and Climate Change; Power; Finance; New and Renewable Energy; Steel; and Coal. The multifaceted responsibilities of the ICMGB encompass policy formulation, regulatory framework establishment, and trading criteria definition for carbon credit certificates.\n\nPlaying a key role within this framework, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) assumes the roles of both the ICM Administrator and Secretariat for the ICMGB. The BEE will be entrusted with devising protocols and processes for project registration under the voluntary mechanism, devising trajectories and objectives for entities operating within the compliance mechanism, as well as the issuance of carbon credit certificates. Additionally, the Bureau will be instrumental in crafting mechanisms to ensure market stability, alongside delineating procedures for Accredited Carbon Verifiers.\n\nThe role of the ICM Registry, tasked with maintaining meticulous transaction records and establishing links with other registries, falls under the purview of the Grid Controller of India Limited. Overseeing trading activities and safeguarding the interests of both sellers and buyers, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) is designated as the ICM Trading Regulator. The draft underscores the significance of the compliance mechanism, which obligates entities to curtail GHG emission intensity in adherence to established norms. Complementing this is the envisioned voluntary mechanism, designed for non-obligated entities to enrol on projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions and thereby acquiring carbon credit certificates.\n\nIndia’s approach gained traction subsequent to COP26, marked by the identification of 12 GHG mitigation activities eligible for trading within the ambit of the Paris Agreement’s Article 6.2 mechanism. This endeavour is oriented towards the creation of a robust domestic market that bridges financial gaps concerning the nation’s ongoing energy transition. Through these initiatives, India showcases a steadfast commitment to the decarbonization of its economy and the fostering of sustainable development in the collective mission to combat climate change.\n\n \n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own, and do not necessarily reflect those held by **pv magazine**.\n\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

Regulation (EU) 2023/1642, which amends Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1122 with the aim of modernizing the functioning of the Union Registry in the context of the European Union's emissions trading system (EU ETS) and, with a focus on ensuring the accuracy, security, and efficiency of the Union Registry's operations.\n\nThe Union Registry plays a crucial role in managing the trading of greenhouse gas emission allowances within the EU. The initial system, introduced in 2005, ensured accurate tracking of greenhouse gas emission allowances issued under the EU ETS.

Just this summer New Yorkers have been confronted with new, more deadly and debilitating climate emergencies, from the severe flooding in the Hudson Valley to the thick, choking wildfire smoke from Canada causing an increase in respiratory issues and [asthma-related ER visits](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14062023/new-york-er-asthma-willdfire-smoke/), [disproportionately in low-income, predominantly Black and Hispanic communities](https://gothamist.com/news/asthma-er-visits-during-nyc-smoke-haze-were-highest-in-high-poverty-black-and-latino-areas).\n\nIn the coming months, Gov. Hochul will roll out her administration’s proposal for a “cap-trade-and-invest” (CT&I) program, an economy-wide, sector-based program intended to help New York lower its emissions and meet the targets in New York’s ambitious climate law, the [Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA)](https://climate.ny.gov/Resources/Scoping-Plan). This new program would set an annual limit, or a cap, on New York’s greenhouse gas emissions and create permits that businesses could purchase, allowing them to pay to emit an amount of emissions up to the cap.\n\nWe urge the Hochul administration to adopt guardrails to minimize costs, maximize benefits, encourage early action, undo legacy pollution, and protect frontline communities disproportionately impacted by climate injustice from increased emissions and pollution hotspots.\n\nIt is crucial that state regulators build a just system prioritizing low-income communities and communities of color over polluters. Any program must comply with the CLCPA’s mandate to prioritize the reduction of emissions and co-pollutants in disadvantaged communities. We can’t let CT&I be a distraction from direct emission reductions and climate investments, such as ending our reliance on fossil fuels and decarbonizing our homes and buildings. Cap-and-trade systems do not guarantee emissions reduction, and CT&I alone will not undo the legacy air pollution that has sickened environmental justice communities across the state.\n\nTOP POLITICS VIDEOSMuch to the alarm of environmental justice advocates, the Hochul administration has proposed using a form of emissions trading. The ability to trade means that polluters that do not use all their emissions allowances under their cap can sell the remainder to other polluters who want to emit more than their cap. Done wrong, New York’s cap program could risk making mistakes similar to those California made with its version of the program, where emissions have actually increased in certain sectors.\n\nRecent research on cap-and-trade programs shows a general pattern in which low-income communities and communities of color received improvements and [emissions reductions at a lower and slower rate for all pollutants when compared to wealthier, white communities.](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/1411/docs/CAP_and_TRADE_Updated_2020_v02152022_FINAL.pdf) To avoid this outcome in New York, it’s imperative that a just cap-and-invest program refrain from the use of trading, offsets, and unlimited banking, which are key components of the California program.\n\n“Cap and invest” regulations must prohibit allowance trading that could potentially exacerbate pollution in already overburdened communities and impose facility-specific and sector-based caps. Specific caps can be designated for facilities or sectors to ensure the state meets its CLCPA targets. For example, each power plant could have a cap on how much it can emit, with the cap amount decreasing to zero over time to meet the zero-emissions by 2040 mandate for the power sector. These specific caps would help prevent the inequitable distribution of air quality benefits from emissions reductions and ensure all facilities in disadvantaged communities decrease emissions as fast as the statewide average amount.\n\nDone right, an emissions cap program would make corporate polluters pay for their toxic pollution, raising billions of dollars to create good, green union jobs, and directing money to Black, Brown, Indigenous, and working-class communities. The program could also lower energy costs across the board for all New Yorkers. Reducing emissions and subsequent pollution would lower rates of asthma, heart disease, and stroke and increase New Yorkers’ life expectancy. This means New Yorkers could lead longer, healthier lives with lower prescription drug costs and medical bills.\n\nA CT&I program alone will not position New York to meet its CLCPA targets and, if done in isolation without guardrails, could deepen the impacts of environmental racism. It’s incumbent on the state Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to listen to the voices of all New Yorkers in order to equitably design and implement New York’s ambitious climate legislation.\n\nA program that includes trading, but doesn’t prioritize the health and well being of those who have faced the brunt of the climate crisis, isn’t the kind of program New York needs or deserves. We call on decision makers in Albany to ensure that in implementing New York’s landmark climate law, they center environmental justice and equity at every stage of the planning process.\n\n*González-Rojas represents parts of Queens in the state Assembly.

Poorer countries have a lower threshold – Bulgaria, for example, has to cut emissions by 10%.\n\n\nAs both the buildings and transport sectors in Germany are expected to miss their climate targets significantly, a gap of 150 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent gases relative to the ESR targets is expected. If this is the case, Germany will have to purchase allowances from other countries to make up the shortfall, at prices as yet unknown.\n\n\n\n![](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/Effort-sharing-trialogue_edited-800x600.jpg)\n\n#### [EU strikes deal on climate 'effort sharing' regulation](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-strikes-deal-on-climate-effort-sharing-regulation/)\n\n\nEuropean Union negotiators reached an agreement Tuesday evening (8 November) on a regulation mandating emission cuts across sectors such as buildings, road transport, agriculture and waste.\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of carbon\n------------------\n\n\n“We not only have national obligations, but also European commitments,” explained Brigitte Knopf, vice-chair of the German climate expert panel, on Tuesday (22 August). Those commitments were seemingly ignored by Berlin during the revision of its climate law, she added.\n\n\nIn the spring, Germany decided to abolish individual sector climate targets, instead opting for a whole-system approach. Despite public statements by senior government officials that overall climate targets will be reached, a significant overspill of more than 200 million tonnes by 2030 is expected, the experts of the climate panel found.\n\n\nWhile that may spell legal trouble for Berlin, the financial implications of failing to cut back on CO2-equivalent emissions are likely to come at a price, too. \n\n\nIn 2022, Germany was forced to purchase 11 million carbon certificates from Bulgaria, Czechia and Hungary for the period of 2013 to 2020 – these came relatively cheaply due to their abundance at the time as most countries had a surplus. \n\n\nHowever, for the period of 2021 to 2027, the gap between Germany’s target and real emissions is likely to be 15 times larger. Meanwhile, as the targets are becoming more ambitious for all countries as part of the EU’s ‘Fit for 55’ climate package, fewer countries are likely to have significant leftover emission allowances.\n\n\n“The price for emission allowances under the EU Climate Change Regulation is basically still completely uncertain,” says Jakob Graichen, a senior expert at the German Öko Institute. \n\n\nHowever, it is to be expected that the price will be based on the upcoming EU emissions trading scheme for buildings and transport, which, according to the expert, would then be prices of “more than €50 per emission allowance, possibly even several hundred euros”.\n\n\nAt a gap of 150 million allowances, the penalty for missing the effort-sharing targets could be hefty: upwards of €7.5 billion at the very least, although €30 billion could easily be reached.\n\n\nUltimately, though, prices for allowances are a consequence of bilateral negotiations between EU countries – for instance, Bulgaria could offer its allowances to Germany on the cheap, once more.\n\n\nWhat would happen should Germany be unable to procure sufficient quantities of emission allowances, as other EU countries are unlikely to significantly overachieve their targets – leaving little remaining? \n\n\n“That is precisely the big question. Nobody knows for sure,” stressed Knopf. By late October, the European Environmental Agency is expected to publish more concrete analyses of EU countries’ ability to meet their effort-sharing goals.  \n\n\n\n\n*[Edited by Nathalie Weatherald]*\n\n\n### Read more with EURACTIV\n\n![New EU carbon tariff: German industry slams bureaucratic burden](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_79613116-150x150.jpg)\n\n#### [New EU carbon tariff: German industry slams bureaucratic burden](https://www.euractiv.com/?post_type=news&p=1966075)\n\nGermany’s chemical and car industries are protesting the anticipated bureaucratic strain expected from the phase-in of the EU’s novel carbon border tariff (CBAM), while consultancy Deloitte finds that companies have failed to sufficiently prepare.","summaries":null,"semantic_commentary":null,"sentiment_score":null,"classifications":null}]}
