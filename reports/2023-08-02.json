The massive Bootleg Fire destroyed trees in the Klamath Basin, including portions of two carbon offset projects covering 570,000 acres and operated by Green Diamond.\n\n*Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPB*\n\nThis was supposed to be a showcase for Seattle-based Green Diamond\u2019s forestry strategy for a warming world. The company had committed to century-long plans to slow the pace of logging on some 570,000 acres. In exchange, the company received millions of dollars in payments from Microsoft and other companies seeking to offset their carbon dioxide pollution from fossil fuels by paying to grow more wood on this land.\n\nAs temperatures rise due to the buildup of greenhouse gas pollution, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere has emerged as a key part of the broader battle to limit the effects of climate change by shifting away from fossil fuels. Some of that may be done by new technologies now under development that can take carbon dioxide out of the air and put it in long-term storage. Yet, so far, almost all of that removal has come from forest or other land-based projects, according to a global assessment released earlier this year by scientists who concluded these efforts must greatly expand to keep global temperatures from rising more the 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2014 which is the increase nations agreed to try not to exceed in the [2015 Paris climate agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement).\n\nThe Bootleg Fire upended the Green Diamond carbon storage plans in Southern Oregon. In burning through nearly 20% of the company\u2019s Klamath project lands, it also has helped to stoke a broader debate about the ability of multibillion-dollar forestry offset markets to deliver the carbon savings that are supposed to happen from these deals.\n\nEarlier this year, Green Diamond filed documents with a California state regulatory board that calls for an offset project covering most of the company\u2019s Southern Oregon acreage to be \u201cterminated.\u201d\n\n**The Bootleg Fire\u2019s toll on Green Diamond carbon offset projects**\n\n![Map showing the extent of Green Diamond carbon offset areas east of Klamath Falls overlayed with the final extent of the 2021 Bootleg Fire.](https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/sB-dx777f_-gOlCx9ms1wU5qEyo=/150x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/opb/EFA45ZK46VGKBOCFPLBB4Y76YI.jpg)The 2021 Bootleg Fire burned through more than 100,000 acres of Green Diamond timber lands that were in a Southern Oregon carbon offset project.\n\n*MacGregor Campbell / OPB*\n\nThe project depended on live trees. Year after year, they would act like worker bees, collecting carbon dioxide and \u2014 with the aid of the sunlight and water \u2014 use photosynthesis to store more of it in their wood.\n\nDuring the fire, Green Diamond lost live trees that stored some 3.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. That is equivalent to the greenhouse gases produced through the course of a year by more than 700,000 cars driving 11,500 miles.\n\nA small portion of Green Diamond\u2019s lost carbon went directly into the atmosphere through combustion as the fire swept through the forest. The vast majority now resides in dead trees. They will eventually release this carbon as they topple to the ground and begin the decadeslong process of decay, or perhaps more quickly should another fire sweep through this land.\n\nFires also have caused big losses in two other Pacific Northwest forest tracts that had been used to offset fossil fuel pollution. In Northeast Washington, wildfires have repeatedly buffeted a large carbon offset project on the lands of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. In Central Oregon, the Lionshead Fire torched most of the acreage of a carbon offset project developed by the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. That project \u2014 like Green Diamond\u2019s \u2014 is likely to be terminated.\n\n![A charred tree on one of Green Diamond\u2019s Klamath Basin properties, June 29, 2023.

He forged a powerful timber industry player that joined in the early logging of Northwest old growth forests and \u2014 as technology developed \u2014 clear-cutting that eventually expanded to California\u2019s coastal redwoods, where the company clashed with conservationists seeking to protect more forests.\n\n\u201cSome serious scientists are part of the Environmental Movement, but many of the serious concerns about global warming, ozone depletion, unsustainable industrialization, and resource depletion or devastation are based on pseudoscience or no science at all \u2014 just wildly exaggerated claims,\u201d said then-Simpson Timber Company vice president John Walker, in an Oct. 1, 1990, University of California, Berkeley, [lecture](https://nature.berkeley.edu/sjhall/1990) that marked the 100th anniversary of the company\u2019s founding.\n\n![A small ponderosa pine seedling, June 29, 2023, planted in the spring of 2022 on Green Diamond land in the Klamath Basin.

Within the past decade, Green Diamond has put together forest [carbon projects](https://www.greendiamond.com/businesses/natural-climate-solutions) covering 751,000 of its 2.2 million acres, and is developing more in Montana.\n\nIn July 2022 [testimony](https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/reed_testimony_package.pdf) to the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, Reed called working forests \u201ca critical natural climate solution,\u201d and said sustainably managed working forests, along with the wood products they produce, represent \u201cone of our nation\u2019s greatest assets for achieving our climate goals.\u201d\n\nThe Green Diamond projects, as well as most other U.S. forest carbon projects, have been formed under [the rules](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/compliance-offset-program) developed by the California Air Resources Board, which regulates a state program that puts a cap on greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than pay for pollution allowances, the board offers major emitters the chance to offset a small portion of their greenhouse gases through investments in forestry projects. As of last fall, 149 of these projects have been approved on 5.5 million acres spread across 29 states.\n\nWashington state established a similar forestry offset program in the aftermath of 2021 legislation that put a price in carbon pollution while Oregon has yet to enact such a law.\n\nMeanwhile, many corporations, such as Microsoft, invest in forestry projects to help meet their own goals for reducing carbon emissions, and that has helped to boost demand for carbon credits.\n\nGreen Diamond first moved into the carbon offset market on some Klamath Basin acres acquired in 2014. All of this land had been heavily logged for decades by a succession of owners.\n\nSome had been cleared of timber, then replanted. Other acreage was selectively cut to remove the biggest, most valuable timber.\n\nWhen Green Diamond acquired the land, most of the regrowth was still too small to profitably harvest. Many trees were spindly and crowded together, competing for scarce moisture in a forest landscape radically altered by the earlier harvests.\n\nThe logging legacy also left behind a massive amount of unmerchantable timber heaped in piles scattered across thousands of acres alongside the road network. These were deemed a fire hazard and targeted for burning as Green Diamond acquired ownership.\n\n![](https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/-Ru7RandrBTNhJHpr8MrtaSgPmI=/150x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/opb/KIMV7QIPFFGM5OYVQ7ZLPBPKFE.jpg)In this Google Earth image from July 2021, light-colored rectangles indicate slash piles left behind by decades of logging by previous land owners.

Critics say they are no substitute for reducing global dependence on coal, natural gas and oil, and may often fail to provide the carbon savings needed to offset fossil fuel emissions.\n\nOne of the most scathing assessments has come from an industry insider: Jim Hourdequin, chief executive of Lyme Timber, whose own company has put together forestry carbon deals.\n\n\u201cOur assessment is that many forest carbon offset projects in the U.S. have probably delivered relatively little carbon storage and climate benefit,\u201d Hourdequin said in an [October 2022](https://yff.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/2022-09-08%20Hourdequin%20World%20BioEconomy%20Keynote%20(with%20slides).pdf) talk to the Yale Forest Forum.\n\n\u201cWhile our commercial forests do store a lot of carbon \u2026 these climate benefits are likely to be realized whether or not the property is enrolled in a carbon offset project.\u201d\n\nThat often amounts, he maintains, to paying landowners to \u201cnot do what they were not going to do.\u201d\n\nIn Oregon, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs gained California certification to market carbon credits from a 24,000-acre roadless tract of land that the tribe had traditionally not chosen to harvest and was not part of its commercial timber base.\n\n\u201cThese were areas that were set aside for ecological reasons, cultural reasons,\u201d said Vollmer, the tribal forester.\n\nYet because the tribes had the legal right to harvest this timber, the land could still qualify for credits, some of which were used by Chevron U.S.A. and Tesoro Refining and Marketing to offset fossil fuel emissions in California, according to a review of documents filed with the California board.\n\nSkepticism about carbon forest storage projects also has been voiced by some investors.\n\nMicrosoft is buying offset credits as part of a push to make the corporation \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030 and intends to \u201cultimately remove\u201d the corporation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution footprint. A Microsoft executive once responsible for investing in forest projects, Elizabeth Willmott, reported that the company received 189 proposals to remove 154 million metric tons of carbon, mostly through trees.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:[Become a Sponsor](https://www.opb.org/sponsorship/)Just 2 million tons\u2019 worth of projects passed corporate review.\n\n\u201cToday, there\u2019s simply not a lot of really secure forest carbon projects,\u201d Willmott said in a [2022 interview](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/forests-as-carbon-offsets-climate-change-has-other-plans) with National Geographic. \u201cWe see a problem with that across the U.S. and across the world.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft, in a statement, said Green Diamond projects met Microsoft standards for \u201chigh-quality carbon removal.\u201d The corporation declined a request to make Willmott available for an OPB interview, according to a spokesperson, because she had moved on to a new corporate position.\n\n\n> \u201cFor that balancing act of pollution and offsetting to really equal out for us \u2026. we need to match the duration of the storage of CO2 with the duration of how long it stays in the atmosphere.\u201d\n> \n> \n\nSome researchers also cite what they view as a more fundamental flaw in using forests to offset fossil fuel emissions. Under the California board rules, the projects commit to store carbon dioxide for at least a century, yet the greenhouse gasses released by the combustion of oil, gas and coal may linger in the atmosphere for 1,000 years or more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really, really big mismatch,\u201d said Grayson Badgley, a forest ecologist with [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org/), a California-based nonprofit that watchdogs the state\u2019s forestry offset program. \u201cFor that balancing act of pollution and offsetting to really equal out for us \u2026. we need to match the duration of the storage of CO2 with the duration of how long it stays in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nCalifornia regulators acknowledge the possibility that carbon storage projects will be undermined by wildfires, disease or financial stresses that prompt a landowner to abandon a plan and increase logging.\n\nTo deal with this risk, the state regulatory board requires landowners to refrain from selling some of their carbon credits. Instead, they dedicate them to a kind of insurance policy called the buffer pool. If wildfires or disease kill lots of trees and undermine a project, or financial stresses prompt a landowner to abandon the plan and step up logging, the insurance pool can be drawn down to cover the losses.\n\nThe buffer pool, as it pays out credits, enables purchasers of carbon offsets to say they are still meeting their climate goals. It also reduces risks for developers like Green Diamond, because they can potentially retain all the revenue from selling carbon even when a project is terminated.\n\nThe California state buffer pool currently has some 31 million credits, including nearly 6 million credits that were put in to cover fire risks. Already, the carbon losses from fires on six Western projects are expected to exceed 7 million credits, according to reporting documents filed by project developers that were reviewed by Badgley, of CarbonPlan.\n\nThe biggest hits to date on the buffer pool will come from the more than 3.7 million in wildfire carbon credit losses reported by the Colville Tribes in northeast Washington state, according to documents filed by the tribe.\n\nThe tribe fashioned one of the most ambitious forestry projects yet. It encompasses more than 500,000 acres of heavily timbered lands that had lots of stored carbon. By pledging to keep the logging well below a maximum yield scenario, the project generated more than 12 million in carbon credits, all of which were purchased by BP.\n\nThe selling price was undisclosed, but at market prices in recent years, the credits would have generated more than $120 million. The money went into a tribal investment account that funds projects like construction of drug treatment and health clinics, said Cody Desautel, the Colville\u2019s executive director who helped develop the project.\n\nAs the project was being put together in 2015, one big wildfire raged on Colville lands, prompting a reshuffling of the boundaries. That fire and subsequent blazes have burned across half of the tribal lands during a six-year period.\n\n![In this file photo from July 2021, Shane Durant watches the Bootleg Fire smoke plume while walking his dog near Bly, Ore.

But they will add to the drawdown from the buffer pool.\n\nCalifornia state officials say that the buffer pool still has plenty of credits to cover any carbon project setbacks.\n\nDavid Clegern, the public information officer for the California board, said that all of the credits initially put into the account to cover financial or disease setbacks also can be used for fire losses.\n\nBut as the wildfire toll on carbon projects mounts, California board officials are reviewing the risk formulas used to calculate contributions to the buffer.\n\n\u201cWe said wildfires are going to become a bigger deal.

Eight days later, lightning ignited the Bootleg Fire amid a prolonged Southern Oregon drought. The fire spread from west to east. It sent up giant plumes of smoke that would collapse on themselves, creating fierce downdrafts that acted like bellows to spread flames that eventually destroyed more than 400 buildings.\n\nGreen Diamond forestry crews quickly mobilized, using bulldozers and feller bunchers to carve out lines to try to block the flames\u2019 advance. In a single day, the fire moved more than 7 miles to the east and overwhelmed that effort.

These jumbles of logjams are intended to help the waterway recover.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really challenging for people\u2019s perceptions. \u2026 You imagine this nice little quiet stream, and it\u2019s all open,\u201d said Leigh Ann Vradenburg, who is project manager for Klamath Watershed Partnership, which organized those efforts on Green Diamond lands. \u201cBut any functional stream is messy. The downed wood is a necessary part of any stream ecosystem, especially post-fire.\u201d\n\nWithin the Green Diamond burn zone, which stretches across more than 100,000 acres, the vast majority of the dead trees have been left on the land. They had scant market value, and clearing them away would have been a massive, expensive and time-consuming task.\n\nDavis and Kostick, the forest manager, hope that the dead trees will provide a benefit. They can act like sunscreen, cooling the hot summer air for the young seedlings that have been planted underneath them in this arid forest.\n\nOn a 90-degree day earlier this summer, they parked their trucks along a roadway, then entered a severely scorched area to inspect several tiny ponderosa pines that grew in powdery white soil beneath a graveyard of older trees.\n\nThey noted some browning in the slender green shoots of the seedlings, and spotted a beetle-like insect \u2014 a weevil \u2014 that appeared to be responsible for the damage. But overall, they were encouraged. The seedlings stood about a foot high, nearly double the height of their size when planted a year ago.\n\n![A small ponderosa pine seedling in its second growing season in Klamath Basin forest, June 29, 2023.

Warmer, drier and hotter summers could slow the growth of the next generation of trees. In some areas, forests are likely to give way to brush or grasslands. Fires are forecast to grow larger.\n\nThe standing dead trees, which still retain most of the forest carbon, would provide plenty of fuel should a new fire reach the Bootleg burn zone.\n\nTo try to fend off the next runaway blaze, Green Diamond has embarked on a short-term strategy of removing carbon from the forest to try to up the chance for its long-term survival.\n\nAlong some stretches of road, Green Diamond crews have stripped away 100-foot-wide swaths of timber to create a stronger network of fire breaks.\n\nDavis said reducing tree density also can help these forests survive.\n\nSome 7,000 acres burned by Bootleg went through a major thinning that turned smaller trees into chips hauled to a Klamath Falls fiberboard plant and left larger trees with more space to grow. The tree density, in some 20 different tracts, was reduced by some 75%.\n\nEven without an additional treatment \u2014 prescribed fire undertaken on some nearby parcels of Forest Service land \u2014 most trees in the thinned forests are still alive in what Davis said was one of the few \u201csilver linings\u201d to emerge from the Bootleg Fire.\n\n![](https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/4gluI28ANKZZImqtZdKKUTU5a-c=/150x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/opb/ZVV26GYY5NBMZB4ZCZWPRQYPM4.jpg)The Klamath tribes worked in collaboration with the Forest Service, to thin and conduct prescribed burns in this area months before the Bootleg Fire swept through, resulting in less fuel for the fire.\n\n*Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPB*\n\n![](https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/iiKtnzI23Dshgtck-4TpqQVlg6g=/150x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/opb/2HN7E6THKJETLKGAIFEVZZSFIY.jpg)Tim Sexton, fire program manager for the Klamath Tribes, walks through a section of woods that mostly survived the 2021 Bootleg Fire, June 30, 2023. \u201cWe're pretty proud of that,\" Sexton said. \"And we're intending to do much more of that kind of work in the future because we're concerned about our treaty rights on those lands, that are subject to high-intensity fire.\u201c \n\n*Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPB*\n\n![](https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/GFQYq5H5otdwzhmDDFXKvugZh4s=/150x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/opb/LFHNVFYHEZBU7JLPL3N2QFHX5U.jpg)Sexton looks at a section of woods that did not undergo tree thinning and prescribed burning, and nearly 100% of those trees were killed in the Bootleg Fire.

Carbon finance is the general term applied to financing the purchase of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to offset emissions in OECD countries. Climate finance refers to the funds required for addressing the climate change whereas a carbon finance is the revenue realized by projects through sale of carbon credits earned. Climate finance aims to reduce emissions and increase sinks of greenhouse gases. Carbon finance also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable development. Climate and carbon finance is a subset of environmental (green) finance.\n\n **Key Trends and Analysis of the Global** **Climate and Carbon Finance** **Market:**\n\n Increasing adoption of carbon pricing is one of the key trends expected to propel the growth of the global climate and carbon finance market. For instance, carbon pricing (CO 2 pricing) is a method or an approach used to address climate change. Its overarching goal is to protect the environment, discourage the use of carbon dioxide-emitting fossil fuels, and address the causes of climate change to meet national or international climate agreements. Japan, the world's 5th-biggest carbon emitter, raised its climate goal in April 2021, pledging to trim emissions by 46% from 2013 levels by 2030 instead of its previous target of 26%. If this is achieved, 2030 emissions will be 0.76 billion tons. The scheme is launched to curb emissions and achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\n **Global** **Climate and Carbon Finance** **Market \u2013 Drivers**\n\n **Increasing** **carbon** **emissions** **to augment** **the** **market growth** \n\n With the rapid growth in carbon emissions (also referred to as greenhouse gas or GHG emissions) across the globe, the use or adoption of climate and carbon finance is also increasing with a rapid pace. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes grew 0.9% or 321 Mt in 2022 to a new all-time high of 36.8 Gt. Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tons, their highest ever level, as the world economy rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 crisis and relied heavily on coal to power that growth.\n\n **Climate** **And** **Carbon Finance Market Report Coverage**\n\n \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Report Coverage** | **Details** |\n| **Base Year:** | 2022 |  | **Market Size in 2022:** | US$ 355.44 Bn |\n| **Historical Data for:** | 2017 to 2021 | **Forecast Period:** | 2023 - 2030 |\n| **Forecast Period 2023 to 2030 CAGR:** | 29.3% |  | **2030 Value Projection:** | US$ 2,776.82 Bn |\n| **Geographies covered:** | * **North America:**\u00a0U.S. and Canada\n* **Latin America:**\u00a0Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Rest of Latin America\n* **Europe:**\u00a0Germany, U.K., Spain, France, Italy, Russia, and Rest of Europe\n* **Asia Pacific:**\u00a0China, India, Japan, Australia, South Korea, ASEAN, and Rest of Asia Pacific\n* **Middle East:**\u00a0GCC Countries, Israel, and Rest of Middle East\n* **Africa:**\u00a0South Africa, North Africa, and Central Africa\n |\n| **Segments covered:** | * **By Market Type:**\u00a0Voluntary Market, Compliance Market\n* **By Project Type:**\u00a0Renewable Energy Projects, Energy Efficiency Projects, Forest Carbon Projects, Methane Capture and Utilization Projects, Waste Management Projects, Agriculture and Land Use Projects, Others\n* **By Buyer Type:**Corporates, Governments, Financial Institutions, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Individuals\n* **By Carbon Market Mechanism:**\u00a0Cap and Trade (Emissions Trading System), Carbon Offsetting (Voluntary Carbon Credits), Carbon Pricing (Carbon Tax or Fee)\n* **By Sector Focus:**\u00a0Energy and Utilities, Transportation, Manufacturing and Industrial Processes, Agriculture and Forestry, Buildings and Construction, Waste Management, Others\n* **By Transaction Type:**\u00a0Spot Market, Forward Market, Futures Market\n* **By Market Participants:**\u00a0Carbon Project Developers, Carbon Market Intermediaries (Brokers, Consultants), Carbon Credit Verifiers and Validators, Exchange Platforms\n |\n| **Companies covered:** | Climate Finance Partners (United States), Carbon Credit Capital (United States), ClimateCare (United Kingdom), South Pole Group (Switzerland), Climate Trust Capital (United States), Carbon Clear (United Kingdom), EcoAct (France), First Climate (Germany), ClimatePartner (Germany), Ecosphere+ (United Kingdom), Verra (United States), Gold Standard (Switzerland), Natural Capital Partners (United Kingdom), Climate Friendly (Australia), Forest Carbon (United Kingdom) |\n| **Growth Drivers:** | * Regulatory Frameworks\n* International Agreements\n* Investor Demand\n* Corporate Sustainability Initiatives\n |\n| **Restraints & Challenges:** | * Policy and Regulatory Uncertainty\n* Volatility and Fluctuations in Carbon Markets\n* Measurement and Verification Challenges\n |\n\n **Government** **initiatives or** **support to propel market growth**\n\n Many governments around the world have adopted norms to curb emissions and achieve their goal of carbon neutrality. In June 2023, Government of India took a step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability by launching the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme 2023. The Indian government has green-lighted the creation of a national carbon market that will be key to decarbonizing heavy industry and helping shape international carbon trading, getting the country on track to meet its net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal by the promised date of 2070. This in turn is expected to augment the growth of the market.\n\n **Global** **Climate and Carbon Finance** **Market \u2013 Restrain**\n\n **Uncertainty in regulations** **to hamper market growth**\n\n One of the key factors expected to hamper growth of the global [climate and carbon finance market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jnCEbewaAEouqFtHExCWJmxoz3la2HJuryPF3eIrM1ukK-CWw-YPqhh7-ipFB4yF2UmR4N8X_KeliUT5mhCm-_vyRYHoTFWoLWhDZWKy_ned19TM6OzmhD9-aklHKJx9bMC2SH53_1zOhdJNb3ktTSm-2uIWp6coeDTWoOEHtXWnCuGAt9oHcZND_bUbDf_sI_nOmZtAG_PzuyPH9-Jp9A== \"climate and carbon finance market\")\u00a0is the uncertainty in climate policies and regulations. For instance, uncertainty in climate policies and regulations can pose challenges for investors and market participants. Lack of harmonization across jurisdictions, shift in climate policies, and changes in government priorities can hamper the long-term planning and investment decision-making in the climate and carbon finance market. The volatility can affect the financial viability of carbon projects and introduce uncertainties for market participants, especially in developing countries with limited resources and capacity.\n\n **Global** **Climate and Carbon Finance** **Market \u2013 Opportunities**\n\n Increasing demand for carbon offsets and credits is expected to offer lucrative growth opportunities for players in the global climate and carbon finance market. For instance, carbon offset schemes allow companies and/or individuals to invest in environmental projects to balance out their carbon footprints. In November 2021, Government of India announced that India will reach its net zero carbon emission target by 2070 with the country's climate action plan. India will reduce one billion tonne of the total projected carbon emission between now and 2030. By 2030, India will reduce its economy's carbon intensity to less than 45% and India will achieve the target of net zero emissions by 2070.

Some of the U.S. cities that were especially affected by the heat spikes this year include Cape Coral, Florida; Miami, Florida; and Mesa, Arizona.   \n\n\n[Texas,](https://gizmodo.com/heat-wave-hits-the-southwest-100-degrees-1850621216) [Arizona](https://gizmodo.com/heat-wave-hits-the-southwest-100-degrees-1850621216), [California](https://gizmodo.com/california-long-scalding-hot-week-extreme-heat-1850628474), and [Florida](https://gizmodo.com/93-million-americans-under-heat-warnings-death-valley-1850641037) all roasted under various heat waves this July. The Phoenix metropolitan area saw a record 31 consecutive days where temperatures were above 110\u00b0F (43.3 Celsius) or higher. This shattered a previous record of 18 days with those temperatures back in June 1974. Miami saw a heat index that surpassed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius), for 46 days straight. This started in early June and didn\u2019t end until July 26, according to the report.\n\nThere were signs earlier this year that the world was in for a long hot, climate-change summer. The Pacific Northwest saw an [unseasonably early heat wave this May](https://gizmodo.com/heat-wave-pacific-northwest-seattle-hoquiam-may-2023-1850437995). The normally temperate region saw early highs that were more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than average for that time of the year. During that heat wave, Seattle experienced temperatures around 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 Celsius). During that same month, Vietnam [recorded its hottest temperature ever](https://gizmodo.com/vietnam-hottest-record-temperature-2023-1850414201).

During those 24 hours, the average temperature throughout the world was 62.62 degrees Fahrenheit (17.01 Celsius), according to data from the University of Maine\u2019s [Climate Change Institute](https://climatechange.umaine.edu/). About 60 degrees Fahrenheit doesn\u2019t sound too hot, but consider that this is an average temperature. That means nighttime temperatures and temperature readings at the poles are rising due to global warming.\n\nIt is now August and the heat hasn\u2019t exactly waned in the gulf. States in the lower plains and central Gulf region are experiencing excessive heat warnings and advisories this week, [according to](https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd) the National Weather Service. Parts of Texas will see heat indices at around 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius). And across the pond, countries throughout the Mediterranean are seeing droughts and heat that have fueled wildfires.

Can new voluntary guidelines fix that? | Grist", "content": "\nThe idea behind voluntary carbon offsets seems simple enough: Project developers undertake some kind of activity to either prevent carbon emissions or remove them from the atmosphere, like building a solar farm or planting trees. The project generates carbon credits, approved by a handful of unregulated carbon crediting programs and purchased by companies, governments, or individuals that want to offset some of their own emissions.\n\n\nIn reality, however, the market for these offsets is \u201c[riddled with fraud](https://foe.org/news/farm-bill-alliance/),\u201d with offset projects too often [failing to deliver](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-21/top-carbon-offset-registries-are-failing-to-stop-junk-credits?sref=wINQCNXe) their [promised emission](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/chevron-carbon-offset-climate-crisis) [reductions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe). Common issues include nonpermanence, in which carbon removed from the atmosphere can\u2019t be proven or expected to *stay* removed; nonadditionality, in which offsets don\u2019t result in greater emission reductions than would have been expected without the offset project; and double-counting, in which the same offset is counted toward the emission reduction targets of two separate entities. Over the past couple of years, these problems have become so pervasive that they\u2019re scaring buyers away: According to a [BloombergNEF analysis](https://www.youtube.com/live/Nq-ewSmP1F4?feature=share), concerns around integrity and transparency were \u201cthe biggest reason\u201d that demand for carbon credits contracted between 2021 and 2022, even as supply continued to grow.\n\n\nTo restore trust, many buyers, sellers, and brokers have looked to the [Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets](https://icvcm.org/), or ICVCM, an independent, nongovernmental oversight body. In the absence of supervision from countries or intergovernmental bodies like the United Nations, the widely-respected ICVCM is the closest thing to a regulator that the industry for voluntary carbon credits has. Since last year, the ICVCM has been [working on a set of guidelines](https://icvcm.org/integrity-council-announces-timetable-for-new-voluntary-carbon-market-standards/) to create a \u201cdefinitive global threshold standard for high-quality carbon credits,\u201d with rules on everything from permanence to monitoring and consultation with Indigenous peoples, plus specifications for different types of carbon credits. It [finalized the last parts of the guidelines last week](https://icvcm.org/global-benchmark-for-high-integrity-carbon-credits-aims-to-mobilize-climate-finance-at-speed-and-scale/) and invited carbon crediting programs to apply for special labels showing their credits are compliant with the new criteria.\n\n\nNow that the rules are out, however, it\u2019s not clear that they go far enough to address the industry\u2019s pervasive reliability issues. While some carbon registries and brokers [have](https://verra.org/verra-welcomes-new-icvcm-criteria/) [applauded](https://www.patch.io/blog/core-carbon-comeback-icvcms-blueprint-for-scaled-accountability) them for setting up additional safeguards against double-counting and requiring more documentation on how offset projects advance sustainable development, the voluntary carbon markets\u2019 problems run very deep, and, according to some, require a greater overhaul. Carbon Market Watch, a European nonprofit, said the ICVCM\u2019s guidelines \u201cprovide a set of much needed incremental improvements, but [fail to raise the quality of carbon credits sufficiently](https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2023/07/27/integrity-councils-rulebook-sets-minimum-threshold-instead-of-high-bar-for-carbon-markets/) and leave too much wiggle room to truly tackle the climate crisis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

These types of nature-based projects can be highly risky, since unforeseen natural disasters or human activity \u2014\u00a0a wildfire, for example, or illegal logging \u2014 can wipe out their carbon-sequestering capabilities. While the ICVCM recognizes that there is a \u201c[material risk of reversal](https://icvcm.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CCP-Book-R2-FINAL-26Jul23.pdf)\u201d for these activities \u2014 meaning there\u2019s a chance the carbon they lock up could be released \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re still allowed in the new framework, as long as carbon-crediting programs agree to monitor them for at least 40 years. If any of the sequestered carbon does get released in that timeframe, the credit issuer has to cancel the original credits and issue new ones drawn from a \u201cbuffer reserve.\u201d\n\n\nCarbon Market Watch says that\u2019s not enough. It objects to the very idea that parking carbon in nonpermanent sinks like forests can balance out carbon emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels. \u201cThere is no scientific equivalence between the two,\u201d said Gilles Dufrasne, Carbon Market Watch\u2019s lead on global carbon markets. While fossil fuel-based carbon emissions last in the atmosphere for centuries to millennia, that\u2019s just not the case with most biological systems, which can unexpectedly [go up in flames](https://grist.org/wildfires/california-forests-carbon-offsets-reduce-emissions/) or be destroyed by disease. Even if you monitor a project for 40 years, a reversal could still occur in year 41 \u2014 or 401, for that matter.\n\n\n\u201cThe logic of offsetting itself when it comes to nature-based solutions is inadequate,\u201d Dufrasne added.\u00a0\n\n\nGiven that nature-based solutions accounted for [two-thirds](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-rising-demand-for-nature-based-climate-solutions/) of voluntary carbon markets\u2019 transaction value in 2021, it would be a major change for the ICVCM to disallow them. Gabriel Labbate, a member of the core expert panel that advises other ICVCM committees on technical matters, acknowledged concerns about permanence but said the council\u2019s new guidelines are just \u201ca first step.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors. [Become one](https://grist.org/advertising/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider [disabling your ad-blocker](https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist) to allow ads on Grist. [Here's How](https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist)\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is not the last thing the ICVCM will do in regard to the permanence of nature-based solution credits,\u201d he told Grist, adding that future iterations of the organization\u2019s guidelines could increase the monitoring requirement to 100 years. He said the council\u2019s rules were \u201csufficiently stringent and their stringency will improve over time.\u201d\n\n\nCarbon Market Watch also takes issue with wording in the guidelines that makes it unclear what kind of offsetting activities will be eligible for the ICVCM stamp of approval. At least six times throughout its new documents, the ICVCM says participating carbon crediting programs can follow their own rules for demonstrating additionality or quantifying the emission reduction from a given type of carbon credit, so long as they submit an \u201cexplanation\u201d stating why their approach is as good as the ICVCM\u2019s.\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily create a loophole for bogus offsets, but it could open the door to abuse. When programs submit an explanation to the ICVCM, \u201cyou get into the black box on who\u2019s deciding whether the explanation is satisfactory or not,\u201d Dufrasne said. \u201cYou get out of the more objective framework, which is kind of what the whole exercise has been about.\u201d\n\n\nAndrew Howard, senior director of climate policy and strategy for Verra, the voluntary carbon markets\u2019 largest issuer of carbon credits, resisted that characterization. He said the open-endedness in the ICVCM\u2019s guidelines reflect the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of voluntary carbon markets. \u201cThere are many roads\u201d to a high-quality carbon credit, Howard said, and \u201cby not locking down prescriptive methods of how accrediting programs work, the ICVCM is allowing space for new innovation to occur.\u201d\n\n\nThe ICVCM agreed. Daniel Ortega-Pacheco, director of the sustainability consulting company Biochar and a co-chair of the ICVCM\u2019s expert panel, said flexibility could help the ICVCM \u201clearn from current practices in the market.\u201d The explanations will still be subject to scrutiny from an independent body of experts, he told Grist, and are not intended to be a \u201cfree pass\u201d for carbon credit issuers.\n\n\nOver the next several years, the ICVCM is planning further updates to its guidelines for voluntary carbon markets, as conditions change and as new science comes out on offsets and their efficacy. The next iteration is due in 2025.

Yet today, no leading CCS facility is up and fully running in the UK.\n\nUntil [Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement on Monday](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis), there were two carbon capture projects in the UK, one in Merseyside and the other in Teesside and the Humber. Two further transport and storage projects, the Viking scheme in the Humber and the Acorn scheme in Aberdeenshire, have now been given government approval. The four CCS hubs are intended to collect CO2 from multiple sources and pipe it offshore to be stored in depleting North Sea gas fields.\n\nBut, according to Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, announcing more CCS schemes at the same time as approving 100-plus new oil and gas drilling licences is like ordering a truckload of cigarettes for someone giving up smoking.\n\nHaszeldine said: \u201cThat\u2019s what yesterday\u2019s announcement was doing. CCS should be part of a package of things that you have to do \u2013 increasing renewables to switch our energy from burning gas and oil, doubling or even quadrupling the amount of electricity we have now, building in more efficiency in how we use our energy with insulation. It should be part of this package.\u201d\n\nCCS involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities, such as chemical plants and oil refineries, then transporting and storing it.\n\nThe UK\u2019s geology is suitable for storing carbon, and empty oilfields in the North Sea have been selected for storage. CCS is intended to be used in the transition to net zero to capture carbon from industries that will be harder to decarbonise, including cement, iron and steel, according to Haszeldine.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn these industries, CCS can help and will be essential to get to net zero.\u201d\n\nA second nascent industry in capturing CO2 from the atmosphere is less developed than CCS linked to industrial facilities. The process of removing CO2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions.\n\nJim Watson, professor of energy policy and director of the Institute for Sustainable Resources at University College London, said he understood the scepticism of some environmentalists about CCS because it could be viewed as \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for oil and gas companies to continue getting fossil fuels out of the ground.\n\nWatson said: \u201cBut we do need it. If you look at independent assessments, including from the climate change committee, it is hard to see how to decarbonise the whole of industry without some carbon capture and storage.\u201d\n\nThe history of CCS in the UK is chequered. One of the first CCS strategies was in 2006, and there have been many false starts over the years.\n\nEven today, some projects already operating around the world have not been as successful as planned. In Australia, the CCS project run by Chevron has not yet made its Gorgon project meet its target of 80% carbon dioxide capture.\n\nA recent report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) on two Norwegian projects that store carbon dioxide under the seabed called into question the long-term viability of CCS.\n\nIts author, Grant Hauber, IEEFA\u2019s strategic energy finance adviser, said the Norwegian Sleipner and Sn\u00f8hvit CCS fields have been cited as global success stories, but because of the unpredictability of the subsurface conditions they cannot be used as definitive models for the future of the industry.\n\nHauber said: \u201cEvery project site has unique geology. Subsurface conditions which exist at a given point on the Earth are specific to that place. Even then, any information obtained about that place is only a snapshot in time. The Earth moves and strata can change.\u201d\n\nThere is also a need to make sure the CO2 is stored in the ground permanently rather than allowing fossil fuel companies to use it to drill for more oil and gas elsewhere. This requires regulation and monitoring, said Watson.\n\nThe timeframe for CCS is tight. The UK target is to raise the amount of CO2 captured from zero today to between 20m and 30m tonnes by 2030.\n\nWatson said: \u201cThere are still big questions about whether it can deliver the kind of numbers of storage that we need by this time.\u201d\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The UK recently approved two new carbon capture projects in addition to the existing two, but experts argue that this is not enough without also increasing renewables and energy efficiency measures.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Experts argue that approving carbon capture projects without also addressing renewable energy and efficiency is insufficient."}, {"summary": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is seen as essential for industries that are difficult to decarbonize, such as cement, iron, and steel.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "CCS is viewed as necessary for achieving net-zero emissions in industries that are hard to decarbonize."}, {"summary": "The success of CCS projects around the world has been mixed, with some projects failing to meet their carbon capture targets.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "CCS projects have had varying degrees of success, with some failing to meet their targets."}, {"summary": "The long-term viability of CCS is questioned due to unique geological conditions and the need for stringent regulation and monitoring.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The long-term viability of CCS is questioned due to geological variations and the need for strict regulation."}, {"summary": "There are concerns about whether CCS can achieve the necessary levels of carbon storage by the UK's target of 2030.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Experts raise concerns about whether CCS can meet the UK's carbon storage targets by 2030."}], "semantic_commentary": "CCS essential for difficult industries but not enough without renewables.", "sentiment_score": -0.4, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions carbon capture and storage technology, which relates to systems and technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article discusses news about carbon, specifically the approval of new carbon capture projects and concerns about achieving carbon storage targets."}]}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carbon-reports-second-quarter-2023-210000478.html", "title": "Base Carbon Reports Second-Quarter 2023 Financial Results", "content": "![Base Carbon Inc.](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vEYK46PsvnIN1xnmNYRUSQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQyMDtoPTE3ODtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/6a2363ceb0b3e77253e30f2fcacf6f13)Base Carbon Inc.*First Vietnam Project Carbon Credits Issued and Monetized*\n\nTORONTO, Aug. 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Base Carbon Inc.

Credit: The Conversation\n  \n\n\nIf we have not been warned of the dangers of climate change this summer, we never will be. Extreme heat, forest fires and floods have been all over news reports. Yet the oil and gas industry remains largely in denial.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe [International Energy Agency (IEA) says](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050) steep cuts in oil and gas production are necessary to reach the Paris (COP 21) goal of keeping global warming at 1.5\u2103. However, only a tiny fraction of the industry, accounting for less than 5% of oil and gas output, has targets aligned with the IEA's \"net zero\" requirements.\n\n\nThe current secretary general of production cartel Opec, Haitham al-Ghais, [expects global oil demand](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/7168.htm#:~:text=In%20our%20WOO%2C%20we%20see,reaching%209.5%20billion%20by%202045.) to rise by about 10% to 110 million barrels a day by 2045, a volume incompatible with the Paris goals. The UK government has [just offered](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licenses-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis) a helping hand, granting around 100 new North Sea licenses. What are we to make of this mismatch?\n\n\nThe new denialism\n-----------------\n\n\nTypical of the new breed of climate denialism is a [recent report](https://eprinc.org/a-critical-assessment-of-the-ieas-net-zero-scenario-esg-and-the-cessation-of-investment-in-new-oil-and-gas-fields/) by the Energy Policy Research Foundation (ERPF), a body funded by the US government and various undisclosed corporate interests and foundations. It sees the IEA's requirements as a \"seal of approval \u2026 to block investment in oil and [gas production](https://phys.org/tags/gas+production/) by western companies\". The report views meeting the targets as too costly, too harsh on [poor countries](https://phys.org/tags/poor+countries/) and too bad for the energy security of the west.\n\n\nIn fact, it is wrong on each account. Many eminent economists and scientists use the concept of the social cost of carbon (SCC), which is defined as the cost to society of releasing an additional ton of CO\u2082. [Expert estimates](https://web.mit.edu/rpindyck/www/Papers/SCCRevisitedJEEM2019.pdf) from 2019 put this at between US$171 and US$310 (\u00a3133 to \u00a3241). If we go with, say, US$240 per ton, the social cost of continued carbon equivalent emissions comes out at almost US$8.5 trillion every year.\n\n\nA [recent study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1d0b&lang=de) has factored into the calculation [climate feedback loops](https://earthhow.com/climate-feedback-loops/). This is where one problem caused by global warming leads to others, such as melting permafrost unleashing stores of methane.\n\n\nWhen the study estimated the [economic damage](https://phys.org/tags/economic+damage/) that this could cause, it produced an SCC in excess of US$5,000. That implies annual costs of more like US$170 trillion a year, which makes the US$4 trillion investment into [clean energy](https://phys.org/tags/clean+energy/) that the [IEA thinks necessary](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050) to meet the Paris climate goals look like a drop in the ocean.\n\n\nIt may help to break this down to one barrel of oil. A [special IEA report](https://www.iea.org/reports/emissions-from-oil-and-gas-operations-in-net-zero-transitions) for COP28 estimates that on average, each barrel of oil emits 0.53 tons of CO\u2082 equivalent in greenhouse gas across its life cycle, 20% of which comes from production.\n\n\nGoing back to our average SSC per ton of US$240, that points to a social cost of US$126 per barrel. With oil currently at US$85 per barrel, the societal damage from producing, transporting, refining and consuming it is far greater\u2014and that's before including climate feedbacks.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the arguments by the EPRF and like-minded supporters about energy security are laughable. The history of the oil and [gas industry](https://phys.org/tags/gas+industry/) is a history of wars and geopolitical tensions. Transitioning to cleaner fuels can only increase our energy security and reduce the need to police remote autocracies.\n\n\nThe argument that poor countries need to continue burning carbon for development reasons is no better. In its [latest report from 2022](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport.pdf), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said climate change would probably see an increase in \"losses and damages, strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations\".\n\n\nEqually, the World Health Organization [estimates that](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health#:~:text=Key%20facts,malaria%2C%20diarrhoea%20and%20heat%20stress): \"Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHow to respond\n--------------\n\n\nThe denialists offer no alternatives to cutting carbon emissions, and often simply ignore climate change altogether. The [recent ERPF report](https://eprinc.org/a-critical-assessment-of-the-ieas-net-zero-scenario-esg-and-the-cessation-of-investment-in-new-oil-and-gas-fields/) mentions climate change only four times. It is as if heatwaves, [forest fires](https://phys.org/tags/forest+fires/), flooding, rising sea levels and the demise of natural habitat caused by climate inaction were happening on another planet.\n\n\nWe still have time to limit [global warming](https://phys.org/tags/global+warming/) below 1.5\u2103. It is true that we will need oil and gas for many years, and that there are currently no alternatives for certain sectors such as air travel, shipping and some industries. Nonetheless, there is still much that can be done now to make a substantial difference.\n\n\nTo incentivize the transition to cleaner energy, governments need to end [fossil fuel subsidies](https://phys.org/tags/fossil+fuel+subsidies/), which the [IMF estimates](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/climate-change/energy-subsidies) amounted to US$5.9 trillion in 2020 alone. We also need to put a proper price on carbon\u2014only 40 countries have attempted this so far, and [none has it](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon#:~:text=Some%2040%20countries%20and%20more,implement%20them%20in%20the%20future) anywhere near the estimated social cost of emitting carbon.\n\n\nCountries that resist charging their own polluters should face a carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is a tariff that effectively puts the polluter on the same footing as local players. If all the actors in the fossil fuel supply chain had to face the cost of the damage they cause, the need to phase out long-term investments in fossil fuels would become more obvious.\n\n\nThe IEA requirements for \"net zero\" are just one of the pathways towards meeting the Paris goal of 1.5\u2103 warming. Others are explored by some of the more credible actors in the petroleum industry, such as [Shell](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/the-energy-security-scenarios.html), [BP](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/sustainability/getting-to-net-zero.html) and Norway's [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/sustainability/energy-perspectives), but all require a substantial decline in oil demand and production by 2050.\n\n\nInstead of criticizing efforts to slow climate change and sponsoring ridiculous reports calling for more fossil fuels, [the oil industry should](https://www.iea.org/reports/emissions-from-oil-and-gas-operations-in-net-zero-transitions) eliminate leakages, venting and flaring of methane, and electrify as many processes as possible using renewable power. It should also employ carbon capture, usage and storage technologies over the next ten years\u2014yes this will increase the price of fossil fuels, but that is exactly what we need to make clean sources of energy competitive across the board and speed up the energy transition.\n\n\nThe sooner the industry starts facing up to the realities of climate change, the more chance it has to survive. The companies and even countries that produce fossil fuels will have to face and pay the cost for the damage they cause. Those costs are already massive and will grow. Those that survive will do so only as a provider of clean and sustainable energy.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n Provided by\n [The Conversation](https://phys.org/partners/the-conversation/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This article is republished from [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com) under a Creative Commons license.

Trees are a salable crop, but also offer shade, climate benefits and wildlife habitat. Wetlands protect against property damage from flooding. New York City owes its high-quality drinking water to the Catskill and Delaware watersheds.\n\n\nNon-economic benefits are also considered, such as environmental impacts on physical and mental health and recreation. If an ecosystem underpins a Native American tribe\u2019s religious practice, for example, that\u2019s also an ecosystem service.\n\n\nThe guidance sets best practices for agencies to ensure that these social goods are given equal footing with other costs and benefits during regulatory review.\n\n\n\u201cWe must measure what we value, not just value what is simple to measure,\u201d Revesz and Prabhakar wrote.\n\n\nThe draft guidance directs agencies to broaden the scope of their analyses to fully account for ecosystem services. It requests a clear description of the link between the proposed action and any changes to the ecosystem that could harm or benefit humans.\n\n\nWhere possible, agencies are asked to assign a dollar value to a policy\u2019s effect on an ecosystem service.\n\n\nMethodologies to measure the financial value of the environment have become more sophisticated in recent years. The Biden administration is in the midst of updating social cost of greenhouse gas metrics to incorporate fresh scholarship about what each incremental ton of emissions costs humanity. The values allow climate change to be considered beside a rule\u2019s other economic impacts.\n\n\nSimilar global metrics don\u2019t exist for many ecosystem services. But Eli Fenichel, a professor of natural resource economics at Yale University, said those other factors are often easier to tag with financial values because they\u2019re narrower in scope \u2014 for example, a rule that effects urban cooling in Phoenix.\n\n\n\u201cFor many of these other ecosystem services, because they are local, when we do get numbers, we actually have a lot of confidence in them,\u201d he said.\n\n\nThe guidance document stresses that it doesn\u2019t impose any new requirements on agencies. And Fenichel noted that the OMB cost-benefit guidance that has been in place for 20 years doesn\u2019t exclude natural resources or the environmental impacts from consideration. There just hasn\u2019t until now been a clear blueprint for how agencies consider those benefits and costs, he said.\n\n\n\u201cThis has been a long time coming,\u201d said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School.\n\n\nWagner pointed to a [1999 paper](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/6374/natures-numbers-expanding-the-national-economic-accounts-to-include-the) by economists William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg that urged the U.S. government to improve its environmental accounting, which he said was finally realized when the White House released an [economic accounting road map](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Natural-Capital-Accounting-Strategy-final.pdf) earlier this year that for the first time included environmental assets.\n\n\nThis week\u2019s guidance, Wagner said, brings those social goods into the regulatory review process, affirming that \u201cyes, nature provides crucial services that ought to be considered when making decisions.\u201d\n\n\nWhen those benefits aren\u2019t considered, he added, \u201cwe basically treat natural assets as if they\u2019re simply there for the taking.\u201d\n\n\nUnder that scheme, he said, a tree is only valuable when it is harvested as timber and not when it is preserved as a source of shade, natural carbon removal, wildlife habitat and scenic beauty. There\u2019s no cost assigned to policies or decisions that degrade watersheds that cities depend on for drinking water or the wetlands that guard them against storm surges \u2014 even though replacing those natural features with man-made alternatives would be costly.\n\n\nThe draft guidance would also inform projects by by the Army Corps of Engineers or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Fenichel said.\n\n\n\u201cFor example, a decision related to building, say, a sea wall versus using wetlands restoration to manage coastal flooding \u2014 this could very much tip the scales in a decision like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\nJames Goodwin, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Progressive Reform who is skeptical of cost-benefit analysis as a predicate for rulemakings, said the new guidance is an improvement.\n\n\n\u201cObviously, an acre of wetland is worth much more than just the \u2018ecosystem services\u2019 that it provides. But that is a component of its value,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is a component of its value that I think is not ethically troublesome to put a monetary value on.\u201d\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The White House will release draft guidance requiring federal agencies to account for how their decisions affect ecosystems the public depends on, targeting the benefits derived from forests, wetlands, and waterways.

Occidental and ADNOC and may also evaluate jointly developing one or more UAE-located CO2 sequestration hubs and consider commencing feasibility and pre-front-end engineering and design studies for a 1 million tonne-per-year DAC plant, which together would provide emissions reduction solutions for carbon-intensive industrial emitters and other hard-to-abate sectors within the UAE, including aviation and maritime operations.\n\n\nThrough the collaboration, the companies will also consider opportunities to incorporate innovative CO2-based technologies into the UAE. This includes technologies in which Occidental has made investments, such as emissions-free power and sustainable fuels.\n\n\n*'We look forward to building on our longstanding partnership with ADNOC as we advance our plans to globally deploy DAC technology and engage partners who are committed to developing carbon solutions at climate-relevant scale,'* **said Vicki Hollub, Occidental President and CEO**. *'Partnerships like this one are essential to helping the world reach its climate goals and ensure it has the resources it needs to thrive through the energy transition. We look forward to working with ADNOC on our shared vision of establishing a global net-zero ecosystem.'*\n\n\nThe agreement is enabled by the ***UAE-U.S. Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE)***, which was launched in November 2022 and is expected to mobilize ***$100 billion in clean energy and carbon management projects, including CCS and DAC by 2035***.\n\n\n**Amos Hochstein, White House Senior Advisor to the President for Energy and Investment said:** *'The world is going to need a host of technologies, including DAC and CCUS, to meet our global climate objectives. This important announcement is a great example of what the U.S.- UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) can help enable. I look forward to what this agreement yields.'*\n\n\nIn January 2023, an expert body was formed to govern PACE, co-chaired by His Excellency Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and ADNOC Managing Director and Group CEO, and Amos Hochstein, White House Senior Advisor to the President for Energy and Investment.\n\n\n**Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Executive Director of Low Carbon Solutions and International Growth at ADNOC said:** *'This agreement highlights how the UAE-U.S. Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy is driving innovative climate technologies to decarbonize the energy sector. The need to significantly reduce carbon emissions to address climate change is clear and urgent and carbon capture is an important technology that can be scaled up to decarbonize across all industries.*\n\n\n*'ADNOC\u2019s is a pioneer in carbon management, exemplified by our industry leading low-carbon intensity and our operation of Al Reyadah, the region\u2019s first commercial scale carbon capture facility. As ADNOC accelerates its net zero ambition to 2045 and decarbonizes our operations, partnerships like this offer the potential to transform the systems that will be vital to provide the lower-carbon energy the world needs for the energy transition.'*\n\n\n***1PointFive is currently constructing what is expected to be the world\u2019s largest DAC plant, named STRATOS, in Texas***. The facility, which will use technology provided by Canada-based Carbon Engineering, is designed to ***capture up to*** ***500,000 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year*** when fully operational. The DAC plant being evaluated by the companies in the UAE, if built, would use the same technology and could be the first megaton-scale facility of its kind outside of the United States.\n\n\n[Original article link](https://www.oxy.com/news/news-releases/occidental-and-adnoc-to-evaluate-carbon-management-projects-in-the-united-states-and-united-arab-emirates-to-accelerate-net-zero-goals/)\n\n\nSource: Occidental\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n[![Bookmark and Share](https://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif)](http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&pub=xa-4ae6da8537b0352d)[back to top \u00a0![Back to top](https://www.energy-pedia.com/images/misc/top.gif)](#container)  \n  \n\n\n![energy-pedia-opportunities logo](https://www.energy-pedia.com/images/misc/ep-opps-logo-white-bg.gif)\n  \n\nA global information service for upstream oil and gas opportunities - divestitures, farmins and farmouts and licensing rounds.\n\n  \n\nPublicly Available Deals\n------------------------\n\n\n* [MPP-Energy and Enpet Energy farming out the Duzce G26-A license, onshore Northern Turkey](https://www.energy-pediaopportunities.com/turkey-large-low-cost-onshore-gas-field-exploration/)\n* [3D Oil identifies possible Dorado-1 look-alike structures in WA-527-P, Bedout Sub-basin - farmout available (duplicate)](https://www.energy-pediaopportunities.com/wa-527-p/)\n* [AVS Group selling offshore oil and gas prospect](https://www.energy-pediaopportunities.com/oil-block-sale/)\n* [Finder Energy farming out AC/P 45 and AC/P 55, Northern Browse/Central Bonaparte Basin Ashmore Platform](https://www.energy-pediaopportunities.com/finder-energy-farming-out-browse-basin-licences-ac-p-45-55-in-australia/)\n* [3D Oil and Hibiscus Petroleum farming out VIC/P74, offshore Gippsland Basin](https://www.energy-pediaopportunities.com/vic-p74/)\n* [Enpet Energy farming out Duzce G26-A License in Northern Turkey](https://www.energy-pediaopportunities.com/onshore-turkey-duzce-g26-a-license-farm-out-interest/)\n* [See all deals...](https://www.energy-pediaopportunities.com/publicly-available-opportunities)\n\n  \n  \n\n\nSubscriber Only Deals\n---------------------\n\n\n\n\n### Current Deals\n\n\nCurrent Upstream Deals: 279\n\n\n\n\n### Completed Deals\n\n\nCompleted Upstream Deals: 6482\n\n\n\n\n### Company Profiles\n\n\nCurrent Company Profiles: 2892\n\n\n\n\n### Corporate Activity\n\n\nCurrent Corporate Activity articles: 4056\n\n\n\n\n### Companies Looking\n\n\nCurrent number of articles: 466\n\n\n\n\n### Company Sales\n\n\nCurrent Company Sales articles:1630\n\n\n\n\n### Geostudies\n\n\nCurrent Geostudies articles: 932\n\n\n[How to subscribe](https://www.energy-pediaopportunities.com/premium-subscription-service)\n\nenergy-pedia Jobs\n-----------------\n\n\n[RSS Feed Widget](http://feed.mikle.com/)[See all jobs...](http://www.energy-pediajobs.com/)  \n  \n\nenergy-pedia Databank\n---------------------\n\n\nThe energy-pedia databank contains links to information on the world financial and energy markets, including share prices, oil and gas prices and the global stock exchanges.

Tina Smith, D-Minn., and Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced a bill that Smith said would support the research needed to \u201cproperly credit soil carbon storage.\u201d\n\nThe USDA announcement and the legislation are both aimed at the difficult question of how to quantify carbon stored in soil.\n\nIt\u2019s an obstacle to overcome if the young and booming soil carbon market is to avoid the scrutiny, and skepticism, directed at carbon credit markets.\n\n![](https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/FmXha7sDEq8mRiT4jEi8p54U-Gs=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/RCQHUJ5BHNHOTFBDPZ65OM4SPU.jpg)Soil researcher Asmita Gautam (right) prepares a soil sample for carbon content analysis while talking with Shalamar Armstrong, associate professor of agronomy at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.

He runs a lab where researchers are investigating how farming management affects the amount of carbon in soil across different landscapes.\n\nHe and others at Purdue have been studying soil samples that date back more than 40 years, comparing different types of tilling and cover crops to determine their long-term effects on carbon storage.\n\nIt can take years of fieldwork, careful chemistry in the lab and lots of expensive equipment to puzzle that out.\n\nHe hopes his precise calculations will help farmers make decisions that allow them to receive worthwhile incentives for sequestering carbon while maintaining their existing profits.\n\n![](https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/mtv8iS8ED0qx5LAmTbJQ0Sic890=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/JWJAUMZQ2RB3NP6GAH4IMVP3PE.jpg)Shalamar Armstrong, associate professor of agronomy at Purdue University, holds a shovel full of soil in Fowler, Indiana. (AP photo/Joshua A. Bickel)\n\nBut other academics worry that even if farmers do get paid for storing soil carbon, it won\u2019t solve a bigger problem: that carbon markets often don\u2019t work.\n\nFor offsets to be legitimate, they have to meet four criteria. They have to store carbon that would otherwise be emitted; they have to be verifiable in data; they have to be immediate \u2014 planting a tree that might grow up in 20 years doesn\u2019t cut it; and they have to be long-lasting, said John Sterman, a professor of management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nBetter quantifying soil carbon storage through research might make the offsets more verifiable, but it doesn\u2019t address other factors.\n\nFor example, many farmers rent the land they work, and can\u2019t guarantee that carbon stored on their land will stay put in several decades if someone else is working the land.\n\nBarbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project at University of California, Berkeley, has worked on research that she said shows the effects of carbon offset projects are commonly overestimated, sometimes vastly so.\n\n\u201cCarbon trading is a mechanism that has failed miserably over the last 20 years that we really need to be moving away from,\u201d Haya said.\n\n![](https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/uo2Pdemj4Sffh24leIeNJNPLdSY=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/XC2CTQYGCZHY3LFFYE2PJQ7SQA.jpg)Soil researcher Asmita Gautam, a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, prepares a soil sample for carbon content analysis in West Lafayette, Indiana.

Jared Huffman, D-Calif., last month introduced a bipartisan bill to support farmers in improving soil health, with incentives that don\u2019t necessarily involve the carbon market.\n\nHe said farmers in his district have also described the benefits of regenerative practices, and that many would be interested in participating in carbon markets with \u201crobust\u201d accounting systems. But he added that those hoping for serious climate action shouldn\u2019t rely only on offsets.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s really not the silver bullet,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cI think offsets are inherently sketchy.\u201d\n\nSome farmers are moving cautiously.\n\nBrad Wetli, an Indiana farmer who collaborates with Armstrong, has been trying techniques that use less tilling and has been planting cover crops like rye for a few years now.\n\nHe\u2019s happy with the way his current fields look \u2014 \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re doing something\u201d to contribute to sustainability, he said \u2014 but he\u2019s still weighing his options with possible carbon credit contracts, doing the math and waiting to see whether the price will be right, since many offset agreements can last for several years.\n\n![](https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/x_tNILb5R-l-n47oQUjsSCGq6Z8=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/J3OANA6OHRC5PEEULIPPGY5PYI.jpg)Soil researcher Asmita Gautam, a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, prepares a soil sample for carbon content analysis in West Lafayette, Indiana.

A company gets a step closer to telling its investors and consumers it\u2019s reached net zero, and critical forest protection gets an injection of cash.\n\n\nThese days, forests generate a *lot* of credits: they represent one in three carbon credits sold through Verra, the largest of the voluntary carbon market administrators.\u00a0\n\n\nBut this market is plagued with problems. It [routinely inflates its climate impact](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe), diverts money to middlemen who cream off profits, and exploits Indigenous communities.

The only sure way to slow down climate change and meet net zero goals is to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTo understand the risks of forest carbon credits being sold as offsets, take a look at Guyana: a story of zombie carbon credits, dubious accounting, and a cosy relationship between offset schemes and the oil industry.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> [**UN deep-sea** mining talks deadlocked over agenda clash](https://climatechangenews.com/2023/07/27/un-deep-sea-mining-talks-deadlocked-over-agenda-clash/)\n> \n> \n\n\nGuyana\u2019s story begins with a calculated overstatement of the risk of deforestation. A report written by McKinsey in 2009 claimed that the country\u2019s forests could disappear at a rate of more than 4% per year, gone entirely within 25 years.\n\n\n Independent assessments show that the true rate of deforestation was actually around 0.2%. But the inflated McKinsey estimate had already established an attention-grabbing baseline number that would set the project up to report an impressive \u2013 but false \u2013 impact.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn a deal set up with the Norwegian government, Guyana received four payments totalling nearly $200 million for \u2018avoided deforestation\u2019. Recently, Guyana sold 33.5 million carbon credits for reducing forest loss during 2016 and 2020, this time under an ART-TREEs crediting scheme. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBut analysis of the methodology used shows that, as with previous payments to Guyana, the \u2018emissions reductions\u2019 may be largely fictitious. According to [one analysis](https://carbon-pulse.com/185976/), some 84% of these credits were created by accounting manipulations allowed under the scheme. \n\n\nIndependent evidence also suggests deforestation actually rose during the crediting period.

However, current methods of accurately estimating SOC are resource- and cost-intensive. In their new study, published in *Geoderma*, Agroecosystem Sustainability Center (ASC) researchers tested a new sampling method in hopes of improving the ability to estimate SOC stocks.\n\n\nThe team's previous research suggested that readily available spatial information in public databases could improve the efficiency of SOC sampling in agricultural fields. This study, led by ASC's Eric Potash, a Research Scientist in the Department of Natural Resource & Environmental Sciences (NRES) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, tested that hypothesis in eight fields across Illinois and Nebraska.\n\n\nMeasuring SOC is challenging due to its variability. The SOC stock at two locations just a few feet apart can differ significantly. This means that many locations need to be sampled to estimate the total SOC stock, which translates to a lot of work in the lab and in the field.\n\n\n\"Past studies, including one that we did one year ago, proposed ways of reducing the number of samples needed,\" Potash said. \"But it was unknown just how much more efficient those methods were. We put those methods to the test using a new high-quality dataset our research team put together.\"\n\n\nThe team found that SOC stocks in agricultural fields can be more efficiently measured by using a method called doubly balanced sampling, which accounts for auxiliary information available in elevation maps, satellite images, and previous surveys. Doubly balanced sampling is a modern strategy that improves on the classic method of stratified sampling by selecting locations that are more representative of the field in terms of this auxiliary information.\n\n\n\"Quantifying soil carbon stock through soil sampling is a hard and expensive task, but our approach was found to reduce the number of soil samples needed by a very promising 30 percent,\" said Kaiyu Guan, project lead and coauthor, Founding Director of ASC, and NRES Associate Professor. \"We believe this is a significant advancement for improving soil sampling efficiency and should be promoted in future practices by carbon project developers or researchers.\"\n\n\nThe work is made possible by unique field-level, high-resolution soil samples collected by scientists from different projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\"I am glad that our hard work and collected soil sampling data enables the development of this approach,\" said DoKyoung Lee, another coauthor and a Professor of Crop Sciences at the U of I.\n\n\nThe team has made its methods and data publicly available so that the scientific community can benefit from, and collaborate on, further improving the understanding of SOC.\n\n\n\"I am especially excited that we are publicly sharing the data for this study,\" Potash said. \"I hope that this will foster increased collaboration to accelerate progress on soil carbon research.\"\n\n\nIn addition to Potash, Guan, and Lee, co-authors on this publication include Andrew Margenot, Crop Sciences Associate Professor and ASC Associate Director; Arvid Boe, Professor of Agronomy, Horticulture & Plant Science at South Dakota State University; Michael Douglass, ASC and Crop Sciences Research Technician; Emily Heaton, Professor of Crop Sciences; Chunhwa Jang, Crop Sciences Postdoctoral Researcher; Virginia Jin, USDA-ARS Research Soil Scientist at University of Nebraska; Nan Li, ASC and Crop Sciences Postdoctoral Research Associate; Rob Mitchell, USDA Research Agronomist and Adjunct Professor of Agronomy at University of Nebraska; Nictor Namoi, ASC and Crop Sciences Graduate Research Assistant ; Marty Schmer, USDA-ARS Research Agronomist at University of Nebraska; Sheng Wang, ASC and NRES Research Assistant Professor; and Colleen Zumpf, Bioenergy and Ecosystem Services Specialist at Argonne National Laboratory.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "A new study conducted by the Agroecosystem Sustainability Center (ASC) has found that measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in agricultural fields can be done more efficiently by using a method called doubly balanced sampling.

The ISSB standard requires exclusive use of GHG Protocol for quantification of GHG emissions and removals.*\n\n\n*Requiring the GHG Protocol will be burdensome for the agricultural sector, and will create disincentives for land-based sequestration and associated carbon offsets if the current draft GHG Protocol Land Sector and Removals Guidance is not substantially revised in the final version.*\n\n\n* To read the proposed legislation [click here](https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-06/c2023-402245.pdf), to read the Cattle Australia submission [click here](https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-04/c2022-314397-cattle-australia.pdf) and the read the MLA submission [click here](https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-04/c2022-314397-meat-livestock-australia.pdf).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n### HAVE YOUR SAY  [Cancel Reply](/news/concerns-govt-proposal-could-mean-mandatory-climate-disclosure-for-farmers/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

More affluent households able to afford upfront costs for solar panels and other improvements can get Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.  \n\n  \n\nBurford pointed out her team is creating partnerships with nonprofits and local governments to make it possible for people traditionally left out of large-scale federal investments, including people of color and low-income families, to switch to clean energy and lower their utility bills.  \n\n  \n\nThe world's leading climate scientists have warned climate pollution needs to be cut by 45% by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050, to avoid catastrophic impacts of a warming planet.  \n\n  \n\nBurford noted credit unions are in a unique position to get solutions into homes, but more investments at the federal level will be necessary to address the scale of the challenge.  \n\n  \n\n\"We're doing a lot of training with other credit unions, other organizations on how they can develop programs like this, how they can partner with different organizations as well,\" Burford stressed. \"Because no one organization can do it alone.\"  \n\n  \n\nBurford added her credit union has invested more than $200 million so far in clean energy and other green loans for member households across the country. The investment has offset more than 800,000 tons of carbon dioxide, roughly the same as taking 161,000 gas-powered vehicles off the road.  \n\n  \n\n\"We actually have a carbon offset calculator on our website as well,\" Burford stated. \"If you are opening an account with us, you can put in the average amount of dollars that you'll have in your account and you can see how much you are helping to offset. So it kind of personalizes it to each individual.\"\n \n   \n  \n\n  \n\n[get more stories like this via email](/dn2.php)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n*By Katherine Rapin for [Nexus Media News](https://nexusmedianews.com/climate-conversation-groups/).  \nBroadcast version by Suzanne Potter for California News Service reporting for the Solutions Journalism Network-Public News Service Collaboration*  \n\n  \n\nIn 2020, artist Nicole Cooper was conducting research for a [painting series](https://www.nicolecooperartist.com/paintings) when she stumbled upon a NASA [chart](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/) showing temperature rise throughout history. \"I had this realization of, 'Look at *how fast* temperatures are rising - and what are we going to do about it*?\"* she said.  \n  \n\nCooper experienced what she described as an [existential crisis](https://nexusmedianews.com/how-to-cope-with-climate-anxiety/), feeling terrified of what would happen in her lifetime and worried that it may already be too late to act.  \n  \n\n\"I needed to be able to *talk*,\" she said, \"and express myself about the emotional reaction I was having.\"   \n  \n\nClimate change wasn't something she felt she could discuss deeply with the people in her life, as is the case for most Americans. Though [most people acknowledge climate change is real](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/18/for-earth-day-key-facts-about-americans-views-of-climate-change-and-renewable-energy/#:~:text=A%20majority%20of%20Americans%20(61,impact%20in%20their%20own%20community.), and about [30% say they are \"very worried\"](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/climate-change-american-mind-beliefs-attitudes-spring-2023.pdf) about it, just 37% say they discuss the issue occasionally or often, according to a [2022 survey](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-beliefs-attitudes-december-2022/toc/10/) from Yale University.  \n  \n\nBut talking about climate change is important. Researchers have found it can cause [greater acceptance](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=-G8LZA8AAAAJ&citation_for_view=-G8LZA8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC) of climate science and, among those who already accept the science, inspire action. That, in turn, has been shown to [decrease climate anxiety](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02735-6).  \n  \n\nLike so many Americans, Cooper felt scared, stressed - and largely alone. \"I was reading a lot of articles, listening to podcasts, but I had no real dialogue about it,\" she said. Then she heard about the [All We Can Save Circles](https://www.allwecansave.earth/circles), an initiative created by [Katharine Wilkinson](https://www.kkwilkinson.com/), who co-edited an anthology book of the same name. Launched when the book was published in 2020, the Circle is a decentralized, 10-course book club aimed at helping readers develop communities around climate solutions.   \n  \n\nCooper realized she could create a space for the conversations she wanted to have. Using her [newsletter](https://www.nicolecooperartist.com/email-updates), word of mouth and social media, Cooper recruited a group of nine people - some climate activists, others, like her, newer to the conversation - to meet virtually. Over the next six months, they discussed ways they were experiencing the climate crisis and created a shared [climate resource list](https://www.allwecansave.earth/emotions), including ways they could take action in their own communities.  \n  \n\n\"Coming together with people who had all kinds of emotions and to see them still [taking] climate action - daily, weekly or monthly - that was really inspiring,\" Cooper said.   \n  \n\nCooper is part of a growing movement of Americans who are seeking out solace - and power in numbers - in climate conversation groups. More than 3,000 people have formed All We Can Save Circles, according to the All We Can Save Project. The [Good Grief Network](https://www.goodgriefnetwork.org/), a nonprofit peer support network [modeled](https://www.goodgriefnetwork.org/10steps/) on 12-step addiction programs, has more than 50 climate support groups nationwide. [Climate Awakening](https://climateawakening.org/about/), founded by climate psychologist Margaret Klein Salamon, convenes small group conversations online that anyone [can join](https://app.voicevoice.com/register/climateconversation) for free.  \n  \n\nThese are all aimed at reversing what researchers describe as the \"[spiral of silence](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-spiral-silence-america/)\" around climate change.  \n  \n\n\"We know that humans avoid uncomfortable emotions,\" said Sarah Schwartz, associate professor of psychology at Suffolk University who researches climate anxiety. She explained that climate change is stressful in ways direct (not being able to breathe the air in your city, for example) and indirect (like constant worry about an uncertain future).   \n  \n\n\"But when we talk about grief processing [or] trauma - we need to turn *towards* rather than away from these hard emotions,\" she added.  \n  \n\nSchwartz co-authored a 2022 [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-02735-6) that found that collective climate action may mitigate climate distress. But, she said, \"If you just jump into action and don't make any space for conversations, support and sitting with the uncomfortable emotions - that's a recipe for burnout.\"  \n  \n\nConversations, support and collective action all require building community, which is key in addressing challenges that seem insurmountable, Schwartz said. \"The role of relationships and social support is huge in the difference between 'we can do something' and 'let's all just hunker down and isolate in our own anxiety and paralysis,'\" she said.  \n  \n\nAccording to an internal 2023 survey conducted by the All We Can Save Project, 89% of Circle participants reported feeling an increased sense of community and 90% said they took climate action, such as switching to climate-focused careers, after joining a conversation group.   \n  \n\nFor Inemesit Williams, former co-leader of the social justice working group at [Climate Action Network for International Educators](https://canie.org/about-canie) (CANIE), being part of a Circle inspired her to advocate for public transit funding and spread awareness about local bus routes. \"I've never owned a car - I've always taken public transit, ridden my bicycle, walked, carpooled,\" she said. \"So that's something I'm really passionate about: transit equity.\"   \n  \n\nWilliams, who identifies as \"a queer, Black American descendant of chattel slavery,\" said she was the only participant in her Circle who identifies as Black. It's a problem, she said, that is reflective of the broader [lack of diversity](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/15/us/environmental-groups-mostly-white-trnd/index.html) among leadership at environmental organizations.   \n  \n\nWilliams was familiar with most of the members in her Circle and felt comfortable talking about the ways the climate crisis disproportionately impacts communities of color. \"I already had a feeling of safety with this group,\" she said, but added that her experience might be an exception. \"You can't really engage in that kind of space if you don't feel like what you have to say is going to be welcome.\"  \n  \n\nCreating that safe space is why psychotherapist Taryn Crosby, who is also Black, co-organized [We Outside](https://www.somewheregood.com/gatherings/), a climate conversation specifically for Black women and non-binary people.  \n  \n\n\"We want to create a space where our experiences are prioritized,\" she said, adding that generations of trauma in nature due to slavery and lynchings, segregated state and national parks and economic oppression have pushed and [excluded many Black Americans](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-nature-gap/) from the outdoors.  \n  \n\nShe said she hopes We Outside helps attendees understand and value their own connections to nature, and prepares them to take part in broader conversations and influence greater climate action.  \n  \n\n\"Because we haven't felt necessarily welcomed or invited into other climate conversations, we kind of need this to build that muscle,\" she said. \"And that can equip us to have these conversations before mixed company.\"  \n  \n\nLeaders from the All We Can Save Project and Good Grief Network, two of the largest climate conversation networks, acknowledged that the majority of participants are white and said they were currently taking steps - including partnering with Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC)-led organizations and aiming to train more BIPOC facilitators - to diversify their ranks.  \n  \n\n\"As we think about plans for addressing diversity and inclusion in Circles - across the Project and climate movement broadly - we think partnerships, intentional outreach and relationship-building are vital,\" said Amy Curtis, learning and community lead of the All We Can Save Project.  \n  \n\nCrosby said she hopes initiatives like We Outside will be a starting point for more inclusive conversations about climate change. The goal, she said, is to hold space \"where people can be open and curious about the way that they are affected by their environment and nature, and [also] how *they* affect their environment and nature-ultimately encouraging them to move that into action.\"  \n  \n\n  \n\n*Katherine Rapin wrote this article for [Nexus Media News](https://nexusmedianews.com/).*\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n[get more stories like this via email](/dn2.php)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSmoke from Canadian wildfires this summer has permeated not only New England's air, but the performing arts.   \n\n  \n\nThe Loom Ensemble - an interdisciplinary theater company - aims to examine the intersections of public health and social justice in its new work, \"[Tell Me How You Breathe](https://www.loomensemble.com/product/tell-me-how-you-breathe-performance-july-22/).\"   \n\n  \n\nProducer and Company Co-founder Raphael Sacks said the piece tackles the unevenly distributed impacts of climate change on who gets to breathe freely, and fully.   \n\n  \n\n\"These questions of how climate catastrophe and racial justice intersect in the lungs,\" said Sacks, \"still feel like necessary questions of our time.\"  \n\n  \n\nSacks said performing in Vermont during the recent catastrophic flooding brings greater immediacy to the work, and that youth climate activists will participate in some performances.   \n\n  \n\nThe diverse Loom Ensemble plans to bring Tell Me How You Breathe [to venues throughout Vermont, Massachusetts and New York](https://www.loomensemble.com/events/) this summer.  \n\n  \n\nThe performance isn't just a spectator sport - according to Sacks - who explained audiences will not only be asked to \"lean into\" the often uncomfortable subjects of climate change and racial justice, but to participate in the performance as well.  \n\n  \n\n\"The show is woven throughout with gentle invitations to participate,\" said Sacks, \"to learn the songs that are being sung onstage, and to stand up out of your seat and move if you feel inspired.\"  \n\n  \n\nSacks said through playful storytelling, dance and music, the audience is allowed a space to grieve for the climate.   \n\n  \n\nAs a young parent himself, he said, one role in the performance is a parent imagining the future his daughter will inherit.

The warmest global temperatures in decades are clearly reflected in northwest Montana's lakes, rivers and streams, and the areas affected by drought are increasing.  \n\n  \n\nNowhere is it more evident than in the [Flathead Lake](https://www.visitmt.com/listings/general/lake/flathead-lake) basin.  \n\n  \n\nBrian Lipscomb, CEO of Energy Keepers, an organization monitoring water levels on behalf of the [Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes](https://csktribes.org/), said people are feeling the effect of last winter's snowpack, which was only 70% of normal.   \n\n  \n\n\"Down 30%, that's really not normal for us,\" Lipscomb pointed out. \"That water supply coming into the lake is the lowest in the 74-year record.\"  \n\n  \n\nLipscomb added an unusually cold winter added to the dry conditions in northwest Montana because the lack of snow reduced snowmelt and runoff into the river basin, which set the stage for even drier conditions now.   \n\n  \n\nWhile much of the focus has been on the record heat in western states, Lipscomb noted the worst effects of drought do not happen in one year, or even in five or 10, but multiply and accumulate.  \n\n  \n\n\"You have to see drought in western Montana over the course of time,\" Lipscomb contended. \"It's snowpack, it's when is our winter due, it's what is happening with rainfall. It's what's our soil moisture content. It's what's the water supplies in the rivers.\"  \n\n  \n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the snowpack in Montana [melted faster](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/quicklinks/states/montana/daily/basinDaily/kootenai) than it has in 30 years.\n \n   \n  \n\n  \n\n[get more stories like this via email](/dn2.php)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](https://www.newsservice.org/getimage.php?p=dGh1bWJ3aWR0aD01MjUmc2dpZD04NTU4OCZzaWQ9MQ==)Conversation groups about climate change are part of a new strategy to motivate people to take action.

Check out these briefs for the latest insights on pressing trends and events impacting markets, published every other week. [Registration required](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/climate-markets-update-from-carbon-pulse.html)*\n\n\n***INTERNATIONAL***\n\n\n**Still a lot of money \u2013** BP\u2019s second-quarter profit slumped 70% from a year earlier to $2.6 bln, missing forecasts, as refining margins and oil trading income fell, but still allowing the energy giant to boost its dividend by 10%, [Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bp-boosts-dividend-even-profit-slumps-70-26-bln-2023-08-01/). Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies [have also reported sharp drops](https://carbon-pulse.com/214229/) in quarterly earnings, due to a drop in energy prices from highs hit following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine a year and a half ago.\n\n\n**Amazon guarantees** \u2013 Brazil will push the EU for better trading terms in return for offering environmental guarantees over protection of the Amazon rainforest, said a diplomat with knowledge of the EU-Mercosur trade deal negotiations, [as reported by Climate Home News](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/08/01/brazil-mercosur-amazon-eu-trade/). EU negotiators included a \u201cside letter\u201d this year to the trade deal originally struck in 2019, adding environmental guarantees to the original accord in order to prevent against a relapse of environmental protection in the Amazon. The new Brazilian government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, which has made bold pledges to environmental protection, has taken its time to come up with a response. South American trade bloc Mercosur is expected to prepare its counterproposal this week before meeting with EU negotiators in August in the hopes of closing the accord by the end of the year. Brazil diplomats have complained that the new rules go beyond the Paris climate agreement.\n\n\n***EMEA***\n\n\n**Common understanding \u2013** The European Commission has set important framework conditions for planned German state support to build and operate about 24 GW hydrogen power plants and fossil gas units, which will later be converted to hydrogen, the economy ministry said. The ministry and Commission have worked out a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d for support to build such gas-fired power plants, which the government considers a necessary supplement to intermittent renewables to secure the electricity supply. ([Clean Energy Wire](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/eu-sets-state-support-conditions-german-gas-and-hydrogen-power-plants-econ-min))\n\n\n**Climate pricing** \u2013 Linking the pricing of products to their climate impact is the idea behind a week-long experiment at a leading discount supermarket in Germany, [reports the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/31/german-supermarket-penny-trial-climate-cost-food-meat-cheese). The experiment will see all 2,150 branches of the Penny chain increase the prices of a selection of products, mainly dairy and meat, in relation to their effect on soil, climate, water use and health. The campaign has seen the price of wiener sausages rise from \u20ac3.19 to \u20ac6.01, mozzarella go up by 74% to \u20ac1.55, and fruit yoghurt increase by 31% from \u20ac1.19 to \u20ac1.56. The experiment is being led in partnership with academics from the Nuremberg Institute of Technology and the University of Greifswald and is intended to help raise consumer awareness of the true environmental impact of certain foods. Excess proceeds made from the sales will be donated to charity Zukunftsbauer or Future Farmer, which supports family-run farms in Alpine regions, many of which are struggling amid low returns.\n\n\n**French resilience** \u2013 France has submitted a second request to the European Commission for approval for a payment of over \u20ac10 bln under the recovery and resilience plan, as part of the NextGenerationEU fund set up for member states recovery following the pandemic. The funding will go to investments like renovating buildings to improve their energy performance and retraining or upskilling the workforce. The entire French recovery and resilience plan consists of 20 reforms and 71 investments that will be supported by \u20ac39.4 bln in grants, some 46% of which will support climate objectives and 21% will foster the digital transition.\n\n\n***ASIA PACIFIC***\n\n\n**Serious threat**\u2013 UN scientific advisors have recommended the Great Barrier Reef not be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger, but stressed coral reef system remains under \u2018serious threat\u2019 from global heating and water pollution, [the Guardian reports](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/01/climate-crisis-great-barrier-reef-unesco-australia). UNESCO said in a report that the Australian government had taken positive steps to protect the reef since a UN monitoring mission visited Queensland in March last year. But UNESCO has essentially put Australia on notice, recommending the government provide a progress report in February, before the reef is reconsidered to be put on the \u2018in danger\u2019 list again in 2024. The Australian government said the report was confirmation it was acting on climate change.\n\n\n**Better predictions** \u2013 Japan\u2019s Chubu Electric Power has introduced the use of distribution future energy scenarios (DFES) in its power systems through the collaboration with the Mitsubishi Research Institute, in a bid to better formulate plans for power transmission and distribution facilities that support carbon neutrality, according to a statement released this week. The Japanese power company will use the newly developed DFES to improve demand forecasting based on the characteristics of each region and utilise distributed energy resources, such as solar and battery storage, it said.\n\n\n**Nuclear expansion** \u2013 China has given the green light to several expansion projects at three existing nuclear plants amid rising concerns over energy security, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-approves-expansions-three-nuclear-power-plants-2023-08-01/) reports, citing a statement from the State Council. Six new power generation units have been approved to expand the capacity of existing nuclear facilities in provinces including Shandong, Fujian, and Liaoning, with a total investment of around 120 bln yuan ($16.74 bln), according to Chinese-language media outlet [The Paper](https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_24058509).\n\n\n**Public call** \u2013 South Korea\u2019s environment ministry has issued a public call to encourage more companies to participate in the \u2018Green Industry Alliance,\u2019 as part of the government\u2019s support for overseas expansion of the domestic green industry, according to an official notice published Tuesday. The ministry plans to hold an alliance meeting around mid-August and operate specific meetings in the second half of the year to develop strategies tailored to each company, it said. More than 30 participants, including engineering firms and financial institutions, have joined the alliance.\n\n\n***AMERICAS***\n\n\n**Utility opposition \u2013** Investor-owned utility lobby group Edison Electric Institute (EEI) will oppose the US EPA\u2019s plan to mandate large natural gas-fired plants to begin using carbon capture by 2035, or co-fire with 30% hydrogen by 2032, [Reuters reported](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-us-utility-group-opposes-emissions-plan-for-existing-gas-plants-source-0) Tuesday. The EEI supplies power to 250 mln Americans, making it the largest group of utilities in the country. Space constraints for carbon capture facilities are among the issues the EEI has with the plan. The group has until Aug. 8 to submit public comment.\n\n\n**A little bit longer \u2013** A coal-fired unit at a Texas power station, expected to host a carbon capture project that was shuttered in 2020, [will return to service](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/restart-delayed-texas-coal-unit-linked-petra-nova-ccs-project-2023-08-01/) in late August, months later than originally planned, the utility NRG said on Tuesday. Unit 8 at the WA Parish plant in Richmond, Texas closed after a fire in May 2022. NRG brought back the 600-MW unit for several days last week in test mode and now expects it to return in late August after originally planning to restart it in late June. The coal unit had hosted the $1 bln Petra Nova CCS plant, which sent the CO2 gas about 80 miles (130 km) by pipeline where it was pumped into an aging oilfield to boost output. NRG shut Petra Nova on May 1, 2020, citing a plunge in oil prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. JX Nippon, a Japanese energy company, is now the sole owner of Petra Nova after buying NRG\u2019s share last year. JX Nippon has said previously that the CCS plant will start up once Unit 8 resumes service. (Reuters)\n\n\n**Green gas \u2013** Renewable fuel firm Verde Clean Fuels is entering an agreement with a Brookfield Renewable-affiliated carbon capture outfit, Carbon TerraVault, according to press release on Tuesday. Brookfield and the California Resources Corporation run Carbon TerraVault as a partnership, and Verde will build a renewable gasoline facility on California Resources Corporation\u2019s land under the agreement. As much as 100,000 tCO2 is expected to get captured at Verde\u2019s facility every year, producing 21,000 gal (79,493 litres) of renewable gasoline per day.\n\n\n***VOLUNTARY***\n\n\n**Loomis left \u2013**\u00a0$310 bln Natixis affiliate Loomis Sayles has become the [latest asset manager to distance itself](https://citywire.com/selector/news/loomis-sayles-exits-climate-action-100-citing-financial-reasons/a2422880) from ESG-related investment practices as it leaves the Climate Action 100+ initiative \u201cas a result of our routine evaluations to ensure that all our industry commitments continue to be aligned with the firm\u2019s ESG philosophy\u201d a company spokesperson said. The departure from the pro-ESG initiative comes about six months after Vanguard left a similar group, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, citing \u2018confusion\u2019 and left amid a time of increasing scrutiny and criticism of ESG from US Republican politicians. (CityWire)\n\n\n**Voluminous venture \u2013** Energy and transportation firm US Venture has committed to becoming carbon neutral by the end of 2024 using carbon credits that meet CORSIA and CME Group\u2019s Global Emissions Offset criteria, as well as RECs, according to the company\u2019s [sustainability report](https://www.usventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/USV-Sustainability-Report-2022.pdf) released Tuesday. Carbon neutrality for the company will apply to Scope 1 and 2 emissions during Financial Year 2023, and it will purchase carbon credits and other environmental products by the end of the following year. US Venture\u2019s Scope 1-2 emissions totalled 77,100 tonnes in FY 2022, though it did not report Scope 3 output from the products it sells.\n\n\n***INVESTMENT***\n\n\n**Millions for methane** \u2013 Methane detection startup SensorUp has raised C$12 mln ($9 mln) in a Series B fundraise [round](https://betakit.com/oil-and-gas-backed-climate-investment-leads-12-million-cad-round-into-sensorups-methane-leak-detecting-platform/), led by Climate Investment and with participation from BC-based Evok Innovations. The new funds are intended to accelerate the development and sales of SensorUp\u2019s gas emissions management solution. The Calgary-based company, founded in 2012, helps oil and gas companies to be compliant with international standards around methane through its data-integration platform for methane leak detection and repair, measurement reconciliation, reporting, and verification of methane emissions. Climate Investment was founded by OGCI, an organisation of energy and oil and gas CEOs.\n\n\n***AND FINALLY\u2026***\n\n\n**Space sunshade** \u2013 Using a huge sunshade to lower the intensity of sunlight reaching the earth, paired with an asteroid acting as a counterweight to balance gravitational forces, has been proposed as a method to counteract climate change by an astronomer from the University of Hawaii\u2019s Institute for Astronomy. The calculations were done with the goal of curtailing solar radiation by 1.7%, the amount scientists believe is necessary to avert \u2018disastrous\u2019 global temperature increases. The researchers theorised that a tethered counterbalance facing the sun could minimise the weight of the shield to around 3.5 Mt, which is almost 100 times lighter than former estimates of an untethered shield.

he cares about reaching net zero but that the 2050 target needs to be achieved in \"a proportionate and pragmatic way\".** \n\nThe prime minister has faced criticism from environmental groups and some of his own MPs that he is not committed to tackling climate change. \n\nMr Sunak told LBC he wanted to leave the environment in \"a better state than we found it in\" for his two daughters. \n\nBut he added that the UK would still need fossil fuels in the future.\n\nAsked if he was confident he could win over his environmentally conscious daughters, Mr Sunak said they were not \"eco-zealots\" and like most people, were \"open to sensible, practical arguments\". \n\nHe has previously described his daughters as \"passionate environmentalists\", who have often asked him what he is doing about climate change.\n\n* [What does net zero mean?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58874518)\n* [Rishi Sunak: Bans not right approach to net zero](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66335627)\nMr Sunak is facing pressure from some Conservative MPs to review the government's green policies, after the party's surprise win in the Uxbridge by-election, [when it capitalised on anger over London's Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66264893). \n\nHowever, he has said the government is committed to reaching net zero by 2050 - which means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are increasing global temperatures.\n\nDomestic flights\n----------------\n\nOther leading climate campaigners in the Conservative Party have criticised Mr Sunak's commitment to environmental issues. \n\nLord Goldsmith [recently resigned from the government](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66063894), accusing the prime minister of \"apathy\" over climate change.\n\nThe prime minister has also attracted criticism for the number of domestic flights he has taken to travel for government business across the UK. \n\nEarlier this week he defended flying to Scotland, to announce support for a carbon capture project, as \"an efficient use of time for the person running the country\".\n\n\"If your approach to climate change is to say that no one should go on holiday, no one should go on a plane, I think you are completely and utterly wrong,\" he told BBC's Good Morning Scotland.\n\nIn his interview with LBC he also revealed he was taking his family on a summer holiday to California this week, including a visit to Disneyland. \n\nThis video can not be played\n\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMedia caption, The prime minister is due to head on a family holiday this Thursday\n\nMr Sunak has announced the government is [granting 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-66354478), as well as supporting a carbon capture project in the north east of Scotland. \n\nThe decision was criticised by environmental campaigners, who said it would \"send a wrecking ball through the UK's climate commitments\".\n\nConservative MP Chris Skidmore said the move was \"the wrong decision at precisely the wrong time\" and \"on the wrong side of history\". \n\nHowever, Mr Sunak said: \"I 100% believe that what I'm doing is right,\" adding that even after meeting the 2050 target the UK would still need fossil fuels. \n\nHe argued it was \"sensible\" to use \"the energy we have here at home\", as this would be better for jobs and avoid the environmental cost of shipping energy from abroad, as well as reducing the UK's reliance on other countries. \n\nElectric cars\n-------------\n\nMeanwhile, Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps is meeting oil and gas bosses in Downing Street to talk about the government's decision to invest in home-grown energy sources, including renewables and North Sea oil and gas. \n\nMr Sunak is also facing pressure over measures to move towards electric cars. \n\nBusiness Secretary Kemi Badenoch is understood to have raised concerns about rules due to come into effect next year that require car manufacturers to sell a certain proportion of electric models.\n\nFrom January, 22% of vehicles sold have to be zero emission, or car makers could be hit with fines. \n\nSome manufacturers have been calling for a softening of the rules, and [as first reported by the Politico website](https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-electric-vehicles-zero-emission-threat-government-rules-business-trade-secretary-kemi-badenoch), Ms Badenoch has passed on their concerns to her cabinet colleagues. \n\nBut Labour said the sector was \"crying out for certainty\" and Ms Badenoch's reported comments were a \"threat to investment\". \n\nMinisters have insisted the government [remains committed to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66301051), despite calls from some Tory MPs for a delay. \n\nRelated

That inevitably runs counter to climate change goals, which have taken on [new significance as heat waves](https://www.axios.com/2023/07/27/july-hottest-month-global-climate-record) swamp much of the world.\n\n* The Sunak government insists that more drilling is compatible with the country's 2050 net zero emissions target.\n\n**The big picture:** Spiking energy prices acutely impacted the U.K. after Russia invaded Ukraine last year.\n\n* Sunak is framing the move as key to the country's energy security, while also claiming that North Sea-produced gas is far less carbon intensive than imported liquefied natural gas.\n* Since the U.K.'s oil and gas production has been falling quickly, the new developments would arrest the decline, a [government statement said](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hundreds-of-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-to-boost-british-energy-independence-and-grow-the-economy-31-july-2023), rather than leading to a net production increase.\n* Climate activists and [scientists](https://pdpwbj.clicks.mlsend.com/te/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjI0OTYxNyxcImxcIjo5NTI5MzYzMzEzNDA2OTI5OCxcInJcIjo5NTI5MzY1NzIyOTI5NzE5MX0iLCJzIjoiNTEyYjEyM2U1NTZjNTk3YiJ9) are [slamming the new drilling plans](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66354478) as sending a \"wrecking ball\" through the U.K.'s climate goals.\n\n**Zoom in:** On climate and energy issues, the U.K. has parallels with the U.S. and Australia, with the three allies each playing host to robust climate change contrarian movements.\n\n* National governments have see-sawed between aggressive climate objectives, and fossil fuel-friendly administrations.\n\n**What they're saying:** \"Even when we've reached net zero in 2050, a quarter of our energy needs will come from oil and gas,\" [Sunak said in a statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hundreds-of-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-to-boost-british-energy-independence-and-grow-the-economy-31-july-2023).\n\n**Flashback:** When the UK hosted COP26 in Glasgow, then-prime minister Boris Johnson positioned the country at the forefront of climate action.\n\n**The big picture:** Now Sunak's government, [battered in the polls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-29/sunak-gambles-with-lurch-to-right-as-uk-moderates-flee-to-labour?sref=Oz9Q3OZU&utm_source=cbnewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=2023-07-31&utm_campaign=Daily+Briefing+31+07+2023), is taking a different approach to energy transition, betting that voters will reward him and his Conservative party.\n\n* \"We're going to do that in a proportionate and pragmatic a way that doesn't unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their lives,\" Sunak told reporters last week about his approach to net zero.\n* The government is reportedly considering [modifying a planned 2030 ban](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-28/britain-is-back-pedaling-on-boris-climate-legacy?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTY5MDUzNDk5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjkxMTM5Nzk5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJSWUhONEJEV0xVNjgwMSIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJERTAzOTRCQ0VBQUU0MTY4QThCMEM0QjRFQzJGOTA1NCJ9.mmpviBSoweRf2GQ3gLZ0Xhff5IIOoZUQLs77nw4BbdI&sref=Oz9Q3OZU&utm_source=cbnewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=2023-07-31&utm_campaign=Daily+Briefing+31+07+2023) on the sale of new gasoline and diesel powered cars. Other measures to decarbonize homes and transportation are reportedly under review, too.\n* Meanwhile, Sunak's rival Labour Party has endorsed a ban on new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea.\n\n**Context:** Studies show the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly and steeply, [reaching net zero emissions by midcentury](https://www.axios.com/2022/04/04/un-climate-panel-calls-for-renewables-shift) in order to have a chance of limiting climate change's severity below potentially catastrophic levels.\n\n**Yes, but:** So far, countries are [nowhere close to being on that path](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/26/climate-change-pledges-paris-targets-un).\n\nShare on facebook (opens in new window)Share on twitter (opens in new window)Share on linkedin (opens in new window)Share on email (opens in new window)##### Go deeper\n\n[![Sareen Habeshian](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.axios.com%2Fimg%2Fauthor-default.png&w=320&q=75)](https://www.axios.com/authors/shabeshian)* [Sareen Habeshian](https://www.axios.com/authors/shabeshian)\n* [Sophia Cai](https://www.axios.com/authors/scai)\n\nUpdated 1 min ago - [Politics & Policy](https://www.axios.com/politics-policy)[Trump pleads not guilty to all charges in federal Jan. 6 case](/2023/08/03/trump-indictment-arraignment-jan-6-updates)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Trump pleads not guilty to all charges in federal Jan. 6 case](/2023/08/03/trump-indictment-arraignment-jan-6-updates)![Former U.S. President Donald Trump holds an umbrella as he arrives at Reagan National Airport following an arraignment in a Washington, D.C. court on August 3, 2023 in Arlington, Virginia. ](https://images.axios.com/OYukR1BPi9TNNvYxxlADink37DE=/0x136:3000x1824/1920x1080/2023/08/03/1691097701691.jpg?w=1920)Former U.S. President Donald Trump holds an umbrella as he arrives at Reagan National Airport following an arraignment in a Washington, D.C. court on August 3, 2023 in Arlington, Virginia.

The escalating environmental crisis underscores the urgent need for manufacturers to reform their practices for the planet. Guided by CEO Bob King and Chief Sustainability Officer Jane Abernethy, Humanscale's comprehensive sustainability program remains unwavering in its commitment to a planet positive, not just net zero, environmental impact by creating \"handprints\" and reducing carbon footprints.\n\n\n\n\"As always,\u00a0Humanscale's success in sustainability is measured not by our promises, but by the measurable actions we've already taken. Our goal is to pioneer new ways of operating sustainably, not just for us, but for the entire industry,\" says King.\n\n\nIn its 2022\u00a0CSR report, Humanscale outlines its progress in six categories: climate & energy, healthy materials, circularity, water, wildlife preservation, and social responsibility. All categories demonstrate Humanscale's environmental leadership across the industry.\n\n**Climate & Energy**\n\nIn 2022, Humanscale made a groundbreaking stride in climate action as the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) approved their ambitious emission reduction targets. Aligned with cutting-edge climate science to confine global warming to well below 1.5\u00b0 C (2.7\u00b0 F) by 2030, Humanscale has set Scope 1 & 2 reduction targets along with a Scope 3 supplier engagement target, meeting the SBTi's stringent standards.\n\nUsing advanced analytics,\u00a0Humanscale continually examines and reduces its energy use. As of 2022, Humanscale's absolute energy reduction reaches 50 megajoules across all factories, and 47% of Humanscale's electricity comes from renewable sources, demonstrating their commitment to meeting the SBTi. Humanscale keeps careful track of the energy they use during production and continuously looks for ways to use less.\n\n**Healthy Materials**\n\nHumanscale continues its mission to eliminate Red-List chemicals, often found in coatings, finishes, and additives. The company has already eliminated chemicals like Chrome 6 and PFAS and continues to set goals to make its products without harmful toxins. Understanding the importance of consumer health and well-being, in 2022, the company completely eliminated halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), furthering its commitment to environmental health and consumer safety.\n\nTo help customers choose to avoid toxins,\u00a0Humanscale publicly shares all the ingredients in their products. In 2022, they continued to lead the furniture industry in materials transparency. 100% of new Humanscale products are launched with an ingredients label, 83% of Declare Labels have been verified by a third-party auditor, and 81% of Humanscale products are sold with materials ingredients labels.\n\n**Circularity**\n\nHumanscale's global waste diversion rate reached 94% in 2022, surpassing the target of 91%. All Humanscale factories are TRUE\u00ae Zero Waste certified and are third-party audited to ensure each one diverts at least 90% of waste away from landfills, the environment, and incineration. Humanscale can't simply burn the waste instead of sending it to a landfill - they must find ways to use it. And on top of that, each factory must improve by 1% every year.\u00a0\n\n**Water**\n\nAs water is a critical natural resource,\u00a0Humanscale regularly looks for ways to reduce consumption and uses natural rain harvesting for 100% of production in all factories globally. In most cases, their production water is used in a closed-loop system and continually reused, with additional water input to the system mainly from evaporative loss. In 2022, Humanscale made progress towards its goal of reducing overall water use for production at their factories by 25%. A new engineering system, which will be installed in 2023, will assist in meeting this goal.\n\n**Wildlife Preservation**\n\nThe successful launch of the Path chair, made with five times more ocean plastic than any other task chair, signals the brand's ongoing dedication to cleaner oceans.\n\nFishing gear is the most harmful kind of ocean plastic since the fishing nets continue to \"ghost fish,\" needlessly ensnaring fish, turtles, dolphins, birds, sharks, and much other wildlife. A single net can catch hundreds of animals and damage the coral reefs, and continue doing so for centuries. The nets are commonly made of nylon, a very durable material, which is a major issue when they're released in the ocean, but\u00a0Humanscale saw it could be a benefit if used in long-lasting products like their task chairs.\n\n**Social Responsibility**\n\nHumanscale's Sustainability Ambassadors lead various initiatives that offset carbon footprints and contribute positively to the environment. In 2022, the ambassadors were engaged in various community projects, including an Illinois Green Schools Project mentorship, the Kansas City vegetable gardens, and a Connecticut River cleanup. Humanscale also sponsored the installation of solar panels at three housing communities in Montclair, California, the distribution of nearly 12,000 energy-efficient CFL light bulbs to residents in New Orleans, and the installation of 6,000 trees in Mexico as part of the Monarch High Forest Restoration project. These are just a few examples of the \"handprints\" created instead of buying carbon offsets like most modern companies.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n#### Secure Your Financial Future\n\n\nHidden gems are waiting to be found in this market!

To counter this, all Humanscale supplier agreements explicitly forbid forced and child labor, supporting human rights and freedom of association. By the close of 2022, 75.6% of suppliers by spending had committed to these standards. Annually, first-tier suppliers undergo risk assessments related to labor and human rights, based on their operational type and location. In a progressive stride, Humanscale helped develop the Design for Freedom toolkit in March 2022, which was then launched in partnership with Grace Farms and architecture firms, to specify materials produced without child or forced labor.\n\n**Humanscale Pioneers Planet Positive Manufacturing**\n\nRecognizing the vast environmental impact of global manufacturing,\u00a0Humanscale is committed to transcending the role of a passive contributor to global challenges. The company sees these challenges - from wildlife extinction to climate change - as a call to action, understanding that simply mitigating the damage isn't enough. They believe that to truly make a difference, manufacturers need to actively improve the environment. It's about being planet positive, not just neutral, and the industry as a whole must follow suit. Humanscale uses its philosophy of \"handprints\" (positive change) to offset inevitable \"footprints\" (a result of direct influence through actions or in the supply chain). Drawing inspiration from nature's regenerative systems, Humanscale innovates in sourcing, manufacturing, and distributing materials, setting industry standards in prioritizing low-carbon, healthy choices, and leading manufacturing towards a sustainable future.\n\n\"When it comes to responsible manufacturing, the evidence is clear: aiming to leave a neutral impact on our environment many years in the future is simply not enough,\" says\u00a0Abernethy.\n\nSee\u00a0[here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3934864-1&h=3879064596&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humanscale.com%2Fabout%2Fcsr%2Fannual-report.cfm&a=here) for Humanscale's full 2022 CSR Report.\n\n**ABOUT\u00a0HUMANSCALE**\n\nHumanscale is the leading designer and manufacturer of high-performance ergonomic products that improve the health and comfort of work life.

Honeywell\u2019s Solstice LBA supports these objectives as an ultra-low-GWP alternative to traditional hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) such as HCFC-141b, which is banned in Saudi Arabia.  \n\n\n\n\nHCFCs are sometimes used in foam, refrigeration and air conditioning applications, but deplete the protective ozone layer and contribute to climate change. Alternative hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) solutions are also potent greenhouse gases and do not meet energy regulations.  \n\n\n\n\nWith a GWP of 1, 99.9% lower than HFC blowing agents, Solstice LBA will enable Al-Essa Industrial Company to meet energy standard requirements in Saudi Arabia and other countries for exports.  \n\n\n\n\n\u201cHoneywell\u2019s ready-now Solstice LBA plays a critical role for the manufacturing industry as we see the continued phaseout of high-GWP materials and increasing regulations on reducing emissions globally,\u201d said George Bou Mitri, vice president and general manager of Performance Materials and Technologies for the Middle East and North Africa at Honeywell. \u201cSwitching to Solstice LBA will not only support Al-Essa Industrial Company\u2019s sustainability initiatives, but will also help to accelerate the industry\u2019s transition to more environmentally-conscious and energy efficient applications of blowing agents. Through this collaboration, Al-Essa Industrial Company and Honeywell are supporting the Kingdom\u2019s initiative of building up its local manufacturing capabilities with reduced impact on the environment.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\nHoneywell has\u00a0[invested more than one billion dollars](https://sustainability.honeywell.com/us/en)\u00a0in research, development and new capacity for its Solstice technology, having anticipated the need for lower-GWP solutions to combat climate change more than a decade ago. The product line, which helps customers lower their greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency without sacrificing end-product performance, includes refrigerants for vehicle, commercial and residential air conditioning applications, heat pumps; blowing agents for insulation; aerosol propellants; solvents for cleaning solutions; and are being evaluated for use in metered-dose inhalers.  \n\n\n\n\nUse of Honeywell Solstice technology has helped avoid the potential release of the equivalent of more than 326 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, equal to the carbon emissions from nearly 70 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles per year.[1]  \n\n\n\n\n[Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/press/2021/04/honeywell-commits-to-carbon-neutrality-in-its-operations-and-facilities-by-2035)\u00a0is committed to\u00a0[achieving carbon neutrality](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/news/2021/04/how-we-will-reach-carbon-neutral-by-2035)\u00a0in its operations and facilities by 2035 and recently announced a\u00a0[new set of commitments](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/press/2022/04/honeywell-strengthens-its-sustainability-commitments-will-set-science-based-target-that-includes-scope-3-emissions)\u00a0that further advance its sustainability goals, including committing to set a science-based target with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) that will include scope 3 emissions and participation in the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Climate Challenge.

fuels\n=====================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n02 Aug 2023\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n![T&E recommends mandates for UK shipping to drive uptake of zero-emission bunker fuels](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/135.jpg)\n\n\nTransport & Environment (T&E) released a briefing paper on Monday (31 July) to support its recommendation on the use of mandates to create a market for both the supply and use of zero-emission marine fuels and achieve the required emissions reductions for Net Zero and the UK carbon budgets.\u00a0\n\n\nT&E explained UK shipping used almost 7 million tonnes of fossil marine fuel oil in 2021, and produced almost one fifth of all UK transport emissions. The government is currently considering policies to decarbonise the UK shipping sector but has yet to make any solid commitments.\n\n\nAt the level of the International Maritime Organization, the UK has endorsed a goal-based maritime emissions reduction pathway called the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). To meet the SBTi pathway will require large-scale use of zero-emission marine fuels and energy.\n\n\nIn March 2023, the UK government published assumptions for how much low-carbon shipping fuel will be required in 2035 to stay within the carbon budgets.\u00a0\n\n\nT&E calculated that meeting these assumptions with a combination of zero emission renewable e-fuels and direct electrification \u2013 the most cost-effective options \u2013 would require 44TWh renewable electricity, to produce 140,000 tonnes hydrogen, 3.1 million tonnes ammonia/methanol, and nearly 2TWh shore power. 44TWh would require an additional 1,360 8MW wind turbines.\n\n\nThe briefing showed the energy requirements for the UK of implementing five different zero emission mandate scenarios.\n\n\nEach scenario assumes fulfilment with a combination of direct electrification and green e-fuels, using 100% renewable electricity.\n\n\n![](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-02-at-11.15.06-AM.png)\n\n\n![](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-02-at-11.15.16-AM.png)\n\n\n\u201cMandates are effective instruments to drive the uptake of near-zero- and zero-emission transport fuels. The UK already uses such a mandate (the development fuels sub-target) through the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), whilst another for sustainable aviation fuel is being designed,\u201d it said in the briefing paper.\n\n\n\u201cA mandate either for zero- or near-zero-emission shipping (or specifically on shipping fuels) will certainly be necessary to create a market for both the supply and use of these fuels, and achieve the required emissions reductions for Net Zero and the UK carbon budgets.\u201d\n\n\nT&E added in addition to fulfilment of any UK zero-emission shipping mandate, further abatement will be necessary for compliance with the SBTi pathway.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThis is because, even if the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan assumptions for low-carbon marine fuel uptake for UK domestic and international shipping correlate directly to emissions reductions, a maximum of 30.5% abatement would be achieved in 2035, compared to the SBTi target of 77% reduction by the same date,\u201d it said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAdditional consideration must therefore be given not only to the low-carbon fuel uptake assumptions, but also to targets and even mandates for energy efficiency

Introduction\n \n\n\n C0.1\n \n\n\n (C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.\n \n\n\n Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL) is the largest mining and metal production company in India and world's second largest zinc-lead miner. The company was established in 1966 and is headquartered in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. HZL has more than 50 years of operational experience and gives highest priority to safety of its people and the conservation of scarce natural resources. The company has a total R&R base of 460.1 MT and an average zinc- lead grade of 7.18%. The average mine life is over 25 years. HZL's fully integrated zinc operations currently hold 80% market share in India's primary zinc industry.\n \n\n\n In addition, HZL is the 5th largest silver producer, globally, with an annual production capacity of 800 MT. HZL is a subsidiary of Vedanta Limited, which owns 64.9% stake in the Company while the Government of India retains a 29.5% stake. Currently, HZL's ore production capacity stands at 16.74 million MT per annum. The company is aggressively expanding its mining capacities, with five ongoing major underground mining operations. Our high- quality silver bullion produced at Pantnagar unit has a 99.9% purity and is listed on LBMA Good Delivered List (LGD).\n \n\n\n All our units are certified to ISO: 50001 Energy Management System. In FY 2022-23, we produced wind power of 409.26 million units, solar power of\n \n\n\n 76.16 million units, and Waste Heat Energy of 227.89 million units. With focused efforts and initiatives in expanding our green footprint, we have avoided 8.66 lakh tonnes of CO2 emissions during FY 2022-23, as against 6.13 lakh tonnes in FY 2021-22.\n \n\n\n HZL has set an ambitious target of 50% reduction in Scope 1 & Scope 2 GHG emissions, a 25% reduction in Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050 (currently these targets are under final stage of validation by SBTi). Aligned with these commitments, HZL has entered\n \n\n\n 1\n \n\n\n Hindustan Zinc CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2023 Tuesday, August 1, 2023\n \n\n\n long-term group captive renewable power delivery agreement of 200 MW & 250 MW renewable energy, round the clock (RE RTC).. To achieve net zero commitment, HZL has undertaken the following initiatives:\n \n\n* Procured 100% renewable power at Pantnagar metal plant leading to GHG emission reduction of more than 30,000 tCO2e annually.\n* Deployed India's first underground battery electric vehicle in mining operations.\n* Business partners deployed 21 electric vehicles in smelting operations (Forklifts & tow trucks).\n* Signed 200 MW & 250 MW RE power delivery agreement that will reduce GHG emissions by 2.7 Mn tCO2e by 2026.\n* Introduced group electric vehicle policy to incentivise EV use by employees.\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u2022 Implementation of energy saving initiatives that helped save\n  | \n 5,81,916 GJ of energy.\n  |\n\n* Green company (GreenCo) certifications for all our smelters and a few mining locations by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII). In FY 2022-23, HZL achieved several noteworthy climate change-related recognitions, few are as below:\n1.

However, it also underlines areas where Finlays fell short of its targets. You can see the [complete report here](https://www.finlays.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Finlays-Sustainability-Report-2022.pdf).\n\nAs a result of our efforts, below are 10 lessons learned from Finlay\u2019s recently-concluded five-year sustainability strategy, which launched in 2018 and concluded December 2022. All of these insights will certainly be of value or offer inspiration to other businesses in the industry.\n\n**Top 10 Lessons in Sustainability**\n\n**1. The Need for Focus**\n\nReflecting on our Sustainable Future strategy has shown that its scope was too broad, making it difficult to fully deliver against all six of our objectives \u2013 integrated landscape, low impact operations, land stewardship, empowered communities, our people and sustainable supply. To achieve the greatest impact we can, we must focus on the biggest issues facing our industry, the communities we serve, and the world at large.\n\n**2. The Importance of Setting Measurable Targets**\n\nWhile most of our objectives had a measurable KPI (key performance indicator), not all of them did nd that made tracking and measurement difficult. Ultimately, without the right quantitative and qualitative targets to hold us to account, it is much harder to demonstrate clear progress, and to understand where we are falling short.\n\n**3. If You Don\u2019t Measure It, Did It Happen?**\n\nLinked to this, in the early stages of our Sustainable Future strategy, we didn\u2019t track certain data points as systematically as we should have. Collecting data accurately and consistently across a wide range of different businesses in different geographies has its challenges, but is critical to understanding our impact. This is something we have been working hard to improve in the last year, ready for our new strategy, where we hope our carbon net zero ambitions will be approved by the [Science Based Targets Initiative](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) (SBTi).\n\n**4. Sustainability Innovation Can Come from Anywhere**\n\nSome of the projects we\u2019re most proud of are those which started with a small team who noticed a challenge or opportunity in the course of their role. In Argentina, for example, we\u2019ve significantly reduced agro-chemical use on our tea farms through our livestock weeding project, which sees sheep eating the weeds among the tea bushes. A great idea identified and implemented by a team at [Casa Fuentes](https://www.finlays.net/innovation/casa-fuentes-joins-the-finlays-family/). One of our focusses now is on empowering people across our business to identify challenges and innovate solutions.\n\n**5. Sustainability Is a \u201cWhole Business\u201d Endeavor**\n\nIn global agricultural industries like tea and coffee, it\u2019s tempting to focus sustainability efforts on the farming end of the supply chain. Sustainable Future did not have as much focus as it should have on the other parts of our business \u2013 tea and coffee extraction, packing, delivery etc. To truly embed sustainability across the business, the strategy needs to be relevant and engaging to all our different businesses/operations and, crucially, delivered locally.\n\n**6. The Importance of Moving with the Times**\n\nFive years is a long time in sustainability, and it\u2019s clear we could have been more agile in responding to the shifting challenges of sustainable operation. For example, while our focus on sustainable supply was a key benefit during the global supply chain crisis of 2020 and 2021, we haven\u2019t responded as ambitiously as we should have when it came to the critical challenge of climate change which is of course a major threat to tea and coffee growing regions. This is something that will be front and centre of our new strategy which launched this year.\n\n**7. The Imperative of Collaboration**\n\nNo business is an island, and we can only deliver sustainability impact through close collaboration with our suppliers, customers, partners and the wider industry. Some of the best projects we were involved in were collaborations with customers, or through funding independent organisations. This is particularly critical when it comes to ensuring sustainable supply of raw ingredients, and our close, direct relationships with tea and coffee farmers around the world is central to our new strategy.\n\n**8. Making Things Right When You Get It Wrong**\n\nEarlier this year, we discovered that [abuse and harassment](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64662056) had been taking place in our Kenyan tea farm business. This was despite concerted efforts over the years to combat this issue. Management in both Kenya and the U.K. was rightly horrified by this, and quickly took action to prevent misconduct such as this ever happening again. The independent investigation we commissioned is still ongoing \u2013 and we are committed to ensuring the remediation plan is implemented in full \u2013 but it was a wake-up call that we can never be complacent when it comes to the safety and welfare of people connected with our business.\n\n**9. Using Sustainability as a Core Value to Engage and Inspire**\n\nIn 2018, we made \u201csustainable\u201d one of our core values. This has served us well over the last five years and helps inform decision making, both strategic and day to day. As we embark on the new stage of our sustainability journey, we need to grow our focus on this value, ensuring that it is always front of mind.\n\n**10. Putting Lessons into Practice**\n\nSustainability has never been more important and as we look to the future, we\u2019re rolling out our new sustainability strategy which is partly based on the lessons we have learnt. Threats like climate change and socio-economic challenges in producer regions are existential threats to our industry and any business setting a sustainability strategy now for the medium to long term must ensure that targets are both suitably ambitious, and laser focussed on delivering positive impact.\n\n*To learn more about Finlays, visit [Finlays.net](https://www.finlays.net/about-us/overview/).*\n\n*Joe Yalley-Ogunro is the group head of Sustainability at Finlays.

Yet \u201cmycorrhizal fungi have been largely overlooked,\u201d said [Toby Kiers](https://www.spun.earth/about/team), executive director of the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks.\n\n\u201cThey represent an incredibly important part of the carbon cycle [and] we are only just beginning to understand how they work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe urgency to understand that and link it to biodiversity below ground is paramount.\u201d\n\nSo paramount that Kiers and her colleagues spent about two years compiling and analyzing information from 194 distinct data sets from all around the world. The data were collected from environments that included handheld Petri dishes, greenhouses and massive forests. \n\n   ![Mycorrhizal fungi growing with a plant root.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/815277a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x1200+0+0/resize/1200x900!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F5a%2F6d71c9c14f618792f1994a87a332%2Fmycorrhizal-fungi-growing-with-a-plant-rootcredit-dr-yoshihiro-kobae.jpg)   Mycorrhizal fungi growing with a plant root. (Yoshihiro Kobae)  AdvertisementThe tricky part was harmonizing the data so that they could be examined together, said [Kiers](https://www.amsterdamecology.nl/principal-investigators/toby-kiers/), who is also a biologist at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. \n\nBy measuring the amount of carbon dioxide each type of plant takes in and the type of mycorrhizal fungi associated with it, the researchers were able to estimate how much carbon was sent underground and kept out of the atmosphere as a result of the symbiotic relationship. Then they added up the contributions from all plant-fungi pairs.\n\nThe number they came up with was 13.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide. To put that in perspective, the total amount of carbon emitted globally in 2021 was about 36.6 gigatons. \n\nThe researchers also said that plants associated with mycorrhizal fungi can take in eight times more carbon than plants that are not. \n\n[The results](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(23)00167-7.pdf) were published recently in the journal Current Biology.\n\n [![illustration of a man in the desert with a large hot sun behind him. a wavy heat effect animates.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/612fcc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1600+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F54%2F5dbd03cb417ab98bbc6e861590cf%2Fheat-large-sun-blur.gif)](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-27/she-will-never-forget-this-haunting-death-valley-encounter)    [California](https://www.latimes.com/california) \n\n ###  [I searched hell on Earth for a story. What I found will haunt me forever](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-27/she-will-never-forget-this-haunting-death-valley-encounter)\n\n A visit to Death Valley National Park has profound consequences for a veteran of extreme temperature. \u201cI thought I knew heat.\u201d\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\nThe study represents the first attempt to quantify the total amount of carbon being transferred to mycorrhizal fungi across the globe. The authors cautioned that their calculation is an estimate, adding that they suspect the fungi are probably receiving more carbon than they were able to account for.\n\n \u201cWe know that soil is an important carbon sink,\u201d said [Heidi-Jayne Hawkins](https://science.uct.ac.za/department-biological-sciences/contacts/heidi-jayne-hawkins), a plant eco-physiology researcher at the University of Cape Town in South Africa and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cBut mycorrhizal fungi have not been explicitly evaluated for their role in this carbon sink, which could help inform land use planning and conservation.\u201d\n\nThe study results can improve the accuracy of climate models and help scientists better predict what would happen if the fungi were lost in the future, she said.\n\n[Stephanie Kivlin](https://eeb.utk.edu/people/stephanie-kivlin/), an ecologist at University of Tennessee, said the study is a crucial step toward improving our understanding of the plant-fungi duo\u2019s role in reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThese mutualisms can act as a critical carbon sink in many terrestrial ecosystems,\u201d she said.\n\nNot only do the fungi take in carbon from plants, they also help keep that carbon safely below ground by creating a sticky compound that holds the soil together, preventing erosion.\n\nAlthough mycorrhizal fungi have short life spans \u2014 only a few years \u2014 their usefulness doesn\u2019t end after death. \n\n\u201cThis is my favorite part,\u201d Kiers said. \u201cAfter they die, they make \u2018necromass,\u2019 a dead underground network that acts as a scaffolding to hold the soil together,\u201d locking the carbon in place.\n\nBut fertilizers interfere with this relationship. If plants can get their nutrients from fertilizers, they become less dependent on the mycorrhizal fungi. That limits the growth of the underground fungal matrix, resulting in soil erosion and ultimately more carbon winding up back in the atmosphere.\n\nCompared with native plants, fertilized crops send only about one-fourth as much carbon underground, Kiers said. [The rapid conversion](https://ourworldindata.org/peak-agriculture-land) of wild areas to agricultural ones will reduce the amount of carbon stored in the soil, she said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only part of the problem. Kiers said there is so much fertilizer in the environment that it has made its way into rain clouds and waterways, which means it can reach [plants outside of croplands](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-agriculture) and harm fungi in the wild as well.\n\nQuantifying the amount of carbon held by mycorrhizal fungi in various ecosystems can help conservationists identify land areas that are most in need of restoration and protection, Hawkins said.\n\n \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand what land we have to urgently conserve and how to restore natural areas,\u201d Kiers said. \u201cWe want to make sure these fungi are an important component of that.\u201d  \n\n\n ", "summaries": [{"summary": "Around 36% of the carbon released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is captured and delivered to mycorrhizal fungi living underground.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "This discovery highlights the important role of mycorrhizal fungi in capturing carbon and reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."}, {"summary": "Plants associated with mycorrhizal fungi can take in eight times more carbon than plants without them.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The presence of mycorrhizal fungi significantly increases carbon intake in plants, which is beneficial for carbon sequestration."}, {"summary": "Fertilizers interfere with the symbiotic relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi, limiting carbon capture and causing soil erosion.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The use of fertilizers reduces the dependency of plants on mycorrhizal fungi, leading to a decline in carbon storage and negative environmental consequences."}, {"summary": "Quantifying the carbon held by mycorrhizal fungi can inform land use planning, conservation, and restoration efforts.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Understanding the amount of carbon stored by mycorrhizal fungi can guide actions to protect and restore ecosystems for better carbon management."}], "semantic_commentary": "Mycorrhizal fungi help capture carbon; inform land use planning.", "sentiment_score": 0.5, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the system of mycorrhizal fungi capturing carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon and its capture by mycorrhizal fungi."}]}, {"source": "ANI News", "link": "https://www.aninews.in/news/world/middle-east/uae-ead-supports-adnocs-commitment-to-achieving-carbon-neutrality-in-abu-dhabi20230801233038", "title": "UAE: EAD supports ADNOC\u2019s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality in Abu Dhabi", "content": "\n\n[![](https://d3lzcn6mbbadaf.cloudfront.net/static/img/red-dot.gif)\n \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0916\u092c\u0930](/hindi/khabar/)\n\n\n\n\n![Representative Image](https://d3lzcn6mbbadaf.cloudfront.net/media/details/ANI-20230801165239.jpg \"UAE: EAD supports ADNOC\u2019s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality in Abu Dhabi\")\n\n*Representative Image*\n\n\n\nUAE: EAD supports ADNOC\u2019s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality in Abu Dhabi\n================================================================================\n\n\n\n\nANI |\n Updated: Aug 01, 2023 23:30  IST\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nAbu Dhabi [[UAE](/topic/uae)], August 1 (ANI/WAM):\u00a0Dr Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary-General of the [Environment Agency in Abu Dhabi](/topic/environment-agency-in-abu-dhabi) ([EAD](/topic/ead)), praised the [Decarbonisation Plan](/topic/decarbonisation-plan) recently launched by [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc), [EAD](/topic/ead)'s key implementation partner in Abu Dhabi\u2019s Climate Change Strategy, lauding [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc)\u2019s innovative and forward-looking solutions to achieve the objectives of this ambitious strategy.  \nThe five-year Abu Dhabi Climate Change Strategy is a major contribution to Abu Dhabi\u2019s climate action ambitions at various levels and will help achieve the objectives of the [UAE](/topic/uae)'s strategic Net Zero by 2050 initiative, which was pledged by the [UAE](/topic/uae)\u2019s leadership, as a national drive aimed at reducing emissions.  \nThe strategy will drive innovation in carbon capture and storage efforts and identifies measures for diversifying the economy to include low-carbon sectors. In specific for the oil and gas sector the target set by the strategy is 25 percent reduction of [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc) carbon intensity by 2030 to achieve a level amongst the lowest emissions per barrel of oil in the industry globally.  \nCommenting on [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc)\u2019s [Decarbonisation Plan](/topic/decarbonisation-plan), Dr Shaikha said, \u201cThe oil and gas industry is one of the most economically important sectors as well as one of the key emitting sectors in the emirate.  \nTherefore, the decrease in the sector\u2019s emissions intensity to levels that are considered among the lowest in the world, and the announcement of a reduction in carbon emissions of nearly 5.4 million tonnes across [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc)\u2019s operations in 2022 is an important milestone in the emirate\u2019s strategic climate action pathway.\u201d  \n\n\n \nSponsored Content\n\n[[![](https://cdn.mgid.com/images/mgid/mgid_ua.svg)](https://widgets.mgid.com/?utm_source=www.aninews.in&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=widgets&utm_content=713570)\n\n\n[![](https://cdn.mgid.com/images/logos/Adchoices.svg)](https://www.mgid.com/services/privacy-policy)](#)\n\n\n[![](https://s-img.mgid.com/g/16647783/492x277/-/aHR0cDovL2NsLmltZ2hvc3RzLmNvbS9pbWdoL2ltYWdlL2ZldGNoL2FyXzE2OjksY19maWxsLGVfc2hhcnBlbjoxMDAsZl9qcGcsZ19mYWNlczphdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLHdfMTAyMC9odHRwOi8vaW1naG9zdHMuY29tL3QvMjAyMy0wNy8yNzc4NTYvN2M0ZWE4MjVkYjU4ZmU4MzFiZDA3YmY2YmFjODI1MWUuanBn.jpg?v=1691100540-6yjOQbErv5UemRbjNYzDKjpwrHsjYsUVb3o2f5XwdEc)](https://activeketo/Lose_Belly_Fat_Fast_One_Teaspoon_Burns_6_Kilos_A_Week)[Active Keto](https://activeketo/Lose_Belly_Fat_Fast_One_Teaspoon_Burns_6_Kilos_A_Week)[Lose Belly Fat Fast: One Teaspoon Burns 6 Kilos A Week!](https://activeketo/Lose_Belly_Fat_Fast_One_Teaspoon_Burns_6_Kilos_A_Week)[Active Keto](https://activeketo/Lose_Belly_Fat_Fast_One_Teaspoon_Burns_6_Kilos_A_Week)[Active Keto](https://activeketo/Lose_Belly_Fat_Fast_One_Teaspoon_Burns_6_Kilos_A_Week)[Craft Hub](https://crafthub/Premium_Wooden_Jigsaw_Puzzles_-_Closing_Sale_-_85_Off)[Premium Wooden Jigsaw Puzzles - Closing Sale - 85% Off](https://crafthub/Premium_Wooden_Jigsaw_Puzzles_-_Closing_Sale_-_85_Off)[Craft Hub](https://crafthub/Premium_Wooden_Jigsaw_Puzzles_-_Closing_Sale_-_85_Off)[Craft Hub](https://crafthub/Premium_Wooden_Jigsaw_Puzzles_-_Closing_Sale_-_85_Off)[![](https://s-img.mgid.com/g/16746911/492x277/-/aHR0cDovL2NsLmltZ2hvc3RzLmNvbS9pbWdoL2ltYWdlL2ZldGNoL2FyXzE2OjksY19maWxsLGVfc2hhcnBlbjoxMDAsZl9qcGcsZ19mYWNlczphdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLHdfMTAyMC9odHRwOi8vaW1naG9zdHMuY29tL3QvMjAyMy0wNy8zNDI4MjAvZDIwNjdlMTZlNTlmMzgxNTc2OGYwODJlODkyMjg0YWMuanBn.jpg?v=1691100540-WBlbp8H0fLdZEt2P9aAaMe4qDzYKFKsws9lkM-QB7vo)](https://ketoextremefatburner/The_Surprising_Reason_Why_Youre_Not_Losing_Weight)[Keto Extreme Fat Burner](https://ketoextremefatburner/The_Surprising_Reason_Why_Youre_Not_Losing_Weight)[The Surprising Reason Why You're Not Losing Weight](https://ketoextremefatburner/The_Surprising_Reason_Why_Youre_Not_Losing_Weight)[Keto Extreme Fat Burner](https://ketoextremefatburner/The_Surprising_Reason_Why_Youre_Not_Losing_Weight)[Keto Extreme Fat Burner](https://ketoextremefatburner/The_Surprising_Reason_Why_Youre_Not_Losing_Weight)[![](https://s-img.mgid.com/g/15803587/492x277/-/aHR0cDovL2NsLmltZ2hvc3RzLmNvbS9pbWdoL2ltYWdlL2ZldGNoL2FyXzE2OjksY19maWxsLGVfc2hhcnBlbjoxMDAsZl9qcGcsZ19mYWNlczphdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLHdfMTAyMC9odHRwOi8vaW1naG9zdHMuY29tL3QvMjAyMy0wNC8yNDQ4MTQvZDc4YjY4ZmRiNTExMzVmNTI2YjA2NTIwNmViY2ViZmUuanBn.jpg?v=1691100540-KuFG9-8rFtkcMDp4rZgoE_9txaRi-I8A8mf2aWwTpgM)](https://searchads/Unsold_Container_Houses_Sale_For_Almost_Nothing)[Search Ads](https://searchads/Unsold_Container_Houses_Sale_For_Almost_Nothing)[Unsold Container Houses Sale For Almost Nothing](https://searchads/Unsold_Container_Houses_Sale_For_Almost_Nothing)[Search Ads](https://searchads/Unsold_Container_Houses_Sale_For_Almost_Nothing)[Search Ads](https://searchads/Unsold_Container_Houses_Sale_For_Almost_Nothing) She elaborated, \u201c[EAD](/topic/ead) and [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc)\u2019s cooperation journey to transform the energy sector began more than 15 years ago.

North America's leading developer and supplier of forest carbon offsets, today announced the launch of a new initiative that will allow landowners with 40-5,000 acres of forestland to generate long-term revenue by efficiently enrolling in a carbon offset program. The collaboration will allow landowners in 13 southeastern states to enroll land beginning today.\n\n\n\n\n\n> \u201cOur program provides landowners the flexibility to continue to utilize their land while creating a transparent and attractive revenue stream.\u201d\n> \n> [Tweet this](#)\n\n\n\nLandYield provides payments to U.S. non-industrial forest landowners to defer commercial timber harvests and increase the carbon stored on their lands. Enrolled landowners commit to significant management changes, which in turn deliver long-term climate benefits. Landowners in LandYield\u2019s program make a 40-year commitment \u2013 growing stands for 20 years and then maintaining that stocking for an additional 20 years. These offset projects are developed and verified under the American Carbon Registry\u2019s (ACR) peer-reviewed methodology, Improved Forest Management on Small Non-Industrial Private Forestlands (SNIPFL), designed specifically for family forests.\n\n\n\n\nCreating family landowner access to carbon markets, previously only accessible to larger, institutional landowners, allows the potential for carbon revenues to be spent locally, helping support rural economies. Participating landowners also help maintain recreational values, protect water resources, and improve habitat quality on enrolled lands.\n\n\n\n\nLandYield leverages Finite Carbon\u2019s CORE Carbon\u00ae platform (the \u201cplatform\u201d) to reduce measurement and verification costs and deliver more value to landowners. The platform allows LandYield to provide eligible landowners immediate estimates of the amount of revenue they can potentially earn. Through streamlined online enrollment, project development and ongoing monitoring infrastructure, CORE Carbon ensures the resulting offsets are verified and represent a quantifiable capture of carbon.\n\n\n\n\nFinite Carbon developed CORE Carbon using innovative remote sensing technology enabled by satellite imagery alongside data from the U.S. Forest Service to measure and monitor forest growth. This information is used to calculate the specific carbon dioxide emission reductions and removals which can result from improved forest management practices on a given piece of land.\n\n\n\n\nLandYield benefits from administrative support of Mercuria Energy, one of the world\u2019s largest independent energy and commodity groups, for expertise in sales, operations and risk management, to leverage the CORE Carbon platform, to achieve meaningful scale, and offer landowners access to long term arrangements providing a reliable, quarterly payment schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe innovative and complimentary skill sets of LandYield and Finite Carbon are ideally suited to provide assurance to landowners that they\u2019re enrolling their land in a carbon program designed to provide financial and environmental benefits for the long-term,\u201d said Josh Fain, LandYield Director. \u201cOur program provides landowners the flexibility to continue to utilize their land while creating a transparent and attractive revenue stream.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n**Program details**\n\n\n\nLandowners have the flexibility to enroll only a portion of their forestlands in the program as well as the ability to pursue other commercial activities such as leasing hunting rights and collecting non-timber forest products.\n\n\n\n\nLandowners are compensated quarterly as they meet the reporting and monitoring obligations set forth by the program. This process is managed through the CORE Carbon platform which simplifies monitoring and communication through an intuitive, user-friendly dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor more than a decade, Finite Carbon has played a leading role advancing carbon markets in the United States, developing best practices, driving innovation and technological advancement to benefit landowners and buyers of natural climate solutions,\u201d said Sean Carney, CEO of Finite Carbon. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to team up with LandYield to create long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with a broad range of landowners by providing a financial incentive for their environmental stewardship so people can enjoy their land for generations to come.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe program is initially open to eligible landowners in the southeastern U.S. The region, which includes between 105-120 million acres of family-owned forest land, covers Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.

The CORE Carbon platform contains an easy-to-use digital mapping tool that provides landowners with an immediate carbon revenue proposal for their land at no cost and allows for the on-going management of their project.\n\n\n\n\n1 [https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12001](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcrsreports.congress.gov%2Fproduct%2Fpdf%2FIF%2FIF12001&esheet=53491267&newsitemid=20230801272210&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fcrsreports.congress.gov%2Fproduct%2Fpdf%2FIF%2FIF12001&index=6&md5=1bd91d17a9a784ae8f82e9cad0903e8b)\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "LandYield and Finite Carbon have launched an initiative that allows landowners in 13 southeastern states to enroll land in a carbon offset program, generating long-term revenue.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The initiative provides landowners with a flexible and attractive revenue stream."}, {"summary": "LandYield provides payments to non-industrial forest landowners to defer timber harvests and increase carbon storage on their lands.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Enrolled landowners commit to management changes that deliver long-term climate benefits."}, {"summary": "The collaboration between LandYield and Finite Carbon allows family landowners to access carbon markets, supporting rural economies.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The initiative enables carbon revenues to be spent locally and maintains recreational values, water resources, and habitat quality."}], "semantic_commentary": "This article relates to the intent as it discusses a carbon offset program that allows landowners to generate revenue by increasing carbon storage on their lands.", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions a program that allows landowners to enroll land in a carbon offset program, indicating a system or policy that removes carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions LandYield providing payments to landowners to increase carbon storage on their lands, indicating a commitment to reducing carbon footprint."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, specifically the collaboration between LandYield and Finite Carbon to access carbon markets."}, {"category": "category_o1", "reason": "The article is related to carbon and does not fall under any other specific category."}]}, {"source": "Yahoo News UK", "link": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/wildlife-park-meadows-bring-big-080252249.html", "title": "Yahoo is part of the Yahoo family of brands", "content": "\n If you click '**Accept all**', we and [our partners](/v2/partners-list?sessionId=4_cc-session_04cccc30-79dc-4f5c-b8ed-63d17cfa05f4) will also use cookies and your personal data (such as IP address, precise location, and browsing and search data) to:\n\n* display personalised ads and content based on interest profiles\n* measure the effectiveness of personalised ads and content, and\n* develop and improve our products and services\n\n\n If you do not want us and our partners to use cookies and personal data for these additional purposes, click '**Reject all**'.\n\n\n\n If you would like to customise your choices, click '**Manage privacy settings**'.\n\n\n\n You can change your choices at any time by clicking on the 'Privacy & cookie settings' or 'Privacy dashboard' links on our sites and apps.

It has invested close to \u20ac200 million in the industry and has \u20ac450 million-worth of assets under management. Its investment portfolio includes two companies in the alternative ingredients space - single-cell protein producer Calysta and Protix, which produces insect meal. Its latest impact report concludes by urging more investment in startups such as these to ensure they can scale up and save increasingly precious marine resources.\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that the true impact of fishing forage fish has yet to be taken into account when calculating the carbon footprint of fish meal. A more accurate calculation and the possible generation of carbon credits would help to more fairly reflect real costs of fishmeal vis-a-vis alternative feed ingredients,\u201d the report explains.\n\n\nAs a result, they have pledged to explore research connecting biodiversity to carbon credits \u2013 which might be good news for alternative aquafeed ingredient producers, and raise further sustainability questions about the fishmeal and fish oil industries.\n\n\n\u201cFishmeal and fish oil are -and will remain - finite resources, and we must find alternatives to sustain their growth. To make things worse, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts that climate change will make El Ni\u00f1o events - which negatively influence Peruvian anchoveta, one of the main sources of wild fish used for fishmeal - stronger and stronger. All in all, the future isn\u2019t bright for fishmeal and fish oil,\u201d the report explains.\n\n\nThey are therefore looking to bring institutional investors into the alternative ingredient sector, including companies within their own investment portfolio.\n\n\n\"We believe that Calysta and Protix are viable and more sustainable protein alternatives to fishmeal and soy. We now need to bring these solutions to scale so that the ingredients become more accessible and affordable,\" they argue.\n\n\n\u201cThe next big task will be driving more institutional capital into this space, to scale the solutions and further the work. We hope that by 2025 alternative feed ingredients will be a subsector that proves the need for capital to reach its goals of driving major change. We know wild-caught feed ingredients have a major negative impact on biodiversity and the health of a functioning ocean ecosystem. [Aqua-Spark](https://aqua-spark.nl/) has multiple alternatives that are showing great results but need tremendous scale to provide industrywide access. The production and results have been proven - now it\u2019s time for capital to help us get there,\u201d the report concludes. \n\n\n*\\*The Fish Site is part of Aqua-Spark's investment portfolio, but The Fish Site retains editorial independence.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent features\n---------------\n\n\n\n\n\n###  [A game-changer for oyster growers and gourmands](https://thefishsite.com/articles/a-game-changer-for-oyster-growers-and-gourmands-aqua-mould-systems-qyster)\n\n\n\n\n[Technology & equipment](https://thefishsite.com/category/technology-equipment) \n\n2 August 2023\n\n\n\n![](https://images.thefishsite.com/fish/articles/shellfish/Qyster-growing-system-2-Opito-Bay.jpg?width=306&height=191&scale.option=fill&cw=306&ch=191)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###  [Rabobank / Gorjan Nikolik reports](https://thefishsite.com/series/rabobank-gorjan-nikolik-reports)\n[Could El Ni\u00f1o and the price crisis create a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d for Asian shrimp farmers?](https://thefishsite.com/articles/could-el-ni\u00f1o-and-the-price-crisis-create-a-nightmare-scenario-for-asian-shrimp-farmers-gorjan-nikolik-rabobank)\n\n\n\n\n[Fish stocks](https://thefishsite.com/category/fisheries/fish-stocks) \n\n31 July 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###  [Is your water disinfectant compatible with your RAS biofilter?](https://thefishsite.com/articles/is-your-water-disinfectant-compatible-with-your-ras-biofilter-halamid)\n\n\n\n\n[Water quality](https://thefishsite.com/category/environment/water-quality) \n\n28 July 2023\nSponsored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest stories\n--------------\n\n\n\n\n\n###  [Thai Union publishes 2022 Sustainability Report](https://thefishsite.com/articles/thai-union-publishes-2022-sustainability-report)\n\n\n\n\n[Sustainability](https://thefishsite.com/category/environment/sustainability) \n\n3 August 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###  [Northern Irish feed firm looks to step up expansion into aquaculture](https://thefishsite.com/articles/northern-irish-feed-firm-looks-to-step-up-expansion-into-aquaculture)\n\n\n\n\n[Formulated feed](https://thefishsite.com/category/nutrition/formulated-feed) \n\n3 August 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###  [Hemp seeds show promise in aquafeeds](https://thefishsite.com/articles/hemp-seeds-show-promise-in-aquafeeds)\n\n\n\n\n[Feed ingredients](https://thefishsite.com/category/nutrition/feed-ingredients) \n\n3 August 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###  [Hanover to host RAS and aquaponics event](https://thefishsite.com/articles/hanover-to-host-ras-and-aquaponics-event)\n\n\n\n\n[Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS)](https://thefishsite.com/category/production-systems/recirculating-aquaculture-systems-ras) \n\n2 August 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article \n\n\n\n\n\nFiled as:\n[Fisheries](https://thefishsite.com/category/fisheries)\n[Fish stocks](https://thefishsite.com/category/fisheries/fish-stocks)\n[Nutrition](https://thefishsite.com/category/nutrition)\n[Feed ingredients](https://thefishsite.com/category/nutrition/feed-ingredients)\n[Investment](https://thefishsite.com/category/investment)\n[Biodiversity](https://thefishsite.com/category/biodiversity)\n[Europe](https://thefishsite.com/region/europe)\n[Netherlands](https://thefishsite.com/country/nl)\n\n\n\n\n[Rob Fletcher](https://thefishsite.com/contributors/rob-fletcher)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRob Fletcher has been writing about aquaculture since 2007, as editor of *Fish Farmer*, *Fish Farming Expert* and *The Fish Site*.

Platforms are allowing cross-border trades and products are diversifying, including derivatives.\n\n\n**Trading platforms allow cross-border transactions**\n\n\nThere are two international emission trading platforms: one in Hainan, the other Hong Kong. Both allow cross-border trades.\n\n\n* The Hainan International Carbon Emissions Trading Center launched in July 2022. Six months later the first cross-border carbon trade took place, involving the trading of Verified Carbon Units (**VCUs**) under the globally recognized Verified Carbon Standard (**VCS**). The trade originated from India, with a total volume of 10,185 tons.\n* The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (**HKEx**) introduced a new international carbon market called Core Climate on 28 October 2022. Participants on the platform can access product information and engage in voluntary carbon credit trading.\n* The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (**MEE**) is promoting the construction of a centralised voluntary emission reduction trading market and plans to reopen the CCER market. The CCER is widely anticipated to resume soon.\n\n\n**Financial complexity is evolving beyond spot trades \u2013 and infrastructure is adjusting**\n\n\n* **Financial derivatives have emerged** in regional pilots, include funds, bonds, pledge financing and repo financing, adding depth and diversity to the market. These innovations have developed in several pilot regions including Beijing, Hubei, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou.\n* **The Guangzhou Futures Exchange** plans to introduce green and low-carbon futures trading products, such as CEAs.\n* **Financial institutions are increasingly engaging** **in the carbon market**. Eight securities companies are authorised to trade carbon emissions using their own funds, having received non-objection letters from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.\n* **Carbon trading infrastructure is evolving.** The Shanghai Clearing House treats carbon emissions as commodities and provides central counterparty clearing for CNY Emission Allowance Forward (**CEAF**). Additionally, Hubei has proposed creating a clearing infrastructure for spot and derivatives in the carbon market.\n* **We expect Hong Kong and Mainland's carbon derivatives market will soon interconnect.** The Inter-agency Supervisory Group released a feasibility assessment exploring investor access to China's carbon market via the Greater Bay Area platform, promoting carbon market interconnection. It proposes including carbon derivatives provisions in legislation.\n\n\n**China\u2019s efforts to improve carbon data transparency**\n\n\nSince 2020, China has introduced voluntary and mandatory measures to enhance transparency, responsibility and incentivise emission reduction for sustainable development.\n\n\n**Policies encourage voluntary environmental information disclosure**\n\n\nVoluntary environmental disclosure helps companies to establish a positive social reputation and facilitates financing (given China\u2019s urging of banks to consider environmental reports to encourage sustainable practices).\n\n\n![](https://d2dzik4ii1e1u6.cloudfront.net/images/lexology/static/9948c4da-41d7-4b87-9508-9018d368bec2.jpg)\n\n\n* **Listed companies** are encouraged to disclose environmental information including regarding verification, appraisal and evaluation by third-party organisations. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange (**SZSE**) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (**SSE**) also promote disclosure of pollutant data in social responsibility reports or individual reports.\n* **Listed companies controlled by state-owned enterprise** **(SOE)** are encouraged to disclose ESG reports by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (**SASAC**), aiming for \"full coverage\" by 2023.\n\n\n**Mandatory disclosure requirements have grown \u2013 and the trend will continue**\n\n\nCompanies must disclose environmental information under regulations implemented in 2015. The scope expanded in 2022 to cover more entities, introduce a centralized reporting system, require detailed carbon emissions information and increase the maximum fine to 100,000 yuan. Currently, enforcement primarily relies on administrative penalties and civil liabilities, but a comprehensive system is planned.\n\n\n* **Timely, truthful, accurate and complete** disclosure is required.\n* **A comprehensive mandatory disclosure system** is planned by 2025, under the \"Reform Plan for the Mandatory Disclosure of Environmental Information\" released in 2021.\n* **Administrative penalties** apply to enterprises that fail to disclose environmental information truthfully and accurately. This includes orders of correction from government authorities, public notices of criticism and fines.\n* **Civil liability (based on judicial opinions) may** apply to:\n\t+ listed companies and debt-issuing enterprises that fail to disclose investment details, including climate change and environmental issues of financed projects, per updated \"Administrative Measures\".\n\t+ key pollution-discharging companies, their subsidiaries, and listed companies in specific industries like thermal power generation that fail to disclose environmental information under the \"Securities Law\" and securities exchange regulations.\n\n\n**Providing guidance for enterprises to disclose environmental information**\n\n\nChina is also guiding enterprises to standardise the disclosure of environmental information.\n\n\n* An **adaptable framework** for disclosing environmental information - \"Corporate ESG Disclosure Guidelines\" (T/CERDS 2-2022) \u2013 was developed by the China Enterprise Reform and Development Research Society. It introduces the concept of Scopes One, Two, and Three in the GHG Protocol, covering emissions from operational activities, energy consumption and the entire value chain.\n* **Disclosure requirements for financial institutions** are specified in The People's Bank of China's \"Guidelines on Environmental Information Disclosure for Financial Institutions\", including qualitative and quantitative information. Each financial sub-sector, including commercial banks, has guidelines on the measurement and basis of quantitative information based on operational characteristics. These standards normalise behavior and promote transparency and credibility.\n\n\n**Private enterprises have taken strides too \u2013 disclosing corporate emissions and product carbon footprint**\n\n\nMany Chinese enterprises have disclosed carbon emissions data in \"carbon neutral\" or related reports. Some companies publish carbon neutral verification reports for products.\n\n\nMost reports are produced by recognized third-party certification bodies following international accounting standards, ensuring a certain level of international recognition.\n\n\n**How individuals are taking part in disclosing and cutting emissions**\n\n\nCorporate-led personal carbon accounts are enhancing transparency and widening environmental information disclosure. These systems lower participation barriers and costs to enable individuals to get involved and promote sustainable practices.\n\n\n* **People are incentivised to cut personal carbon emissions** through low-carbon behavior via platforms like Ant Group's \"Ant Forest\".\n* Users earn rewards, such as green energy, trees or protected land, based on their carbon reduction achievements.\n\n\n**The next frontier: further opening to foreigners, expanding carbon trading and boosting certification**\n\n\nAs China's carbon market system becomes more sophisticated and with the impending return of CCER, we anticipate that China's carbon market will further open to investors worldwide.\n\n\nThe unification and expansion of China\u2019s national ETS, along with the gradual liberalisation of voluntary carbon market products like CCERs, will significantly enlarge China\u2019s carbon market. This will enhance the effectiveness of the carbon pricing mechanism and encourage more businesses to participate. So too will increased connections, such as between Hong Kong and Mainland derivatives.\n\n\nFinancial and derivative innovation will lead to a wider range of financial and derivative products in China\u2019s carbon trading arena. The implementation of the Futures and Derivatives Act will support this, working to align with international rules and enhance the enforceability and irrevocability of netting termination.\n\n\nThe increased standardisation, certification and accreditation systems will help to promote the international recognition of China\u2019s carbon assets. China will expedite the approval of national standards for carbon emissions accounting and verification, along with making domestic standards more coherent with mainstream international standards in key areas. China will also encourage domestic certification bodies to participate in international carbon emission certification programs and international carbon emission certification systems with mutual recognition. This is to address the insufficient number of accredited certification bodies compared to the large number of Chinese enterprises.\n\n\nChina's efforts to accelerate voluntary cuts to emissions and carbon data transparency for corporations are critical steps towards achieving a sustainable future. By promoting environmental information disclosure, China is fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and environmental responsibility among enterprises.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "China's efforts to encourage businesses to cut emissions and improve carbon data transparency are critical to achieving a sustainable future.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "China's efforts are focused on achieving a sustainable future."}, {"summary": "China's laws and regulations are improving the carbon settings and setting emission reduction targets.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "China is committed to hitting peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060."}, {"summary": "China's carbon markets are expanding and becoming more complex, with increased participation and the introduction of financial derivatives.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The expansion and complexity of the carbon markets demonstrate progress and interest in carbon trading."}, {"summary": "China is improving carbon data transparency through voluntary and mandatory measures, including encouraging environmental information disclosure.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Improving transparency fosters a culture of accountability and environmental responsibility among enterprises."}, {"summary": "China is guiding enterprises to standardize the disclosure of environmental information and has developed guidelines for financial institutions.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Standardization promotes transparency and credibility in disclosing environmental information."}, {"summary": "Individuals are participating in disclosing and cutting emissions through personal carbon accounts and low-carbon behavior platforms.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Individual participation enhances transparency and promotes sustainable practices."}, {"summary": "China's carbon market is expected to further open to investors worldwide, expanding trading and boosting certification.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The opening of the carbon market will enhance the effectiveness of the carbon pricing mechanism and encourage more businesses to participate."}], "semantic_commentary": "China's carbon efforts crucial for selling credits to organizations.", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions China's efforts to improve carbon data transparency and reduce emissions."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions China's carbon markets expanding and individuals participating in cutting emissions."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about China's carbon markets and carbon data transparency."}, {"category": "category_o1", "reason": "The article is related to carbon and does not fall into any other category."}]}, {"source": "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists", "link": "https://thebulletin.org/2023/08/regulatory-agency-asks-public-to-report-fraud-in-voluntary-carbon-markets/", "title": "Public asked to report fraud in voluntary carbon markets - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists", "content": "*Editor\u2019s note: This story was originally published by* [Grist](https://grist.org/regulation/this-little-known-federal-regulator-could-crack-down-on-fraudulent-carbon-offsets/). *It appears here as part of the\u00a0[Climate Desk](https://www.climatedesk.org/)\u00a0collaboration.*\n\n\nAcross the United States, more and more companies are pledging to zero out their greenhouse gas emissions using \u201cvoluntary carbon offsets\u201d \u2014 credits that represent some amount of climate pollution that\u2019s either prevented or removed from the atmosphere.\n\n\nThese credits, bought and sold on unregulated markets that are expected to be worth up to [$100 billion by 2030](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/carbon-offset-market-growth), have long drawn criticism for failing to deliver on their promised emission reductions. Some credits come from projects that claim to protect forests that were never in danger of being cut down. Others pull carbon out of the air, but only temporarily, or are susceptible to \u201cdouble-counting,\u201d in which the same credits are claimed by two separate organizations. Experts have described offsets as a \u201c[climate scam](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/17/carbon-offsets-flights-airlines/)\u201d and the voluntary market for them a \u201c[Wild West](https://www.ft.com/content/9b02fcf7-9e04-4b71-ad14-251552d5a78e).\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, federal regulatory agencies are beginning to take note. One of these is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, an independent government body charged with ensuring the stability of the country\u2019s derivatives markets. This week, the commission held its [second roundtable discussion](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8731-23) on promoting \u201cintegrity for high quality carbon credit derivatives,\u201d and other recent actions suggest that it\u2019s gearing up for a more proactive regulatory role in this space.\n\n\nLast month, for example, the CFTC released a [whistleblower alert](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8723-23) asking the public for tips about fraud and manipulation in voluntary carbon markets \u2014 a \u201cprecursor\u201d to bringing enforcement actions against market manipulators, according to Todd Phillips, a fellow at the think tank the Roosevelt Institute. Just a few days later, the CFTC announced a new [Environmental Fraud Task Force](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8736-23) within its enforcement division, to help investigate cases of \u201cfraud and misconduct\u201d in offset-related markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is uniquely situated to address this issue,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere really is no one else.\u201d\n\n\nExactly how they\u2019ll do it, however, is uncertain.\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, created by Congress in 1974, regulates the U.S. markets for derivatives, contracts between parties in which prices are derived from the value of an underlying asset or benchmark. Such contracts can help hedge against risk; a futures contract, for example, guarantees the price for which a given asset will be sold at some point in the future. Farmers often use these kinds of contracts to guarantee their crops will sell for an agreed-upon price at the end of the harvest, protecting them from a downward swing in the market. Meanwhile, the CFTC\u2019s job is to ensure that the crops actually get delivered, as per the contract.\n\n\nThis is all relatively straightforward when it comes to derivatives involving tangible commodities like wheat, which the CFTC has long regulated. But it\u2019s more complicated when it comes to carbon offsets. Offset credits are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters, sold to brokers, and then [purchased by a company or organization](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/voluntary-carbon-markets-ecosystem-explained) to count toward their decarbonization pledges \u2014 often via a futures contract, if the emissions offset has yet to happen and is promised to occur at some point in the future. Compared to wheat, it\u2019s much less obvious what counts as the legitimate delivery of a carbon credit. Many market participants are concerned that if the underlying commodity \u2014 the offset \u2014 is based on fraudulent assumptions and does not actually cancel out climate pollution, then derivatives based on those commodities are also fraudulent.\n\n\n[RELATED:Don't call toxic wildfire smoke on the East Coast the 'new normal'](https://thebulletin.org/2023/07/dont-call-this-the-new-normal/)This is already a huge problem; experts have noted \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits. Buyers are motivated by low prices, for instance, and unregulated standard-setters run carbon credit registries that charge fees based on the volume of credits bought and sold, incentivizing them to set looser standards to enable more sales. Already, millions of rainforest-related credits approved by Verra, the world\u2019s largest standard-setter for the voluntary carbon markets, have been shown to be \u201c[nonadditional](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe),\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t yield additional emission reductions on top of what would have been expected if the credits didn\u2019t exist.\n\n\nRobin Rix, Verra\u2019s chief legal, policy, and markets officer, acknowledged at the CFTC roundtable on Wednesday that voluntary carbon markets have characteristics that make them \u201cvulnerable to abuse by malicious actors.\u201d But he said it\u2019s a \u201cmisconception\u201d that voluntary carbon markets lack transparency and said his organization would support \u201ca more muscular approach to fraud and market manipulation\u201d from the CFTC.\n\n\nVerra controls two-thirds of the world\u2019s voluntary carbon markets. The rest are largely dominated by just three other private registries: the Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, and the American Carbon Registry.\n\n\nThe CFTC has so far not waded into this morass, although many experts, advocacy groups, and even private businesses would like it to. Following the commission\u2019s first public convening on voluntary carbon markets last year, dozens of organizations responded to a [request for information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/08/2022-12302/request-for-information-on-climate-related-financial-risk) by saying that the CFTC should develop standards for carbon offsets that \u201c[effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can serve as underlying commodities for approved derivatives](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CFTC-Carbon-Offsets-Sign-On-Letter-final.pdf).\u201d\n\n\nFreya Chay, program lead for the climate data nonprofit CarbonPlan, said such standards should require voluntary carbon markets to clearly distinguish between offsets that *prevent* carbon emissions \u2014 like if a project developer builds a wind farm rather than a coal plant \u2014 and those that *remove* carbon from the atmosphere. She also called for greater transparency around the \u201cpermanence\u201d of removal-based offsets, i.e., how long they will keep carbon locked up. CO2 lasts around 1,000 years in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon credits derived from offset projects like tree-planting \u2014 which might only keep carbon sequestered for a dozen years, since forests are susceptible to wildfires and illegal logging \u2014 are often treated the same as those derived from geological sequestration, in which carbon is injected into rock formations and is more likely to stay put.\n\n\n[RELATED:How plants react to climate change could make floods a whole lot worse](https://thebulletin.org/2023/04/how-plants-respond-to-high-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide-levels-could-increase-flood-risks/)It\u2019s not clear, however, whether a definition of what constitutes a high-quality carbon offset will come from the CFTC. Many speakers at Wednesday\u2019s roundtable said that, in order to allow the voluntary carbon markets to \u201creach their full potential,\u201d the commission should leave definitional work to the private sector, perhaps in the hands of an independent body called the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets. One speaker, representing an advocacy group for forest owners, called for the CFTC to only regulate with \u201ca light touch\u201d that allows standard-setters like Verra to continue to \u201cinnovate.\u201d\n\n\nPhillips, with the Roosevelt Institute, said the CFTC should simply hold standard-setters responsible for the claims they make. During the roundtable, he emphasized three words: \u201cenforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201d\n\n\nGroups like Verra or the American Carbon Registry \u201chave standards that say if you meet these standards, your offsets will count as one ton of carbon emissions reduced,\u201d Phillips said in an interview with Grist. \u201cIf they make these assertions while knowing that they\u2019re not true, that\u2019s fraud.\u201d In such a case, the CFTC could impose [civil monetary penalties](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/Enforcement/OfficeofDirectorEnforcement.html), freeze assets, or restrict an organization\u2019s trading privileges. The commission could also refer the case to the Justice Department for prosecution.\n\n\nAs carbon markets grow, it\u2019s likely that the CFTC\u2019s efforts will complement or even overlap with work from other federal agencies to prevent offsets-related greenwashing. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example \u2014 an independent regulatory agency in charge of protecting investors \u2014 has proposed rules that would require companies to disclose \u201c[certain information](https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf)\u201d about offsets they use, although it\u2019s not yet clear what kind of information this would include. Some experts say another agency, the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 tasked with enforcing the United States\u2019 consumer protection laws \u2014 could step in by including a more concrete (albeit nonbinding) definition of a high-quality carbon offset in its soon-to-be-updated guidelines for environmental marketing claims.\n\n\nPhillips, however, is pinning his hopes on the CFTC, which he said has shown the most interest in bringing enforcement actions. Indeed, commissioners on Wednesday spoke forcefully about the need to clean up the voluntary carbon markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe rapid growth of these markets requires the commission\u2019s careful attention,\u201d Commissioner Kristin Johnson told attendees. \u201cOur common goal must be to adopt a transparent path that effectively prevents double-counting, ensures additionality, and prevents fraud.\u201d\n\n\nThe CFTC has issued [another request for information](https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7413) from the public and is accepting submissions until August 18.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ClimateDesk_logo-1.jpg)\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the US is taking steps to regulate the voluntary carbon offset market, which is expected to be worth up to $100 billion by 2030.

Much depends on the direction of the economy as well as the cost of zero-carbon generation technology. A robust, growing economy releases significantly more emissions than a slower growth one.

Quite a bit, as it turns out. Carbon markets in California and the North East (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative) are structured in a way that it becomes increasingly cost-prohibitive to emit greenhouse gases. As more supportive policy rolls out in the U.S., the regulated markets stand to benefit.\n\n\nIn an environment where greater reductions are needed, the costs of carbon allowances are likely to rise in the coming years. In California, the market already has a mechanism in place to raise the carbon allowance floor price every year.

They added in the publication, however, that, \u201cin recognition of the flaws in its market design, the EU moved to materially strengthen the system\u201d.\n\n\nThis included setting up a market stability reserve, increasing the emissions reduction target, accelerating the rate of reduction in the annual emissions cap, and lowering free allocations, the analysts highlighted in the report.\n\n\n\u201cAs a result, prices rose from an average of EUR 15.9/tCO2e in 2017, to EUR 80.9/tCO2e in 2022 and are set for further gains over the coming years,\u201d the BMI analysts stated in the report.\n\n\n\u201cThe bloc continues to tighten its environmental policies and the rising costs attached to deeper decarbonization will drive long-run price increases, with EUAs set to average comfortably above EUR 100/tCO2e by the mid-2020s, up from around EUR 87/tCO2e currently,\u201d they added.\n\n\nThe analysts noted in the report that the EU\u2019s experience can offer \u201cimportant lessons in market design and implementation to other countries, ideally allowing them to sidestep some of the pitfalls common to early carbon market evolution\u201d.\n\n\nOn its website, the European Commission (EC) describes the EU ETS as a cornerstone of the EU\u2019s policy to combat climate change and its key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively.\n\n\n\u201cIt is the world\u2019s first major carbon market and remains the biggest one,\u201d the EC\u2019s site states.\n\n\nThe EU ETS works on the \u2018cap and trade\u2019 principle, the EC site highlights, noting that a cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by the operators covered by the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall, the site notes.\n\n\n\u201cWithin the cap, operators\u00a0buy or receive\u00a0emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed,\u201d the EC site states.\n\n\n\u201cThe limit on the total number of allowances available ensures that they have a value. The price signal incentivizes emission reductions and promotes investment in innovative, low-carbon technologies, whilst trading brings flexibility that ensures emissions are cut where it costs least to do so,\u201d the site adds.\n\n\n\u201cAfter each year, an operator must surrender enough allowances to cover fully its emissions, otherwise heavy fines are imposed. If an installation reduces its emissions, it can keep the spare allowances to cover its future needs or else sell them to another operator that is short of allowances,\u201d the site continues.\n\n\n**USA, Canada**\n\n\nIn its report, BMI also looked at carbon pricing schemes from other sections of the globe, including the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\n\u201cWhile the U.S. has a growing number of ETSs in place at the state level, the lack of a federal carbon pricing scheme speaks to the highly politicized nature of the climate change and its increasing politicization globally,\u201d BMI analysts noted in the report.\n\n\n\u201cOver the years, various carbon pricing schemes have been proposed at the federal level, but they have been scuppered by the lack of bipartisan support for climate-related policies,\u201d they added.\n\n\n\u201cThere is wider support for a carbon border adjustment mechanism, although this could be difficult to implement in the absence of a federal CPI,\u201d they continued.\n\n\nThe analysts highlighted in the report that five ETSs are currently in place in the country. These comprise the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), Massachusetts Limits on Emissions from Electricity Generators, California\u2019s Cap-And-Trade, Washington\u2019s Cap-And-Invest, and the Oregon ETS, the report pointed out, adding that \u201cseveral more\u201d are under consideration or development.\n\n\n\u201cIn contrast to the U.S., Canada enjoys a strong and forwardly transparent federal carbon tax, which underlines the critical importance of robust financial incentives in driving deeper decarbonization,\u201d the BMI analysts said in the report.\n\n\n\u201cBy global standards, the current pricing level is relatively high, set at CAD 65/tCO2e (USD48/tCO2e) in 2023 and, while provinces are allowed to set their own CPIs, the country\u2019s federal backstop ensures minimum stringency standards across every market,\u201d they added.\n\n\n\u201cEqually important, the government has set out a clear price trajectory up to 2030, at levels broadly consistent with the Paris Agreement goals. As per the \u2018Update to the Pan-Canadian Approach To Carbon Pollution Pricing 2023-2030\u2019, carbon prices will rise by CAD 15/tCO2e every year to reach CAD 170/tCO2e by 2030,\u201d the BMI analysts continued.\n\n\n*To contact the author, email*[*andreas.exarheas@rigzone.com*](mailto:andreas.exarheas@rigzone.com)\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The European Union has the most developed emissions trading system (ETS) globally, with prices rising and set to increase further.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article highlights that the EU's emissions trading system has improved, with prices rising significantly and expected to continue increasing."}, {"summary": "The EU's experience can offer important lessons in market design and implementation to other countries.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article suggests that the EU's experience in implementing the emissions trading system can provide valuable insights for other countries, indicating a positive outcome."}, {"summary": "The U.S. lacks a federal carbon pricing scheme due to political factors, while Canada has a strong federal carbon tax.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The U.S. is noted to have a lack of federal support for carbon pricing schemes, indicating a negative situation.

Each of these registries provides competitive applicability conditions that must be met before the crediting period and complied with throughout the crediting period.\u00a0\n\n\n**What Do Voluntary Carbon Markets Do?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n[Net zero](https://earth.org/achieving-net-zero/) can be achieved through a variety of project activities including change in agricultural management practices (i.e., promoting no-till practices to avoid GHG emissions) or converting barren land into a created forest (i.e., planting trees in an area of no recent tree cover \u2013\u00a0a practice known as afforestation\u00a0\u2013 to sequester carbon from the atmosphere).\u00a0\n\n\nVCMs registries encourage project activities to include co-benefits and SDGs by providing additional credits when included. Co-benefits include additional environmental, economic, or social benefits while SDGs are specific types of co-benefits. For example, an entity looking to reforest/afforest land has the possibility to generate environmental co-benefits through providing new habitats for animal and insect species (SDG15: Life on Land). Additionally, an entity could introduce a social co-benefit by hiring a higher proportion of women to plant trees (SDG5: Gender Equality).\n\n\n**Are Voluntary Carbon Markets Beneficial?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nVCMs help major polluters offset GHG emissions and create innovative ways to solve the climate crisis. An [article](https://www.hsbc.com/insight/topics/the-vital-role-of-voluntary-carbon-markets) by HSBC argues that \u201cthe voluntary carbon market can be an incredible force for good that can help us accelerate the transition to a net zero economy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe force of good that VCMs can offer is providing offset solutions to major polluting industries. For instance, the VMC [Verra](https://verra.org/) has issued over 1.1 billion verified carbon credits consisting of over 2,000 project activities around the world and has been used in over 88 countries. A large sector that emits GHG is transportation. [Verra](https://registry.verra.org/app/search/VCS/Registered) has created a project activity standard where entities can be issued carbon credits through installation of electric vehicle charging stations.\n\n\nAs VCMs adapt and refine standards, they provide incentive for government, industry, and individuals to change behaviour and promotes innovation for our global emissions to reach net zero.\u00a0\n\n\n***You might also like:*** [***Is Carbon Offset a Form of Greenwashing?***](https://earth.org/is-carbon-offset-a-form-of-greenwashing/)\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) incentivize project developers to reach net zero through the reduction, avoidance, or removal of greenhouse gases (GHG).

The market can help us channel much-needed finance to drive climate action, conserve vital ecosystems, and support sustainable development and livelihoods in local communities. However, one of the leading challenges for companies is differentiating high-integrity carbon credits in a crowded marketplace. New integrity guidance is shedding light on how companies can make the highest impact investments to complement their sustainability commitments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhy is the conversation around carbon credits so complex and polarized? For good reason. For too long, the market has operated without overarching guidance to ensure these carbon credits truly deliver on their climate promises, and don\u2019t cause any unintended harm to people or nature. Intense media scrutiny has revealed bad actors and flawed practices, which has bruised public confidence in the market\u2019s capacity for positive climate action.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe integrity of carbon credits is essential for the voluntary carbon market to be effective in addressing climate change. Low-quality or fraudulent carbon credits could undermine the market and prevent it from delivering real climate benefits, not to mention potentially harm communities or ecosystems.\u00a0\n\nLuckily, the voluntary carbon market is at a potential turning point. New guidance and resources released this year aim to ensure carbon credits deliver the positive impacts they promise. Recently, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) released its Core Carbon Principles (CCPs), an anticipated set of principles that set a global threshold to define what a high-integrity carbon credit looks like.\u00a0\n\nWhat should companies and carbon credit buyers take away from the CCPs?\u00a0\n\n**1. Already in 2023, the ICVCM will use its Assessment Framework to assess whether types of carbon credits meet the high-integrity CCP criteria, and will start issuing CCP labels to credits in the market.** To qualify for the CCP label credits must fund projects to reduce and remove emissions that are:\u00a0\n\n* \u200b\u200b\u200bCompatible with a **transition to net zero.** The framework rules out projects that lock in fossil fuel emissions or technologies.\n* **Permanent.** Projects must compensate for any reversals that happen within 40 years.\n* **Additional.** Reductions and removals would not have happened without carbon credits.\n* **Robustly Quantified.** The emissions impact must be measured conservatively to minimize the risk of overestimation.\n* All new projects will have to put in place **robust social and environmental safeguards** that deliver **positive sustainable development impacts.**\n\n**2. CCP compliance is a starting point, not a finish line, for high integrity.** Further effort is needed to ensure the voluntary carbon market delivers on its potential for climate action, while benefiting communities and ecosystems. While the CCP\u2019s can serve as a starting point for identifying credit quality, it will still be up to companies and carbon credit buyers to continue due diligence efforts to ensure their carbon credits deliver the true impact they claim. \n\n**3. The next phase of the voluntary carbon market\u2019s journey must focus on inclusion,** particularly for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Indigenous People and Local Communities are key partners in the VCM, and should be involved in decision-making and governance processes as partners, not solely beneficiaries. Some progress has been made to consult and engage Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities in multi-stakeholder efforts like the ICVCM. However, these efforts must be strengthened to ensure IPLC stakeholders hold power in processes to develop standards and governance to drive higher integrity.\n\n**4. We need a clear pathway for high-quality credits from natural climate solutions (NCS)** to direct private sector finance to these integral climate projects. High-quality NCS projects such as tropical forest conservation are critical to providing the near-term mitigation needed to meet global climate goals. As the ICVCM continues to refine the CCPs, it is critical that ICVCM appropriate market signals on high quality NCS credits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHowever, the Integrity Council is not the only group making progress in guiding the way to high integrity. There are a number of resources available to help companies and other carbon credit buyers identify high-integrity carbon credits and make transparent claims around those credits.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese include:\u00a0\n\n* [The Carbon Credit Quality Initiative (CCQI)](https://carboncreditquality.org/): The CCQI is a global initiative that sets standards for carbon credit quality. The CCQI\u2019s standards cover a range of factors, including the project\u2019s environmental benefits, social and economic impacts, and governance. Users can explore the score of a carbon credit type using CCQI\u2019s interactive scoring tool to evaluate it across multiple quality considerations.\n* [The Tropical Forest Credit Integrity (TFCI) guide](https://tfciguide.org/): Eight norm-setting and Indigenous organizations produced the TFCI to help companies differentiate tropical forest credits by impact, quality, and scale. This resource is designed to provide companies with guidance on what high-quality tropical forest carbon credits look like so that they can participate in the voluntary carbon market with confidence and integrity.\n* The Voluntary Carbon Market Initiative\u2019s (VCMI) Claims Code of Practice: The recently updated VCMI Claims Code is a set of guidelines for making credible claims about the climate benefits of carbon credits. The Claims Code lays out a step-by-step process for making claims and identifies a set of consistent claims that companies can make with carbon credits. VCMI requires that companies purchase CCP-labeled carbon credits to back their climate claims, when these CCP-labeled credits become available.\n* The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi): The SBTi is an organization that develops standards for, and validates, science-aligned corporate climate targets. The SBTi strongly recommends that companies go above and beyond internal emissions reductions to engage in \u201cbeyond value chain mitigation\u201d (BVCM), including through the purchase of high-integrity carbon credits. The SBTi recently concluded a public consultation to guide their approach to BVCM, and will produce additional guidance on corporate BVCM approaches later this year.\n\nAll of these should be part of a buyer\u2019s consideration and due diligence process when using carbon credits in their climate strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe need for carbon credit quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market is clear. By using the resources and guidance that are available, companies and other carbon credit buyers can help to ensure that they are investing in high-quality carbon credits that truly achieve their climate goals and make a real difference for the climate.\u00a0\n\n*Want more info?

Global Carbon Council is the only international GHG crediting and sustainable development program in the Global South approved by United Nation\u2019s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Carbon Reduction and Offsetting Association (ICROA).   \n \nUnder the MoU, GCC and CCC will explore close collaboration and engagement with stakeholders in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as well as South Korea to expand the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). One of the key objectives of this collaboration is to support the issuance of Internationally Transferable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) for South Korea under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. By leveraging GCC's expertise in international GHG crediting, the MoU is aimed at facilitating South Korea's efforts in meeting its climate goals under the Paris Agreement.   \n \nAs part of the MoU, the two entities will explore opportunities for integrating GCC's Registry with AORA (Alliance for Our Responsible Action) - The South Korean VCM Platform launched by CCC last year. The MoU also emphasizes knowledge-sharing and capacity building as essential components of driving sustainable climate action. Accordingly, GCC and CCC will organize capacity building workshops and training programs for internal and external stakeholders, including government and private sector organizations in South Korea.   \n \nIn addition to capacity building, the two organizations will collaborate on best practices for developing baseline and monitoring methodologies and standardized baselines for Korea and the region, as applicable. Eventually, this will help establish uniform and transparent processes for measuring and verifying emissions reductions, ensuring credibility and integrity within the voluntary carbon market.   \n \nDr. Yousef Alhorr, Founding Chairman of GCC, said, \u201cThrough this MoU, we aim to expand the Voluntary Carbon Market in both South Korea and the MENA region, which will drive impactful emissions reduction initiatives regionally and globally. Leveraging   \n \nGCC's expertise in international GHG crediting, we wish to support South Korea in achieving its climate goals under the Paris Agreement, by making available issued carbon credits that may qualify as Internationally Transferable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs).\u201d   \n \nSigning the MoU, Dr. Yoo Young Sook, Chairperson of CCC and Former Minister of the Environment of the Republic of Korea, said, \"This collaboration will be a crucial opportunity for Climate Change Center by being part of the increasing flow of the global carbon market. It signifies an important stepping stone for various stakeholders to participate in climate change response activity.\u201d   \n \nShedding light on the outcome of linking GCC registry with AORA South Korean VCM Platform, Mr. Kishor Rajhansa, COO of GCC, said, \u201cThis integration will streamline and enhance the scale and efficiency of trading of GCC issued carbon credits for South Korean buyers, bolstering the effectiveness of the voluntary carbon market in South Korea.\u201d   \n \nThe MoU between GCC and CCC signals a powerful alliance in the fight against climate change, as both organizations combine their expertise and resources to drive tangible and sustainable climate solutions.   \n\n  \n\n\n[MENAFN01082023004332009164ID1106760565](https://menafn.com/1106760565/Global-Carbon-Council-and-Climate-Change-Center-to-expand-Voluntary-Carbon-Market-in-South-Korea-and-MENA)\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Portland Communications\n------------------------](https://portland-communications.com/)\n\n\n**Legal Disclaimer:**  \n [MENAFN](https://menafn.com) provides the information \u201cas is\u201d without warranty of any kind.

Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) released the long-awaited framework that provides guidance on defining what makes carbon credits of high quality, which can help boost the credibility of the [voluntary carbon market (VCM)](https://carboncredits.com/what-is-the-voluntary-carbon-market/).\u00a0\n\n\nICVCM\u2019s Assessment Framework is part of their [Core Carbon Principles (CCPs)](https://carboncredits.com/the-core-carbon-principles/) published last March. The framework will be used to assess if [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-understanding-carbon-credits/) adhere to its high-integrity CCPs. The CCPs include 10 codes categorized into three areas: governance; emissions impact and sustainable development.\n\n\nCCP-labeled credits will be available to buyers by the end of the year.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Integrity Council believes that with their new framework, the VCMs now have a global standard for quality by addressing market issues on confidence and integrity. Executives of the ICVCM highlight the importance of high-quality credits in reducing emissions and delivering global climate goals. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nICVCM assessment framework comments\n\n\n\nICVCM assessment framework comments\n\nCarbon Prices Recovering From A Dip\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe release of the guidance comes at a critical time for the **$2 billion** carbon market. The growing criticism over some carbon offset projects caused a sharp decline in market liquidity and carbon prices.\u00a0\n\n\nNature-based [carbon credit prices](https://carboncredits.com/carbon-prices-today/) (NGEO), in particular, are largely impacted.\n\n\n[![Nature Based Carbon](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20523%20477'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![Nature Based Carbon](https://carboncredits.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Nature-Based-Carbon.jpg)](https://carboncredits.com/carbon-prices-today/)\n\n\nBut with various initiatives introduced, carbon credit prices started to recover slowly. As per S&P Global Commodity Insights\u2019 Platts assessment, nature-based credit prices (Platts CNC) recovered from a record low of **$1/mtCO2e** in May to **$2.45/mtCO2e** in July. S&P Global data suggested that prices for the same credit reached an average of $9.55/mtCO2e last year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n![carbon credit prices S&P global Platts CNC](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201169%20625'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![carbon credit prices S&P global Platts CNC](https://carboncredits.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/carbon-credit-prices-SP-global.jpg)\n\nMany industry experts hope that this development will inspire more carbon removal and reduction efforts by bringing certainty to VCMs. But for a carbon credit to earn a CCP label, it has to go through two assessment levels.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### Program Level\n\n\nThis assessment framework and procedure were first released alongside the CCP guidelines. A dedicated \u201c[Assessment Platform](https://icvcm.org/assessment-platform/)\u201d is part of this second release specifically designed for crediting programs applying for CCP eligibility.\u00a0\n\n\nThe ICVCM refers to these programs as a \u201cstandard setting program that registers mitigation activities and issues carbon credits\u201d. Established programs are the Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry, and Verra\u2019s Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).\n\n\n* ### Carbon Credit Category Level\n\n\nThis is the newly released assessment guidance but the framework doesn\u2019t define yet what a \u2018Category\u2019 means. The Integrity Council will form a Categories Working Group (CWG) tasked to finalize the definition based on data gathered from rating agencies and publicly available information.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe CWG will recommend which categories must be prioritized for approval, which ones need further assessment, and which carbon credits don\u2019t deserve the CCP label.\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to the framework, carbon credits must support carbon projects that [align with net zero, additionality, permanent, and robustly quantified](https://icvcm.org/assessment-framework/).\u00a0\n\n\nThe goal of the framework is to ensure that the highest quality carbon credits prevail and get premium prices. The assessment process is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n![ICVCM assessment process](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20926%20510'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![ICVCM assessment process](https://carboncredits.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ICVCM-assessment-process.jpg)\n\nSome carbon crediting programs and standards are revisiting and making some changes in their methodologies.\n\n\nFor instance, the world\u2019s leading carbon registry, VCS, has been improving the quality of its forest carbon credits. The mostly used crediting program will finalize its [REDD+](https://carboncredits.com/what-is-redd-development-issues-and-solutions/) methodology by the last quarter of this year.\u00a0\n\n\nQuality Issues Remain, Framework to Strengthen\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhile some improvements are happening in the market, some experts still warn that quality issues of projects continue to persist.\u00a0\n\n\nOthers say that these efforts from ICVCM and similar initiatives aren\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d that can instantly resolve the issue of quality. Some say that the growing scrutiny of the VCM highlighted significant failures of the market to deliver at a project level. This has clearly impacted the supply of carbon credits as reported by S&P Global for different projects.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n![supply of carbon credits S&P](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201176%20630'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![supply of carbon credits S&P](https://carboncredits.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/supply-of-carbon-credits-SP.jpg)\n\nChart from S&P Global Commodity Insights\nStill, as major initiatives focus on the quality of the credits circulating in the market, improvements will happen soon. The Integrity Council will start forming various multi-stakeholder working groups to make things clear and strengthen the framework.\n\n\nThe [carbon market governance](https://carboncredits.com/carbon-credits-market-governance-and-initiatives/) body will also keep on updating its guidelines and frameworks over time. That means incorporating new developments, technological advances, and lessons learned into the updated version of the framework.\u00a0\n\n\nThe release of this initiative comes after the [VCMI launched its Claims Code of Practice](https://carboncredits.com/vcmi-claims-code-credible-carbon-credits/) just recently. It\u2019s a separate guideline seeking to make the demand side of the VCM more credible. The Code will help guide companies in using carbon credits to voluntarily offset their emissions.\n\n\nBoth VCMI and ICVCM aim for the same thing: to bring integrity to the VCM. They\u2019re also currently working to create an [integrated market integrity framework](https://carboncredits.com/vcmi-icvcm-market-integrity-framework/) aimed at improving carbon offset quality.\u00a0\n\n\nThe ICVCM will start announcing CCP-Eligible programs and CCP-Approved categories later this 2023, making CCP-labeled credits available for buyers before the year ends.\n\n\nWill this new threshold for quality bring prices of carbon credits up to premium? That\u2019s something to watch out for in the market once the CCP-labeled credits are up and running.\u00a0\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) has released a framework that provides guidance on defining high-quality carbon credits to boost the credibility of the voluntary carbon market (VCM).

S&P Global editors also focus on expectations of Europe\u2019s power utilities reporting strong Q2 earnings and a new framework announced to define high-quality carbon credits.\n\n\n**1. Permian gas prices decline, volatility to ease in coming months**\n\n\n![](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tetegd.jpg)\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? Gas prices across the Permian Basin dipped into negative territory in July 28 trading in what appeared to be a maintenance-related decline that also comes amid a midsummer rebound in gas production there. Although likely not attributable to a single cause, the sharp price dislocation for the West Texas gas market comes amid recent maintenance-related cuts to pipeline capacity around the Permian which have likely been further exacerbated by a sharp rebound in Permian gas production this month.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next? With at least two brownfield pipeline expansions on Permian Highway Pipeline and Whistler Pipeline scheduled to enter service by year end, producers in West Texas can look forward to some relief from price volatility in the months ahead. In the meantime, extended periods of high gas production, pipeline maintenance and/or low demand will pose a continuing risk for in-basin prices.\n\n\n**2. Europe\u2019s power utilities expected to report strong H1**\n\n\n![](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gret.jpg)\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? The market value of wind and solar output in Europe fell back close to pre-energy crisis levels in the second quarter of 2023. However, prices remain above the long-term average, mirroring the trends seen in wider power and gas markets in Europe.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next? Against this backdrop, equity analysts expect most of Europe\u2019s major utilities to continue their strong start to the year when they report their second-quarter earnings in July and August, with some even floating the possibility of full-year guidance upgrades on the back of a strong first half. While many companies may see earnings decline year over year, those with merchant generation or energy trading divisions will continue to reap the benefits of prices still at levels above the long-term average.\n\n\n**3. New quality guidance could support carbon credit liquidity**\n\n\n![](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rtete.jpg)\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market unveiled July 27 its assessment framework to define high-quality carbon offsets. The framework will be used to evaluate whether carbon credits meet the ICVCM\u2019s high-integrity Core Carbon Principles (CCPs). The guidance comes at a crucial juncture for the $2 billion voluntary carbon market. Growing scrutiny over the efficacy of some carbon offsets and projects had led to a sharp fall in both liquidity and prices.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next? The ICVCM said it will start establishing several multi-stakeholder working groups to assess different categories of carbon credits and associated crediting methodologies against the CCP criteria and recommend those that meet the threshold. Labeled credits will be available to buyers by end-2023. S&P Global analysts believe the ICVCM has now provided some clarity to the market but an upswing in prices and liquidity is unlikely till the first half of next year.\n\n\n**4. EU pig iron outlook bleak on slow steel recovery**\n\n\n![](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5yjykshh.jpg)\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? European steel mills\u2019 pig iron production in June has remained weaker on the year, cutting demand and spot activity for raw materials such as iron ore and pellets, coking coal and met coke. The decline in productivity has followed weaker steel prices and unforeseen stoppages at blast furnaces in France and Spain, partly compensated by production from other plants. Global pig iron volumes have seen stronger trends, with output in the rest of the world excluding the EU trending up over January-April and strengthening again in June following a sharp decline in China\u2019s output in May.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next? A recovery in pig iron production in Europe and Turkey may boost demand for iron ore and coking coal in the second half of 2023, with several blast furnaces restarting after checks in the first half. The overall impact on pig iron rates and spot demand for raw materials may be limited on weaker demand seen in H2 2022, with met coke stocks at mills rising during high gas prices. The European Steel Association (Eurofer) said that steel consumption is expected to grow slowly only from Q3 with a recovery in 2024 amid high uncertainty over regional steel demand. Eurofer downgraded regional apparent steel consumption in 2023 to a 3% decline, from an earlier forecast 1% contraction.  \n\nSource: [Platts]( https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/natural-gas/010823-ctracker-permian-europe-power-carbon-credit-pig-iron)\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Permian gas prices in negative territory due to maintenance-related decline and increased gas production.

It was given a platform recently at the European Parliament\u2019s \u201c[Beyond Growth](https://www.beyond-growth-2023.eu/)\u201d conference.\n\n\nJason Hickel, an economic anthropologist and one of the [main advocates](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/23/developing-poor-countries-de-develop-rich-countries-sdgs) of degrowth, [defines](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14747731.2020.1812222?journalCode=rglo20) it as\n\n\n\n> \n> a planned reduction of energy and resource use designed to bring the economy back into balance with the living world in a way that reduces inequality and improves human wellbeing.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe [degrowth movement\u2019s](https://degrowth.info/degrowth) belief is that other approaches to the ecological crisis, such as [green growth](https://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/whatisgreengrowthandhowcanithelpdeliversustainabledevelopment.htm#:%7E:text=Green%20growth%20means%20fostering%20economic,which%20our%20well%2Dbeing%20relies.) and the [sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), are futile. That\u2019s because these approaches are rooted in [democratic capitalism](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-martin-wolf-issues-a-wakeup-call-on-the-state-of-democratic-capitalism), which is obsessed with economic growth.\n\n\nTherefore the movement [calls for](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00045608.2014.973803?journalCode=raag20) a \u201cradical political project\u201d that would displace capitalism and \u201cde-grow\u201d the west. The global south is exempt.\n\n\nSo far, the economic mainstream has been dismissive of degrowth, considering it perhaps not even worth engaging with. Critical analyses by [Ted Nordhaus](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/must-growth-doom-the-planet) and other leading economists such as [Branko Milanovic](https://degrowth.info/library/the-illusion-of-degrowth-in-a-poor-and-unequal-world) and [Andrew MacAfee](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-why-degrowth-is-the-worst-idea-on-the-planet/) remains confined to blog-style pieces.\n\n\nThe degrowth movement does, however, raise very valid criticisms against economic growth and the Green Growth paradigm that underpins the current mainstream approach to tackling the ecological crisis.\n\n\nBut do they offer valid solutions? Are the only two options facing us either ecological collapse or degrowth? Will degrowth save the world as Jason Hickel confidently [proclaims](https://www.jasonhickel.org/less-is-more)?\n\n\nIn several recent scholarly papers, published by the [IZA Institute of Labor Economics](https://www.iza.org/person/8708/wim-naude), I argue that the proposal for [degrowth is not a solution](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16139/melancholy-hues-the-futility-of-green-growth-and-degrowth-and-the-inevitability-of-societal-collapse) for the ecological crisis or for the shortcomings of democratic capitalism.\n\n\nDegrowth would be ineffective and might be even [worse for the environment](https://medium.com/@wimnaude/the-degrowth-movement-ecological-iatrogenics-6a7c2a54cf1b). Degrowth in industrialised countries would hit developing countries hard because of economic interdependencies.\n\n\nThe west has been experiencing [degrowth conditions](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16191/we-already-live-in-a-degrowth-world-and-we-do-not-like-it) (the \u201cgreat stagnation\u201d) for decades. This experiment has resulted in many social and political ills. The degrowth movement itself is a [reaction](https://illuminem.com/illuminemvoices/the-degrowth-movement-is-a-reaction-against-degrowth) against degrowth.\n\n\n### Flaws in the argument\n\n\n[Proponents of degrowth](https://degrowth.info/degrowth) argue that reducing the gross domestic product (GDP) of advanced economies would cut carbon emissions enough to avoid an ecological overshoot.\n\n\nBut my argument is that merely reducing the GDP of developed countries would have no significant impact on the world\u2019s overall material footprint.\n\n\n[Most](https://www.cgdev.org/media/developing-countries-are-responsible-63-percent-current-carbon-emissions) current carbon emissions (63%) come from developing countries where emissions will continue to increase. China, for example, is building the equivalent of [two](https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/china-permits-two-new-coal-power-plants-per-week-in-2022/) new coal-fired power plants every week.\n\n\nMany of the world\u2019s major carbon pollutors \u2014 fossil fuel companies \u2014 are located in the global south. They include Saudi Aramco, National Iranian Oil, Petroleos Mexicanos, PetroChina, Petroleos de Venezuela and Kuwait Petroleum.\n\n\nThey are also government owned or controlled, which makes it rather strange that Jason Hickel is advocating [nationalisation](https://twitter.com/jasonhickel/status/1330445163819380737) of fossil fuel companies as a degrowth-solution\u2026\n\n\nDegrowth considers the global south to be exempt from degrowth. This is an implicit acknowledgement that degrowth can do harm.\n\n\nThe movement has also [argued](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1057/s41301-023-00360-9?sharing_token=rW47li8tlUMeiCE_UD4KM1xOt48VBPO10Uv7D6sAgHv-DJSGIlutQg2eSUTMreNALHUql2pXjyM_N0mR30sNTJjmmQPBjmSkdFwNIqbJ-29qoVvqm0bQ4yMwghzbQ2kA9XztfHjrfrbAWFM2twf_oeEpn0-UxiwwaAZGc5K4Vn8=) that developed countries should compensate the global south. This implies giving a free pass to global south polluters whose fossil fuel rich governments will get trillions in reparation money to further invest in their polluting industries.\n\n\nDegrowth would also be ineffective. Most of its key proposals are likely to stimulate economic growth and consumption, not curtail it. For example, the degrowth movement calls for energy [sufficiency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620300165), basic income [grants](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2023-04-03-basic-income-grant-modelling-shows-how-to-do-it-as-a-boost-to-the-economy/) and [four-day](https://theconversation.com/five-reasons-why-the-four-day-week-wont-work-188188) working weeks. It proposes [banning](https://ontgroei.degrowth.net/policies-for-degrowth/) advertising.\n\n\nAll of these may be subject to [rebound effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622007685) \u2014 they would actually stimulate economic growth and materialisation of the economy.\n\n\nBut degrowth might not only be ineffective in reducing ecological overshoot. It might turn out to be [dirty](https://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/van-den-bergh_degrowth-and-a-growth.pdf).\n\n\nFirst, redistribution towards less developed countries, as degrowth proposes, would stimulate economic growth and aggregate consumption growth in developing countries. Strangely, although degrowthers reject [neoclassical economic growth theory](https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/development-theory/The-neoclassical-counterrevolution), they seem to adhere to its tenet that redistribution has no effect on economic growth.\n\n\nSecond, with reduced income, developed countries would have fewer resources to invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies. Degrowthers may counter that countries could just reallocate their expenditure away from conspicuous consumption towards such green investment.\n\n\nBut that would be inconsistent with the [fact](https://www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/2022/) that the [most innovative](https://www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/2022/) countries are not Jason Hickel\u2019s [poster-children](https://twitter.com/jasonhickel/status/1546844818772529159) such as Sri Lanka or Cuba, but those with the highest GDP, such as the USA and Switzerland. Innovation costs money.\n\n\nKate Raworth is therefore mistaken when she [claims](https://euobserver.com/growth-week/157013) that \u201cboundaries unleash creativity.\u201d\n\n\nWith resources and innovation under degrowth pressure, firms might simply [replace](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/degrowth-delusion/) expensive cleaner production techniques with cheaper, but more polluting ones. And without future growth, debt would contract, starving risky but necessary investment projects.\n\n\nThe upshot is that degrowth would leave the world more vulnerable to the impacts of ecological deterioration.\n\n\nDegrowth might also harm developing countries because of the intertwined nature of the global economy. This might disproportionately hurt the poorest of the poor \u2014 and make global inequality worse.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis emphasised this inter-dependency. Poverty rose more sharply in the global south than in the global north. The impact of the pandemic indicated how difficult it would be for the south to decouple from the north.\n\n\n### Degrowth and dictatorship\n\n\nBecause of these shortcomings, degrowth is politically [unfeasible](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22408556/save-planet-shrink-economy-degrowth). Democracy and degrowth are inherently uncomfortable bedfellows. The only example in history of a sustainable and thriving stationary (non-growing) society was Japan during the Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603-1868). It was, however, a \u201c[brutal dictatorship](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-29038-2)\u201d.\n\n\nGiven that a democracy is unlikely to choose degrowth voluntarily, the degrowth movement may set the west on a dangerous path towards rejecting democracy and reverting to an authoritarian collective.\n\n\nThe degrowth movement thinks that material use and carbon emissions cannot be decoupled from economic growth, but that innovation, creativity, happiness and social progress can. This ignores how much social progress has accompanied the last two centuries of economic growth.\n\n\nThe physicist Tom Murphy, who has stressed the [limits](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01652-6) to economic growth, has [warned](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2015/09/you-call-this-progress/) that\n\n\n\n> \n> In times of plenty, we can afford to be kind to those who are different. We are less threatened when we are comfortable. If our 21st Century standard of living peaks [\u2026] then we may not have the luxury of viewing our social progress as an irreversible ratchet. Hard times revive old tribal instincts: different is not welcome.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Ted Nordhaus as a Nobel Prize winner.

It was at Kyoto that participating countries set up the\ntarget to restrict and control the emission of GHG by setting\nemission reduction targets. With that aim in mind, at COP 26\nparticipating countries agreed to take significant steps towards\nfuture of carbon markets.\n\n\nCountries and Multinational National Corporations (MNCs) across\nthe globe have been developing strategies for lowering GHG\nemissions and achieving a net-zero position. MNCs are evolving\nstrategies to different regulations across different countries in\nthe form of carbon taxes and emission trading systems, and various\ndisclosure requirements.\n\n\nMNCs are making large investments to meet their environmental\nand sustainability goals. Accordingly, their transfer pricing\nissues are gaining importance. These issues include but are not\nlimited to change in supply chain structure(s) to make it more\nenvironment efficient, how to allocate the costs associated with\nenvironmental advancements, implementation of best structure for\nsourcing or trading carbon offsets etc., depending on the MNCs\nobjectives and net emission goals.\n\n\nThis article discusses carbon trading and its considerations\nwhich will affect the **[transfer\npricing](https://www.coinmen.com/transfer-pricing-services/) strategies** and policies of the MNCs.\n\n\n### What is Carbon Trading\n\n\nCarbon trading has been a hot topic in the world of business and\nsustainability for a couple of years now. Carbon trading is a tool\nthat businesses can use to offset their carbon emissions and reduce\ntheir overall carbon footprint. It is seen as an effective way to\nreduce GHG emissions and help companies achieve their carbon\nreduction goals.\n\n\nTo simplify, Carbon trading involves a system of trading carbon\ncredits. Carbon credits are legal tradeable certificates that\npermit right to emit one ton of carbon or carbon dioxide\nequivalent. Companies that have reduced their GHG emissions can\nsell their credits to other companies who may not have been able to\nreduce their emissions to the same extent. This purchase of carbon\ncredit exhibits carbon offsets. Carbon credits can be traded in\ninternational markets at prevailing market prices. This system\nhelps incentivize companies to lower their emissions and rewards\nthose who have made efforts to do so.\n\n\n![1350404.jpg](/images/article_images/1350404.jpg)\n\n\nAt group level, carbon trading helps groups to minimize their\noverall group carbon tax liability i.e., in countries where carbon\ntaxes are levied, companies can use transfer pricing planning and\nintra group carbon offsets to minimize their group carbon tax\nliability.\n\n\n### Carbon Trading across the world\n\n\nThere are several carbon trading markets operating around the\nworld, both Compliance (Regulated) and Non-Compliance (Voluntary).\nCompliance markets are created owing to policy or regulatory\nrequirements. Under this market, credits are underlined by\nverification and regulatory processes, and are widely traded on\nnational and international markets. Some of the largest compliance\ncarbon markets in the world include The European Union Emissions\nTrading System, China's Emissions Trading System, The Regional\nGreenhouse Gas Initiative in the United States, The New South Wales\nEmissions Trading Scheme in Australia etc.\n\n\nThe prices of carbon credits in compliance markets can vary\ndepending on factors such as supply \u2013 demand for credits, the\nseverity of the emissions reduction targets, and the general\neconomic outlook. As more and more companies are looking to reduce\ntheir emissions, the prices of credits are seeing an upward\ntrend.\n\n\nVoluntary carbon markets have developed independently of\ngovernment targets and policies. It provides a market for companies\nto buy and sell carbon offsets. Some of the voluntary carbon\nmarkets in the world are The American Carbon Registry, The Climate\nAction Reserve etc.\n\n\nThe prices of carbon credits in voluntary markets can also vary\ndepending on factors such as the type of project that generated the\ncredits, the quality of the said project, and the demand for\ncredits from buyers.\n\n\nIn India, at present, Carbon is being traded on India's\nMulti Commodity Exchange. However, Ministry of Power released a\ndraft of the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) in March 2023. The\ndraft establishes the institutional framework and mechanisms for\nthe functioning of the Indian carbon credit market. The scheme will\nlikely cover a number of sectors including power, industry and\ntransportation, and the government is likely to set a cap on\nemissions for each sector. It will be a compliance market and the\nprices will likely be determined basis supply and demand.\n\n\n### How it may lead to restructuring in an MNC\n\n\nStakeholder concerns, disclosures and financial disincentives\nare pushing MNCs to lower their GHG emissions. MNCs are likely to\nbuild green teams \u2013 in the form of people having expertise in\ncarbon dealings \u2013 like central carbon team (for the purpose\nof this article, let's call specialised central carbon team as\n'green team').\n\n\nTo effectively manage intra-group transfers and transfer\npricing, many MNCs are in process of establishing their green teams\nif not already. One approach to carbon trading is through\nintra-group transfer pricing planning, where companies can use the\ncarbon credits generated by one division to offset the emissions of\nanother. This process allows companies to utilise carbon credits\ngenerated internally, rather than purchasing them from external\nentities.\n\n\nGreen team shall monitor carbon emissions and credits, provide\nguidance and supervision to ensure that the carbon credits are\ngenerated correctly and that all divisions of the company are\nutilising them effectively. This approach can also help increase\nthe efficiency of the company's sustainability strategy,\nleading to cost savings and improved performance.\n\n\n### Role of Transfer Pricing in structuring\n\n\nThe concept of intra-group transfer pricing is not new, however,\nits application to carbon trading is a recent development and\nsomething to keep an eye on. The following paragraphs discusses\nconsiderations to deliberate before setting up transfer pricing\npolicies for services provided by the green teams.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, let's understand what functions shall be\nprovided by the green team. In simple words, green teams are\nexpected to have functions like understanding the carbon markets,\nexecuting transactions like purchase and sale of intragroup carbon\ncredits, verification of earned credits, purchase and sale of\ncarbon credits on the markets, managing compliances for the group,\nensuring that group maximises returns from carbon trading and\nminimises emissions, have specialised knowledge of the industry,\nstay abreast with evolving regulations, assist internal teams in\naccounting and legal issues etc.\n\n\nGiven the above, dealings with green team can be divided into\nfollowing two major buckets of transaction:\n\n\nA. Trading Activities: Acting as a group trading entity\n\n\nAs a group trading company, green team shall perform functions\nsuch as buy and sell of carbon credits, maintain surplus inventory\nof carbon credits to meet the future demands, provide financing\nservices, performing hedging functions, advising group entities on\nways to reduce emissions, etc. Each service provided by the green\nteam needs to be identified and remunerated in a manner that is\nconsistent with the arms' length principle.\n\n\nWhile designing transfer pricing policy for above, following\npoints should be considered:\n\n\n* MNCs should consider appropriate market prices of carbon\ncredits (like spot pricing or norm pricing, if available) while\nundertaking the trading activities.\n* Where the green team provides financing (in the form of extra\ncredit period etc.), the MNC may consider adding an appropriate\nmarket interest rate for the extra credit period in the\nabove-mentioned market price\n* Intra group services' paragraph discusses considerations\nfor intra group services.\n\n\nIt is important to consider that, where green team acts as a\nfull risk bearing trading entity. The purpose of this entity is to\nearn additional income for the MNC. However, as a full risk bearing\nentity the green team may also incur losses. Accordingly, it is\ncritical to ensure that green team is equipped to bear these risks\nand employs qualified team with specialised knowledge.\n\n\nB. Intra Group Services: Acting as a Service entity\n\n\nCertain services provided by green team shall be administrative\nin nature such as assisting internal teams in accounting and legal\nissues, managing administrative compliances etc. Whereas certain\nservices shall be specialised in nature such as strategizing\nminimising emissions, pooling services, facilitating buying and\nselling of credits as an agent etc.\n\n\nAccordingly, the group transfer pricing policy is required to\nensure that services are appropriately identified, and their\nrelated costs are appropriately allocated within the group in\naccordance with the arms' length principle.\n\n\nFor specialised services it will be important to establish the\nfunctions, assets, and risk of the green team and accordingly\narms' length renumeration should be fixed.\n\n\nThe MNC may consider a cost-plus model. An arms' length\nmargin may be fixed and updated annually. For allocation of cost,\nMNC may consider the following allocation keys such as:\n\n\n* Respective carbon emission goals. For instance \u2013\nmanufacturing entities of the MNC has goal of reduction of 50\ntonnes of GHG emissions annually, whereas service entities of the\nentity have goal of reducing 10 tonnes of GHG emissions\nannually.\n* Respective buy-sell basis i.e., carbon credits bought and sold.\nFor instance, total units bought and sold by the group entities may\nbe considered as an allocation unit.\n* A hybrid of both -where certain part is fixed depending on\ncarbon emission goals while remaining is fixed depending upon\ncarbon credits bought or sold. For instance, MNC may follow 50-50\nratio of carbon emission goals and buy sell basis for allocation\nkey. Allocation key may be fixed 50% of individual emission goals\nand 50% of respective buy sell units.\n\n\nIt is important to note that, the selection of the appropriate\nallocation key will depend on the individual facts of the case like\nin the industry group is working in, the supply chain of the\ntransaction, nature of the services etc.\n\n\nLet's take example of green team acting as service provider\nin the form of buying/selling agent. In this case green team may be\nrequired purchase carbon credits from open market or purchase by\nmoving carbon credits among different related parties. In the given\ncase, the green team does not own the carbon credits, it is a\nservice provider that facilitates transfer of internal resources or\narrange from external resources wherever required and perform\nrelated compliances. The team performing such functions is expected\nto have expertise in such functions. An important consideration\nwhile fixing the arms' length remuneration shall be to identify\nwhich entity bears the market risk for fluctuations in price of\ncarbon credits. In the given case, green team may consider a\ncost-plus model. An arms' length margin may be fixed. For\nallocation of costs, MNC may consider allocation keys on either buy\nsell basis or a hybrid basis.\n\n\nFor administrative services such as assistance in accounting and\nauditing etc, the MNCs may also consider electing simplified\napproach of low value-added services in accordance with OECD\nTransfer Pricing Guidelines 2022. It will reduce compliance effort\nand cost and provide greater certainty to the MNC.\n\n\n### Other factors that need to be considered while designing the\nappropriate transfer pricing policy for green team are as\nfollows:\n\n\n* First and foremost, we need to consider that, the transfer\npricing policy decisions regarding services from green team shall\nbe considering the underlying business of the MNC and different\nregions in which they operate. For example, transfer pricing policy\nfor green team of consulting services shall be different from a\nmanufacturing company.\n* It is not far-fetched to state that to minimise the GHG\nemissions and to achieve carbon neutrality, it is expected that the\nMNCs shall go through global business restructurings\n\u2013movement of people within the groups, change in location of\nmanufacturing units, introduction and developments of new\ntechnologies, etc. All these issues will also have transfer pricing\nimplications and same need to be considered and planned\ncarefully.\n* Last but not the least, while deliberating the structure it is\nrequired that condition of economic substance is met. It is\ncritical to ensure green team has the ability in the form of\nspecialised team and decision-making powers. The compliance with\nthe necessary economic substance requires not only that green team\nis localized in the company jurisdiction but that effectively the\ndecisions and meetings are taken and held in the relevant\njurisdiction.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\nThe world is changing, and so are the challenges we face. One of\nthe greatest challenges we face as a global community is climate\nchange. Carbon emissions contribute significantly to climate\nchange, and businesses around the world are beginning to take\nresponsibility for their carbon footprint. It is encouraging to see\ncompanies around the world taking a proactive approach to reducing\ntheir carbon footprint.\n\n\nWith the help of green teams and carbon offsetting, businesses\ncan take meaningful steps towards minimizing their overall group\ncarbon tax liability while also creating a greener future for\nall.\n\n\nIn summary, carbon trading can be an effective way for companies\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time, minimize\ntheir overall group carbon tax liability. However, it requires\ncareful planning and management of transfer pricing policies for\nintra group transactions such as transfers, services etc., to\nensure compliance with regulations and best practices. Proper\ntransfer pricing strategy ensures that intra-group transactions are\npriced fairly and in line with independent scenario. With the right\nstrategy and team in place, carbon trading can help businesses\nachieve their sustainability goals and reduce their carbon\nfootprint.\n\n\n*The content of this article is intended to provide a general\nguide to the subject matter.

These include emissions relating to goods and services the NHS purchases through its suppliers. In connection with this goal, NHS suppliers will be required to provide greenhouse gas emissions data, set emissions reduction targets and measure the carbon footprint of individual products. In this Alert, we provide an overview of current and forthcoming NHS supplier obligations relating to carbon reduction.\n\n\nTo help ensure that NHS suppliers align with its net zero target, in late 2021, the NHS approved a Net Zero Supplier Roadmap. The Roadmap details the steps suppliers must take to be eligible to receive NHS contracts. Earlier this year, the NHS published *Carbon Reduction Plan Requirements for the Procurement of NHS Goods, Services and Works* to provide further details to NHS suppliers on the implementation of milestones in the Roadmap.\n\n\n#### Phase-in Timeline\n\n\nThe Roadmap indicates the steps suppliers will be required to take to be eligible to receive NHS contracts. Milestones include the following:\n\n\n* Since **April 2022**, the Roadmap has required NHS to apply a minimum 10% net zero and social value weighting to all procurements (i.e., requiring at least 10% of the valuation of a potential procurement to be based on factors relating to the procurement\u2019s carbon footprint or social impact). Such factors are determined based on the type of product or service being procured and are scored based on questionnaire responses provided by the supplier.\n* Since **April 2023**, for all contracts above \u00a35 million per year (excluding VAT), the NHS has required suppliers to publish a Carbon Reduction Plan (CRP) for, at a minimum, their UK scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and a subset of scope 3 emissions.\n* Starting **April 2024**, the NHS will extend the CRP requirement to all NHS procurements, regardless of contract size or value.\n* From **April 2027**, the NHS will require suppliers to publish a CRP for global scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions that is aligned with the NHS\u2019s net zero target.\n* From **April 2028**, the NHS will introduce new carbon footprinting requirements for individual products supplied to the NHS. The NHS will work with suppliers and regulators to determine the scope and methodology of these requirements.\n* From **April 2030**, suppliers will be able to qualify for NHS contracts only if they can demonstrate their progress through published progress reports and continued carbon emissions reporting through the Evergreen Sustainable Supplier Assessment, an online self-assessment and reporting tool that enables suppliers to share sustainable information with the NHS and provides suppliers with a sustainability score against NHS priorities.\n\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, where suppliers have an acceptable reason for being unable to provide required emissions data, they can provide a CRP with the data that is available. To comply with this exception, suppliers must (1) include an explanation as to why more fulsome data is not available and (2) indicate the steps they will take to improve data collection. The sufficiency of the explanation will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n#### Carbon Reduction Plan Requirements\n\n\nA CRP must identify the supplier\u2019s carbon footprint and the supplier\u2019s plan for achieving net zero emissions. The CRP must include the following:\n\n\n* Confirmation of the supplier\u2019s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier for its UK operations. Although not required, the NHS encourages suppliers to set a 2045 net zero target.\n* The supplier\u2019s current GHG emissions for its UK operations (at a minimum), covering scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and at least the following scope 3 emissions categories:\n\n\n\t+ Upstream transportation and distribution (category 4);\n\t+ Waste generated in operations (category 5);\n\t+ Business travel (category 6);\n\t+ Employee commuting (category 7); and\n\t+ Downstream transportation and distribution (category 9).\n* Emissions in CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) for the seven greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol (i.e., carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride).\n* Environmental management measures in effect, including certification scheme or specific carbon reduction measures that have been adopted by the supplier. These should be measures the supplier can apply when performing the contract and that will support the supplier in achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier.\n\n\nThe reporting period cannot fall more than 12 months prior to the commencement of the procurement. The CRP must be updated annually.\n\n\nThe CRP must also be:\n\n\n* Board approved (or, if there is no board in place, company director approved); and\n* Clearly marked and published on the supplier\u2019s website.\n\n\nThe CRP should be specific to the bidding entity. However, a CRP may instead be provided at the parent company level if:\n\n\n* The bidding entity is wholly owned by the parent;\n* The commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 for UK operations is set out in the CRP for the parent, which includes a statement that the commitment will apply to the bidding entity;\n* The environmental measures set out in the CRP are stated to apply to the bidding entity in performance of the relevant contract; and\n* The CRP is published on the bidding entity\u2019s website.\n\n\nThe National Health Service has published a technical standard for preparing CRPs and completing the NHS\u2019s Carbon Reduction Plan Template. \n\n\n#### Assessment of the CRP\n\n\nThe CRP will be subject to a pass/fail assessment at the selection stage of the NHS procurement process. The assessment is intended to ensure that the CRP meets the NHS\u2019s requirements. If a CRP does not meet the minimum requirements, the supplier generally will not be able to proceed in the procurement process. The NHS is offering a free CRP Checking Service to provide suppliers feedback until September 30.\n\n\nWhere the application of the CRP requirements is not relevant or proportionate, including in civil emergencies and cases where the market for a particular type of contract is significantly limited such that delivery of public services is at risk or value for money is severely compromised, an NHS organization may proceed with a supplier regardless of its fulfilment of CRP requirements.\n\n\n#### About our Practice\n\n\nRopes & Gray has a leading ESG, CSR, and business and human rights compliance practice.

The basic approach of CBAM is that when goods from third countries are imported into the EU, they should bear a levy equal to the CO2 costs of EU manufacturers.\u00a0\n\n\nWithin his presentation, Andreas explained that it has taken a long time for CBAM to be introduced, but the formal adoption by the European Parliament was confirmed on 18th April 2023 and the CBAM regulation was published in the Official Journal on 16th May 2023 (L130/52). The CBAM regulation will concern imports originating from third countries into the EU, with the exception of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. \u201cThe decisive factor is the origin of the goods,\u201d highlighted Andreas. \u201cIf the goods are produced in third party countries and then exported via Switzerland into the EU, for example, the CBAM obligations will be fully enforced.\u201d![](/media/43738/ffm-news-image-622.jpg)\n\n\nAndreas also pointed out that there is an option in the regulation that in the future, if a third country has a CO2 pricing system that is comparable to the EU system, then that country might be exempted, which could be relevant for the UK.\u00a0 \u201cAs far as I know, the UK has only just started consultation in March regarding a similar regulation, so it is unclear whether they would be exempted in the future,\u201d mentioned Andreas.\n\n\nHe also wanted to make it clear that CBAM does not involve all goods, only those listed in Annex 1 of the CBAM regulation. This includes products defined by CN codes of foreign trade statistics, such as cement, electrical energy, fertilsiers, hydrogen, aluminium, iron and steel (except ferro-alloys and scrap), as well as certain products made of iron and steel, including all fasteners (both carbon steel and stainless steel) listed under CN code 7318.\n\n\nAndreas also made it clear that there is a clear political will within the European Commission to expand the number of goods covered by the regulation in the future, but it would not be before 2026/27.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen will CBAM be implemented?\n\n\nNext up Andreas explained that CBAM will be implemented in two stages \u2013 the transition phase and the implementation phase. \u201cThe transition phase is primarily looking to set-up the whole system; to create the necessary authorities; and to start collecting the data \u2013 helping make the process clear to all the market participants,\u201d explained Andreas. \u201cThe official start of the transition phase is January 2024, but there are some reporting obligations that will relate to Q4 of 2023. However, there will be no financial obligations during this transition phase.\u201d\n\n\nThe full implementation phase of CBAM starts in 2026, at which point companies will need to comply with all obligations regarding registration, reporting and compliance, as they will become compulsory.\n\n\nWhat will companies need to do?\n\n\nAndreas highlighted that importers \u2013 who import goods during any given quarter after 1st October 2023 \u2013 will need to submit a CBAM report to the European Commission, no later than one month after the end of the quarter in question. \u201cFor instance, for the fourth quarter of 2023, importers will need to submit a report no later than 31st January 2024.\u201d\n\n\nWhen it came to what needs to be included in the CBAM report, Andreas was clear that it is only parts (a) and (b) that were relevant to the fastener sector. \u201cFor the report you need to include part (a), which is the total quantity of each type of goods in tonnes, specified for each installation producing the goods in the country of origin. This means it is not enough to just mention the producer, you need to mention each installation where the goods are produced.\u201d\n\n\nWhen asked to clarify what installation meant, Andreas said his understanding was that it would relate to each factory or plant a single company had to produce fasteners. \u201cThe term \u2018installation\u2019 in the regulation, I believe, relates to every plant/factory where a product is produced. So, if there are several plants on one site then I believe you would have to report data for each plant on that site \u2013 not just for the one location \u2013 as the emission data for each plant might differ. However, this is not 100% clear and needs to be clarified.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\nAnother aspect of the report that importers will need to include is part (b), which is the actual total embedded emissions, expressed in tonnes of CO2, per tonne of each type of good.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are two other aspects of the report that Andreas pointed out do not relate to fastener products. Firstly, the indirect emissions aspect, as there is an exemption for steel products, and the other aspect is carbon price due in the country of origin for the embedded emissions, which doesn\u2019t apply as there is no common carbon price in any country.\u00a0\n\n\nHow are emissions defined?\n\n\nWhen it came to working out how emissions are defined for producing fasteners, Andreas referred to Annex 4 of the CBAM regulation, which says steel and steel products are classed as \u2018complex goods\u2019 and for these products emissions are defined as two components \u2013 attributed emissions (caused directly by the production process) and embedded emissions (the input materials consumed in the production process).\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cFor both components, only emissions within the system boundaries are to be considered, which is not so easy to define when it comes to fasteners and the production of steel,\u201d mentioned Andreas. \u201cFor example, you have coke, iron ore, and other elements, that go into the production of steel. This is why defining system boundaries of the production process is one of the main tasks of the coming implementing acts, as it is still not clear.\u201d![](/media/43739/ffm-news-image-623.jpg)\n\n\n\u201cFor fasteners, the focus will be on the CO2 emissions from the fastener production itself and from the production of steel used for producing the fasteners,\u201d clarified Andreas. \u201cHowever, there are a lot of detailed questions that have still not been answered, which is why in the CBAM regulation the European Commission has been empowered to adapt implementing acts with further details, especially the information to be reported; the format of the reporting; as well as detailed information of emissions per country and for the different goods.\u201d\n\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is still a lot of missing details and a lot of implementing acts that need to be published. Hopefully these will come by Q3 of 2023, but until then there are still many questions that need to be answered or explained.\u201d\n\n\nWhat should importers start doing?\n\n\nWhilst importers have until 2026 before the implementation phase begins, Andreas was clear that companies need to\u00a0start working on defining roles within businesses when it comes to CBAM, especially with the transition phase starting in the third quarter of 2023. \u201cIt is essential that importers define the responsibilities within their company, as there will be several implementing acts with further details being introduced in the coming months,\u201d highlighted Andreas. \u201cThese need to be followed closely for any potential impacts on your company.\u201d\n\n\nHe continued: \u201cThere also needs to be somebody who takes over the internal coordination and checking of the progress when it comes to CBAM reporting. As of 1st October companies are going to need to record the CBAM related goods they receive, which will need to be divided into CN codes, country of origin and by each manufacturing plant for each supplier. This might not prove easy to begin with, so planning now is essential. You will also need to be in touch with your suppliers and understand what information they already have available regarding their carbon footprint.\u201d\n\n\nPotential hurdles for companies when it comes to reporting the data is the difficulty in reporting the emissions values. \u201cThere is no standard method for calculating the carbon emissions either in the manufacturing of steel or in the manufacturing of fasteners,\u201d explained Andreas. \u201cTherefore, in most cases, there will not be exact data immediately. There will also be large variances between different companies and different factories of individual companies. Another factor is when it comes to the steel for fasteners, this can be made via a blast furnace or electric arc furnace \u2013 both routes are possible and the carbon footprint of each differs widely.\u201d\n\n\nOne option that Andreas highlighted is for importers to wait for more implementation acts to be published, as this might provide standard values \u2013 making it a lot easier for companies, as they do not need to collect emissions data for each of their products, which could prove extremely time consuming. \u201cThe potential issue with waiting for the standard values is how they will be calculated and set,\u201d warned Andreas. \u201cCBAM was planned only for products that are participating in the European Emission Trading System, which is true for steel but not for fasteners. This means all the products already in the European Emission Trading System will have default values, but fasteners will not \u2013 so they still need to be established, which will not be an easy task and could lead to inaccurate default values.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAndreas underlined that if the CBAM regulation is not followed then there are penalties that can be enforced from 2026. \u201cIn case of missing, incomplete or incorrect CBAM reports, the importer will be asked to correct them,\u201d mentioned Andreas. \u201cHowever, if the necessary steps to correct CBAM reports are not taken, or importers have failed to comply with the obligation to submit a report, the competent national authority should impose an \u2018effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalty on the importer\u2019. Whilst the amount of fine has not been determined yet, this wording within the regulation would suggest the penalty will not be a small amount.\u201d\n\n\nOutlook for the implementation phase\n\n\nFor the next part of his presentation Andreas talked through the steps involved during the implementation phase \u2013 including becoming a registered and authorised \u2018declarant\u2019; the need to purchase CBAM certificates in advance and how they will work; the reporting of CBAM declarations to the CBAM registry; the need to ensure the reported emissions are verified by an accredited verifier; as well as the determination of these emission values and how the preference is for third party manufacturers to register in the CBAM registry \u2013 inputting their own verified emissions data, which can then be used by accredited CBAM registrants.\n\n\n\u201cThe full implementation phase may seem far away, but the transition phase starts in October and there will be a lot of implementing acts introduced and details confirmed over the coming months and years, so companies need to focus on this now,\u201d stated Andreas.\u00a0 \u201cCBAM is not just \u2018another levy\u2019. It will lead to massive changes in importing for all involved, which is why companies need to start focusing on it today.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n[www.efda-fastenerdistributors.org](https://www.efda-fastenerdistributors.org)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSave and share\n* ![](/media/add.svg)\n* ![](/media/Twitter.svg)\n* ![](/media/facebook.svg)\n* ![](/media/LinkedIn.svg)\n* [![](/media/email.svg)](mailto:?subject=EFDA%20%20webinar%20on%20the%20impact%20%20of%20CBAM&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastenerandfixing.com%2Finsight%2Fefda-webinar-on-the-impact-of-cbam%2F)\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The European Fastener Distributor Association (EFDA) held a webinar on the impact of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article provides general information about the webinar."}, {"summary": "CBAM, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will require imported goods into the EU to bear a levy equal to the CO2 costs of EU manufacturers.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The implementation of CBAM may impose financial burdens on importers."}, {"summary": "CBAM will be implemented in two stages: a transition phase starting in January 2024 and a full implementation phase starting in 2026.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The implementation timeline is provided without revealing a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Importers will need to submit a CBAM report to the European Commission, including information on the quantity of goods and embedded emissions.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article states a requirement without expressing a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Companies need to start defining roles within their businesses and planning for CBAM reporting, as well as understanding their suppliers' carbon footprint.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article advises companies to take proactive steps to prepare for CBAM implementation."}, {"summary": "The implementation phase of CBAM may lead to penalties for missing or incorrect reporting, and importers will need to become registered and authorised declarants.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Non-compliance with CBAM reporting may result in penalties."}, {"summary": "The full implementation phase of CBAM will bring massive changes to importing, and companies should start focusing on it now.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article emphasizes the need for companies to pay attention to CBAM implementation without expressing a positive or negative sentiment."}], "semantic_commentary": "CBAM will create demand for carbon credits in the EU.", "sentiment_score": -0.14285714285714285, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is a policy/system related to removing carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions companies needing to understand their suppliers' carbon footprint and plan for CBAM reporting, indicating a commitment to reducing their carbon footprint."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is related to carbon."}]}, {"source": "Innovation Origins", "link": "https://innovationorigins.com/en/europes-steel-industry-a-push-toward-green-steel/", "title": "Europe\u2019s steel industry: A push toward green steel - IO", "content": "\n\n![Author profile picture](https://innovationorigins.com/app/uploads/2023/01/IO_Team_Laio_Square.jpg)\n\n##### \nBy [Laio](https://innovationorigins.com/en/author/laio/)\n\n\n\n\nEurope\u2019s steel industry is spearheading the transition to low carbon emission steel production. With the introduction of innovative production processes and a range of new environmentally friendly products, the industry is taking significant strides towards sustainability. However, amidst these advancements, the green steel market faces a challenge in terms of standardization. Addressing this issue is among the top priorities on the European Commission\u2019s energy transition agenda. The upcoming implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is also anticipated to have a notable impact on steel imports, influencing their sources and prices.\n\n\n* Europe\u2019s steel industry is transitioning to low carbon production through new processes and environmentally friendly products.\n* The upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to generate over $80 billion in annual revenue by 2040.\n* The EU\u2019s Innovation Fund and state aid rules can support pilot decarbonization projects for clean steel.\n\nThe Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe development of the CBAM is intended to counterbalance carbon leakage, a situation that places countries with stringent carbon emission regulations at a competitive disadvantage due to imports from nations with less rigorous regulations. By imposing a carbon price on certain imported goods based on their carbon footprint, the CBAM seeks to equalise the competition. This mechanism will not only affect the steel industry but will also have implications for other sectors such as cement, aluminium, and fertilisers.\n\n\nThe CBAM has raised some concerns within the steel industry. Notably, fears about a potential increase in steel prices and the necessity for carbon accounting have been voiced. The absence of clear guidelines in the green steel market poses a significant challenge for companies attempting to comply with the CBAM. The lack of standardisation can make it difficult for steel producers to accurately measure and report their emissions, potentially resulting in increased costs or penalties.\n\n\n\n#### Support Us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-time donation\nMonthly\nEach quarter\nAnnually\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail address\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrency\\*AEDAUDBGNCADCHFCZKDKKEUR (\u20ac)GBP (\u00a3)HKDHRKHUFILSISKJPY (\u00a5)NOKNZDPHPPLNRONRUBSEKSGDUSD (US$)ZARAmount (\u20ac) \\*\n \n\n   \n  \n\n\n== Choose a payment method ==iDEALCardPayPal\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nI hereby authorize Media 52 B.V. to collect the amount shown above from my account periodically. \n\n\nI hereby agree to the [Privacy Policy](https://innovationorigins.com/privacy-policy/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal impact and revenue generation\n------------------------------------\n\n\nAccording to S&P Global Trade Atlas data and carbon price outlooks, the implementation of CBAM could generate over $80 billion per year by 2040. This significant revenue generation is expected to persuade other jurisdictions to consider adopting domestic carbon pricing policies to mitigate their long-term exposure. Countries such as Canada, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey are projected to be the leading contributors to CBAM-covered EU trade, accounting for over 40% of total exports to the EU between 2026 and 2040.\n\n\nGiven that the EU accounted for approximately 16% of total global imports in 2021, the impact of the CBAM is expected to be felt worldwide. The coverage of emissions by the EU CBAM certificate price could reach approximately 2.5% of global emissions from products destined for the EU market by 2040. This indicates the potential of the CBAM in driving global carbon pricing and stimulating decarbonisation.\n\n\nDecarbonising the Steel Industry\n--------------------------------\n\n\nThe steel industry is responsible for roughly 5% of CO2 emissions within the EU and 7% globally. For the industry to align with the EU\u2019s climate targets, the development and commercialisation of new low-CO2 technologies within the next decade are necessary. Presently, the EU steel industry is focusing on hydrogen-based steelmaking as a decarbonisation strategy, with several projects across Europe aiming to replace existing steel production processes with hydrogen-based direct reduction of iron.\n\n\n![](https://innovationorigins.com/app/uploads/2023/05/h2-green-steel.png)Swedish H2 Green Steel eliminates climate-damaging carbon by using green hydrogen in the direct reduction process of ironThe green hydrogen will power a new, cycle-oriented steel plant in Boden, northern Sweden. Operations are planned to start at the end of 2025.\nHowever, the production of low-CO2 steel is expected to be more expensive in the short-to-medium term, as costs are dependent on future prices of renewable hydrogen and electricity. Nevertheless, with a significant decrease in the costs of renewable hydrogen and an increase in the price of CO2 emissions, hydrogen-based steelmaking could become competitive with current steelmaking costs by 2050.\n\n\nInvesting in the future\n-----------------------\n\n\nResearch and development (R&D) investment is critical to support the development and deployment of low-CO2 steelmaking technologies. The recently launched Clean Steel Partnership aims to bring breakthrough technologies for clean steel production to large-scale demonstration by 2030, with estimated R&D investment needs up to 2030 amounting to \u20ac2.6 billion.\n\n\nMoreover, the EU\u2019s Innovation Fund, financed by auction revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System, and the carbon contracts for difference under the Innovation Fund will play crucial roles in supporting the demonstration of low-CO2 plants. State aid rules can further boost pilot decarbonisation projects, and given the growing evidence of market willingness to pay a green steel premium, the EU has the opportunity to be a leader in low-CO2 steel production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "summaries": [{"summary": "Europe\u2019s steel industry is transitioning to low carbon production through new processes and environmentally friendly products.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The industry is taking significant strides towards sustainability."}, {"summary": "The upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to generate over $80 billion in annual revenue by 2040.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Significant revenue generation is anticipated, which can persuade other jurisdictions to adopt domestic carbon pricing policies."}, {"summary": "The CBAM will affect the steel industry and other sectors like cement, aluminium, and fertilisers.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The impact of the CBAM is expected to be felt worldwide, but no explicit positive or negative sentiment is specified."}, {"summary": "The absence of clear guidelines in the green steel market poses a challenge for companies trying to comply with the CBAM.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Lack of standardization can result in increased costs or penalties for steel producers."}, {"summary": "The steel industry is responsible for 5% of CO2 emissions within the EU and 7% globally.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The industry has a significant carbon footprint."}, {"summary": "The EU steel industry is focusing on hydrogen-based steelmaking as a decarbonization strategy.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Hydrogen-based steelmaking is seen as a way to reduce carbon emissions."}, {"summary": "The production of low-CO2 steel is expected to be more expensive in the short-to-medium term.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Costs depend on future prices of renewable hydrogen and electricity."}, {"summary": "R&D investment is critical to support the development and deployment of low-CO2 steelmaking technologies.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Investment in research and development is seen as crucial for progress."}, {"summary": "The EU's Innovation Fund and state aid rules can support pilot decarbonization projects for clean steel.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "These initiatives can provide financial support for decarbonization efforts."}], "semantic_commentary": "Relevant article for selling carbon credits to steel industry.", "sentiment_score": 0.2222222222222222, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article discusses the transition of the steel industry to low carbon production processes."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, specifically the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the steel industry's focus on hydrogen-based steelmaking as a decarbonization strategy."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions the steel industry's CO2 emissions."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the production of low-CO2 steel."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article emphasizes the importance of R&D investment to support low-CO2 steelmaking technologies."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the EU's Innovation Fund and state aid rules supporting pilot decarbonization projects for clean steel."}]}, {"source": "Digital Journal", "link": "https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/news/insightace-analytic/carbon-credit-trading-platform-market-know-the-untapped-revenue-growth-opportunities", "title": "Carbon Credit Trading Platform Market \u2013 Know the Untapped Revenue Growth Opportunities", "content": "PRESS RELEASEPublished August 1, 2023[Insightace Analytic](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/news/insightace-analytic/index.html)\n![](https://newsinsightace.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/image-13.png?w=1024)\n\n\n**InsightAce Analytic Pvt.
