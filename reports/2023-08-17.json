Last week, it announced two major \u201ccarbon removal\u201d programs meant to capture carbon and bury it safely underground.\n\n\nThe first program, approved by congressional [appropriations last year](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2022-12-20/html/CREC-2022-12-20-pt1-PgS7819-2.htm), deploys $35 million to \u201cestablish a competitive purchasing pilot program for the purchase of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere or upper hydrosphere.\u201d The second, part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, is a larger $3.5 billion program to develop \u201cdirect air capture\u201d (DAC) facilities across the country. Of that total, the recipients of $1.2 billion were announced, with roughly half going to the oil and gas company Occidental Petroleum and most of the rest going to a partnership of companies including Battelle, Climeworks, and Heirloom.\n\n\nAs the *Financial Times* [explained](https://www.ft.com/content/9aa4a126-707a-41c9-841e-467d969ca766), the aim of this latter program is to kick-start the direct air capture industry: \u201cThe White House hopes the grants will help commercialise the air capture process, driving down costs and spurring a buildout across the country.\u201d\n\n\nWhile [scientists are clear](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SPM.pdf) that we need some level of carbon capture and storage to avoid the worst effects of climate change, it is less clear why the government should pay capitalists \u2014 let alone oil companies \u2014 to do it. Of course, some carbon dioxide can be captured and sold as inputs for a variety of uses (soda production, refrigeration, welding, and so on), but most of it has no market whatsoever. Like much \u201cwaste management,\u201d the disposing of carbon should be a *public service* not a for-profit business.\n\n\nWhile \u201cBidenomics\u201d has so far mostly involved using the fiscal power of the state to shower money on the private sector (and \u201c[de-risk](https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-wall-street-consensus-at-cop27/)\u201d investments), the challenge of carbon removal could be an opportunity to rebuild state capacity and reinstantiate the role of the public sector in making visible investments in socially useful work and environmental restoration.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo We Even Need Carbon Capture?\n===============================\n\n\nThere are few topics more controversial on the climate left than carbon capture and storage (CCS), a [variety of technologies](https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/catalyst-with-shayle-kann/taking-a-closer-look-at-carbon-capture) aimed at capturing carbon dioxide and storing it (usually in geological depositories). Most climate justice organizations fiercely [oppose](https://climatejusticealliance.org/cj-leaders-denounce-ccs-at-whejac/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) the technology as, at best, an unproven \u201cfalse solution\u201d or, at worst, a cynical ploy by the fossil fuel industry to justify continued operations for decades to come.\n\n\nThe problem with environmentalist opposition to carbon capture is that climate scientists agree we probably [need a lot of it](https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-dioxide-removal-industry-biden) to avoid a catastrophic level of warming above 2 degrees Celsius. That is because of two material realities. First, we\u2019ve emitted so much carbon already that even if we stopped emissions tomorrow, we would still need to deal with the already massive amount of carbon in the atmosphere.\n\n\nSecond, there are some forms of emissions \u2014 scientists call them \u201c[residual emissions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01592-2)\u201d \u2014 for which there are no clear technological pathways to mitigation. For example, making cement creates a byproduct of carbon dioxide (the industry itself is estimated to be responsible for around [7-8 percent](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/greening-cement-production-has-big-role-play-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions) of global emissions), and applying nitrogen fertilizer to soil creates greenhouse gas emissions. Assuming we want to live in a society with cement and fertilizer, we need either to find a way to capture the emissions at the source or to compensate for them with direct air capture.\n\n\nIn fact, you could say the Biden administration\u2019s plans for carbon removal are woefully insufficient compared to what is required. James Temple [points out](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/11/1077756/the-us-just-invested-more-than-1-billion-into-carbon-removal/):\n\n\n\n> By some estimates, nations may have to collectively pull down some 10 billion tons a year by midcentury to have a good shot at keeping the planet from warming beyond 2\u00b0C. . . . It would take 10,000 DAC hubs with the capacity of the ones funded on Friday to reach it.\n> \n> \n\n\nA political bonus of accepting the scientific necessity of carbon capture is that labor unions [strongly support](https://www.axios.com/2021/08/03/climate-unions-congress-carbon-capture-funding) scaling up the technology as a means to maintain and expand industrial jobs with historically high levels of unionization (e.g., pipeline construction for CO2 and power plants with CCS).\n\n\nThe Left is [currently split](https://catalyst-journal.com/2023/03/socialist-politics-and-the-electricity-grid) between environmental organizations who typically advocate a narrow technical vision of decarbonization (solar, wind, and batteries) and unions who see their interests in a much broader suite of technologies (including [carbon capture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040619021000920) but also [nuclear power](http://www.ibew.org/media-center/Articles/21Daily/2109/210901_ANS_IBEW_OpEd)). You would think it would be obvious for socialists to [align with labor](https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/no-15-winter-2022/unions-labor-green-new-deal), but the ideological pull of a [small-scale, decentralized](https://jacobin.com/2022/04/new-deal-tennessee-valley-authority-electricity-public-utilities-renewables-green-power) energy system looms large on the climate left today.\n\n\nToo much of the climate debate is wrapped up in a moralistic classification scheme wherein some technologies (solar panels and wind farms) are regarded as unequivocally good and others, like carbon capture, are considered totally bad. As Holly Jean Buck [recently argued](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-carbon-capture-distraction/), the climate left is wasting too much energy opposing something that capitalist industry has been reluctant to invest in in the first place; it turns out it\u2019s not particularly profitable to spend money capturing something that has no mass market. Moving forward, Buck says, \u201cthe climate left needs to move beyond the question of which technologies are good or bad and focus instead on how we implement them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, by giving over half a billion dollars to Occidental Petroleum, the Biden administration will only intensify environmentalist opposition to the broad idea of CCS. This is a company whose CEO Vicki Hollub [explained](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/08/oil-industry-shift-climate-tech-00085853) in March that carbon capture \u201cgives our industry a license to continue to operate for the 60, 70, 80 years that I think it\u2019s going to be very much needed.\u201d In fact, Occidental has been most known for using carbon dioxide in \u201cenhanced oil recovery\u201d \u2014 that is, injecting captured carbon underground to help push up still more oil to be burned. This is hardly a climate strategy.\n\n\nThat both newly announced DAC hubs will be located in oil and gas country \u2014 Texas and Louisiana \u2014 will only bolster environmentalists\u2019 cynical view that carbon capture is simply a fossil capitalist con.\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Removal Is a Public Good\n===============================\n\n\nThe administration could have approached this very differently. You could say the climate crisis is at its core a *public crisis*: it is a crisis of the shared atmospheric commons. As ecological Marxist James O\u2019Connor [argued](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10455758809358356) over thirty years ago, capitalists have a structural tendency to undermine the ecological conditions of production.\n\n\nRather than trusting these same capitalists to clean up after themselves, Christian Parenti [rightly argues](https://www.academia.edu/50049776/A_left_defense_of_carbon_dioxide_removal) we should empower the state to build infrastructures of carbon removal as a public utility. While late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century cities confronted the public crisis of water contamination with what some called \u201c[sewer socialism](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS428),\u201d we need to approach the climate crisis in a similar fashion.\n\n\nThe decidedly nonsocialist climate-modeling researchers at the Rhodium Group [recently proposed](https://rhg.com/research/capturing-leadership-policies-for-the-us-to-advance-direct-air-capture-technology/) the US federal government set up something called the Carbon Removal Administration (CRA). The CRA could be modeled on its New Deal forebears \u2014 the Civil Works Administration, the Public Works Administration, the Works Progress Administration, and so on \u2014 which all made *highly visible* [public investments](https://livingnewdeal.org/) in infrastructure all over the country, and, in so doing, helped build a [political majority](https://jacobin.com/2019/09/bernie-sanders-new-deal-speech-socialism-roosevelt-race-housing-fdr) that lasted generations.\n\n\nThere is one slight problem. When it comes to direct air capture, Robinson Meyer [explains](https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-dioxide-removal-industry-biden), \u201cmost [decarbonization] expertise resides in the private sector.\u201d Under capitalism, private capitalists own and control the means of production \u2014 and for the time being that includes the means of producing machines that suck carbon from the air.\n\n\nBut instead of paying capital to run the machines, the public sector could simply purchase them and run them itself under the CRA mantle. More radically, the state could expropriate DAC technology altogether, given that the \u201cexpertise\u201d is mainly housed in in the same oil and gas industry that is expropriating our atmospheric future.\n\n\nIt is [projected](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/11/1077756/the-us-just-invested-more-than-1-billion-into-carbon-removal/) that the two DAC hubs the Biden administration is funding will create a total of forty-eight hundred jobs. Imagine if those jobs were under the banner of the CRA and framed in terms of \u201cpublic works\u201d rather than private profit. These CRA DAC hubs could also hire oil and gas workers to do what Buck calls \u201c[reverse engineering](https://www.versobooks.com/products/2735-ending-fossil-fuels)\u201d \u2014 we\u2019ve spent roughly two hundred years sucking vast amounts of carbon from underground, and it will take roughly the same skill set and workforce to inject in back underneath. These workers and communities would be enrolled in a wider political project, a real \u201c[just transition](https://jacobin.com/2020/10/oil-gas-workers-just-transition-green-new-deal),\u201d where the government is seen as serving the public good through carbon removal.\n\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing neoliberal capitalism has accomplished, it is the evisceration of the very notion of the public good. If neoliberalism is really \u201c[over](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02632764211036722)\u201d (a [debatable](https://jacobin.com/2022/04/end-of-neoliberalism-think-tanks-lobby-groups) idea), we better have a new vision of public solidarity to replace it.\n\n\nBut, for the most part, [Bidenomics](https://jacobin.com/2023/07/joe-biden-supply-side-liberalism-industrial-policy) has meant injecting cash into capitalist firms rather than rebuilding state capacity. Consequently, those firms carry on their operations with no visible indicator to the public that these \u201cinvestments\u201d are part of a larger *political* program of climate action. For those residing in Texas, it\u2019s simply a continuation of an economic model by and for the Occidental Petroleums of the world.\n\n\n\n\nThe Green New Deal Is Still a Good Idea We Haven\u2019t Really Tried\n===============================================================\n\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s climate investments have created enthusiastic excitement among [policy wonks](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3781) and the [business press](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2023-02-04), they are having next to no impact on the wider public. Kate Aronoff [explains](https://newrepublic.com/article/174860/public-doesnt-know-well-inflation-reduction-act-working), \u201cA *Washington Post*\u2013University of Maryland [poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2023/08/04/july-13-23-2023-washington-post-university-maryland-climate-poll/) conducted in mid-July found that 57 percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of climate change; 71 percent heard \u2018a little\u2019 or \u2018nothing at all\u2019 about the IRA.\u201d\n\n\nThis is bad news for 2024 (especially since the Right is already planning a [frontal assault](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/climate/republicans-climate-project2025.html) on Biden\u2019s already modest climate program). The original idea for a [Green New Deal](https://www.versobooks.com/products/2546-a-planet-to-win) was to empower the public sector to build the necessary infrastructure and waste management systems to deal with the crisis and expand the welfare state to reverse decades of austerity and attacks on working-class life.\n\n\nThe idea was that only this vast public intervention could create the kind of political majorities needed to sustain long term decarbonization. Bidenomics \u2014 while certainly an improvement over whatever you\u2019d call Barack Obama\u2019s economic program \u2014 seems destined to continue the Democratic Party\u2019s long-standing tradition of being [51 percent losers](https://jacobin.com/2018/11/midterm-elections-reconstruction-du-bois) and the seesaw patterns of partisan gridlock and power swaps between parties.

That law, called the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, funnels hundreds of billions of dollars into clean-energy tax credits for power producers, rebates for electric vehicles and heat pumps, and other emissions-fighting measures. After decades of inaction on climate change, the IRA marked a new era in the nation\u2019s belated quest to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\nBut the fight over the law isn\u2019t over yet. Recent polling shows that a whopping [7 in 10 Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/07/biden-white-house-climate-policy/) say they haven\u2019t heard anything substantial about the IRA, an apparent indication that most voters aren\u2019t thinking about it as the 2024 presidential election approaches. Furthermore, even though most new investment from the bill [has flowed to red states](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/13/biden-inflation-reduction-act-climate-states-00110940), many Republican leaders are [pushing back against it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-11/desantis-says-no-thanks-to-377-million-in-federal-energy-funds?sref=wINQCNXe).\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s also far from guaranteed that the law will work as planned. The bill consists of more than a hundred different provisions, many of them involving complicated changes to the tax code, and some of those provisions are already hitting snags. Even if everything goes exactly right, experts believe the bill will [still leave the U.S. short of President Biden\u2019s stated climate goals](https://grist.org/politics/one-year-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-is-working-kind-of/). In all likelihood, the U.S. will need to pass more climate legislation to achieve those goals. The public\u2019s appetite for that will hinge on the success of the IRA.\u00a0\n\n\nThe man tasked with ensuring the bill\u2019s success is John Podesta, a veteran political strategist who served as a senior White House official under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama but became something close to a household name only after then-presidential candidate [Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were leaked](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-wikileaks.html). Podesta is fond of saying that he \u201cfailed at retirement\u201d \u2014 he thought he was done with politics for good when Biden tapped him to shepherd the rollout of his landmark legislative achievement.\n\n\n\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

You\u2019re in charge of implementing the IRA. A lot of our readers might want to know: What do you do all day?**\n\n\n\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

[Here's How](https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist)\n\n\n\n\n**A.** Look, this is a multifaceted bill. There\u2019s 135 separate programs in the bill. A good deal of the work is being done through the tax code. So I spent a lot of time working with the Department of Treasury, the Department of Energy, and other related agencies \u2014 like the Labor Department on some of the provisions \u2014 just trying to get guidance out so that the private sector has clarity about how it can take advantage of the support for clean energy and clean technology that\u2019s in the bill.\n\n\nOne of the interesting elements of the bill was: it\u2019s just not a power-sector-only bill. It attacks all the emitting sectors: power, transportation, buildings, forestry and agriculture, as well as manufacturing and infrastructure. So given the sweep of that, there\u2019s a lot of detail that needs to be worked out. And in addition to talking to a lot of companies who are trying to plan for the future and raising issues about how to interpret various provisions of the bill, I spent a lot of time talking to my colleagues in other federal agencies to make sure that we get clarity. And then there\u2019s $100 billion worth of grants that we\u2019re working to move quickly and expeditiously. The money is available for some period of time, but we want to get it moving upfront because the need is so great.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q. A recent [Washington Post poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/07/biden-white-house-climate-policy/) found that 7 in 10 Americans don\u2019t know very much about the IRA at all. What does it tell you about the bill? Are there efforts underway to mitigate that?**\n\n\n**A.** It\u2019s really natural in today\u2019s political environment that people don\u2019t pay attention to legislation, particularly when you\u2019re talking about specific legislative names. They don\u2019t really relate to it on that basis. But they do relate to projects, jobs, companies coming into their communities, and I think the general level of public support remains high across the political spectrum.\u00a0\n\n\nI\u2019m a veteran of the Affordable Care Act, and the difference between the ACA and the clean energy investments in the IRA is that the Affordable Care Act, by the time it actually passed, was kind of unpopular. It took a while for people to feel the benefits of it. Now, notwithstanding Republican efforts, they can\u2019t tear it away, because people are really seeing its benefits. I think the same thing will be true of the Inflation Reduction Act. Whether people relate to the name of the bill or not, you know, that\u2019s for others to judge.\n\n\n**Q.** **You mention there\u2019s a lot of corporate investment happening right now, like big manufacturing investments in electric vehicles, and it\u2019s true that Americans will notice if there\u2019s a new factory in their town. But the consumer-facing side of the bill does rely on people knowing they can claim a tax credit for a home retrofit or a heat pump. Are you concerned that the lack of awareness is going to hinder the uptake of those consumer credits?**\n\n\n**A.** I think we\u2019re working hard to make sure it doesn\u2019t, and we need consumer-facing businesses to help people know what they can take advantage of. The Department of Energy, for instance, has made a series of grants to upgrade the training of people who are in the HVAC business, so that they know the benefits that are available to consumers. You mention heat pumps \u2014 generally those are point-of-failure purchases, so you\u2019ve got to know about the availability. It\u2019s a little easier on the auto side, because the auto companies are all over this movement toward electrification: They\u2019re advertising heavily on it, they\u2019ve committed very substantial capital to it. It\u2019s important for us, as the government, to be out there talking about the benefits, but some of this is neighbor to neighbor.\n\n\n**Q. Four Republican states have said that they won\u2019t take IRA money, even though most of the benefits of this bill are actually going to red states. Does that hold up the implementation? How much does that make your job harder?**\u00a0\n\n\n**A.** I mean, it\u2019s an unusual decision to refuse to support at a time when virtually every part of the country is feeling some kind of extreme weather. You don\u2019t have to go to the deadliest fire in the last hundred years of American history, in Maui. It was over 110 degrees for 31 straight days in Phoenix. The floods in upstate New York, in Vermont, and the extreme heat in the south and the Southeast. So, you know, putting your head in the sand and ignoring the reality, and ignoring the science, and ignoring everybody\u2019s lived experience to make a statement that everything has to be a culture war issue, is sort of unusual.\n\n\nFour [states] turned down the planning money, but 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico took it. So I feel like we\u2019re moving forward. I spend time talking to Republican governors, and unlike their counterparts in the House of Representatives, they\u2019re anxious to attract the investment. I saw Governor [Kevin] Stitt from Oklahoma, and he just landed a big solar plant in Oklahoma. And all he wanted to talk about is why the Volkswagen Battery plant got away from him and what more he could do to attract more clean investment.\n\n\n**Q.** **You\u2019re drawing a distinction between Republican governors, who obviously want to land these investments, and the House GOP \u2014 many members of which have said that they want to repeal the IRA. What happens if come 2025, the credits are rescinded or limited? How damaging do you think that would be for the decarbonization process in the U.S.?**\n\n\n**A.** This is the most significant piece of our ability to hit the pledge that President Biden made in 2021 to cut our greenhouse gas emissions between 50 and 52 percent by 2030. Around 40 to 42 percent of that is a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, and that depends on tax credits being available through the rest of this decade. House Republicans have tried on several occasions to repeal large parts of it, but I think the more people see and feel the benefits, the harder and harder that will be. These companies are investing [in renewable energy] because the structure of this law gives them certainty. Rather than the on-off, on-off [structure] of previous renewable credits, they have ten years of certainty. I think those investments will prove to be durable, and I don\u2019t know that Republicans, even if they had more power, would walk away from that.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q.** **A lot of the investments that you\u2019re talking about so far have gone to red states. In particular, a lot have gone to right-to-work states and states with lower prevailing wages. Is that outcome problematic for an administration that has prioritized union jobs?**\n\n\n**A.** Because [the legislation is] built into the tax code, companies are going to make individual choices. I think what we expect from them is to give everywhere a fair shot, and we want to push them towards labor neutrality. We saw a bit of success in the Blue Bird [electric school bus factory] [being organized in Georgia](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/26/23738451/blue-bird-electric-yellow-school-bus-factory-georgia). There\u2019ll be places where people want to take advantage of whatever state is offering tax breaks or lower personnel costs. But I think for the most part, we\u2019re seeing investment all over. And obviously our voice is critical, and we\u2019re trying to make sure that it\u2019s loud and in support of the right to organize.\n\n\n**Q.** **We have to ask you about [permitting reform](https://grist.org/climate-energy/transmission-impossible-are-democrats-punting-on-permitting-reform/), just because it seems like so much of this really hinges on that. Recent negotiations around permitting reform have sputtered out, and permitting reform has become one of those things that keeps coming back and keeps dying. Is that absolutely essential to the longevity of the IRA?**\n\n\n**A.** Cutting the time to permit and fixing the interconnection queue problems is absolutely essential. It would be great if we get some legislative support for that. But I think we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure these projects are indeed considered and permitted, and that any real concerns \u2014 whether those are environmental justice or environmental concerns \u2014 are considered early at the front end so that we can mitigate those concerns and move projects forward.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is my third White House, and my fourth presidential administration, and we\u2019re doing something I\u2019ve never seen before, which is Cabinet-level, White House-coordinated attention to permitting at a policy level and at an individual project level. We meet regularly at a Cabinet level to try to consider both: Are there things we can do to cut time and ensure quality in the permitting process at a policy level? And then going directly to the individual projects and saying: Why are they hung up? Can we find a way to fix that?\n\n\nI think when you have political accountability, starting from the [resident, saying, \u201cI want this done,\u201d things will happen. And I think they are happening. But could we use a lot from our friends on Capitol Hill? Yes, we could.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q.** **I\u2019m sure you know that local governments, especially in the Midwest, are putting up pretty significant opposition to the siting of wind and solar facilities. There\u2019s one report that [found 228 new laws in 35 states](https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/opposition-renewable-energy-facilities-united-states-may-2023-edition) that make it more difficult to build these projects. To what extent do you think the local opposition represents a challenge to the rollout of the IRA? And can you even do anything about that at the federal level to make it easier to site these facilities?**\n\n\n**A.** I think that we have a role in establishing the benefits of clean power: the economic benefits, the health benefits. But I think at the end of the day, some of those decisions are localized. There\u2019s a significant amount of money being spent to slow the buildout, that\u2019s coming from a variety of sources and people who oppose taking action to deal with climate change. We can\u2019t directly get involved, but we can encourage other voices to be involved in those local fights. This is going to be a little bit of hand-to-hand combat in the near term. People [from local political organizations] will come to us and say, \u201ccan\u2019t you make [decarbonization] go faster?\u201d And I think it\u2019s a fair point for us to say, \u201cYou know, you have local members. What are you doing about this?\u201d\n\n\n**Q.** **There\u2019s been a lot of debate over a lot of the provisions in the bill, including [green hydrogen](https://grist.org/energy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-ira/), [carbon capture](https://grist.org/technology/will-the-inflation-reduction-act-jumpstart-carbon-capture-45q/), and [biogas](https://grist.org/agriculture/biogas-boom-ira-incentives/), with many environmental justice advocates raising concerns about them. I just wonder how you think about balancing a strong momentum for decarbonization with the concerns of the communities that are going to be near this infrastructure.**\n\n\n**A.** In our view, it\u2019s going to be essential that we find a pathway for truly green hydrogen, because it\u2019s going to be a very important element of decarbonizing the industrial sector. It\u2019s also critical in terms of both air and marine fuels. But I think we also have to listen to the communities that are voicing concerns about it. There\u2019s also going to have to be a significant amount of carbon removal in order to hit the net-zero goals by mid-century, and some of that\u2019s going to happen by direct removal of carbon from the atmosphere. I think that it\u2019s incumbent in this decade that we begin to create strong environmental protections for the technologies that are going to be required if we\u2019re going to stabilize the atmosphere. We\u2019re trying our best to make sure we\u2019re listening to people and that we make good decisions.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q.** **A lot of the consumer-focused energy efficiency programs, plus the heat pumps and solar panels, require pretty significant upfront investment. Are you concerned that the takeup will lag behind in low-income communities? Even though you get a tax credit, it\u2019s still going to be out of reach for a lot of people.**\n\n\n**A.** We\u2019re trying to solve for that, particularly on the rebate side. If you\u2019re a low-income household you can switch out to a heat pump for a very, very low cost \u2014 in some cases free \u2014 but that has to be done at the point of sale, and we need to work with states to implement the credits so that there isn\u2019t a big upfront capital expenditure. It\u2019s a little bit different in terms of taking advantage of the tax rebate advantages, where you get that money back on your tax return, but we\u2019re trying as much as we can to make that consumer-friendly, including working with the auto companies and dealers.\n\n\n**Q.** **It sounds like you\u2019re kind of saying that, in addition to state and local governments, you guys need help from like, Lowe\u2019s, or something, to make this bill work.**\n\n\n**A.** I think that\u2019s where people get a lot of their information from, particularly in the home retrofitting area, as it relates to insulation for windows and doors and induction stoves. Those credits are generous, but people have to know about them. And so we\u2019re trying to work with individuals in the install community and with home improvement people to do that.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q. On the home improvement front, have you personally benefited from any of the provisions in the IRA?**\n\n\n**A.** Well, I could have, but I did it earlier. I was an early adopter of solar.

Making new things is an obvious answer, though it\u2019s still an expensive proposition. Stashing it underground is another, cheaper option; it usually involves compressing and injecting the gas into underground rock formations, kind of like oil drilling in reverse.\n\nBut when it comes to storing carbon underground, there\u2019s another choice that\u2019s even more straightforward: agricultural soils. Farming and ranching [has the potential to store](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SPM.pdf) from 2 billion to 4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide every year for between $45 and $100 per metric ton, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As carbon-removal schemes go, that\u2019s pretty cheap.\n\n\u201cSoil science, for the last 20 years, has been banging their drum to say there\u2019s an enormous opportunity here,\u201d [Yard Stick](https://www.useyardstick.com/) CEO Chris Tolles told TechCrunch+.\n\nBut how much carbon is held by soils \u2014 and how much they capture over time \u2014 is not an easy thing to measure. Most soil sampling is done by hand-digging cores out of the ground and sending the samples to a lab. It\u2019s labor- and time-intensive, which means it\u2019s not cheap.\n\nAs a soil scientist, Yard Stick scientific adviser and research collaborator Cristine Morgan was intimately familiar with it all. For years, she researched how to use probes to characterize soils, reducing the entire process down to one step. By the time Tolles contacted her, the technology was pretty well developed. In the fall of 2020, she, Tolles and chief engineerKevin Meissner founded Yard Stick to commercialize it.\n\nIt works something like this: The probe part sits near the tip of what\u2019s essentially a foot-and-a-half-long drill bit. It uses spectroscopy to determine how much carbon is locked in the soil. That basically means it shines a light on the soil through a sapphire lens and measures what gets reflected. The device samples hundreds of spectral bands, from visible violet light all the way up to near-infrared. The smarts of the unit sit in a case atop the drill bit; it\u2019s a little bit bigger than a rugby ball. The whole thing is then attached to an off-the-shelf cordless drill, and a sample takes less than a minute to complete.\n\nTolles said this version is just the first of many, a proof of concept that will be further refined. Next year, the company plans to build a version that can be attached to the back of a truck, allowing the operator to drive up to a sample site, press a button, and let the rig do the rest of the work.\n\nThe different versions will help the company characterize soils in a range of different environments, but for now, Yard Stick is focusing on farms and ranches.\n\nThe startup recently closed a $10.6 million Series A round, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned. The round was led by Toyota Ventures with participation from the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, the Nature Conservancy, Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Pillar VC.\n\n\n\nMore TechCrunch\n\n\n\n\n[![](https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/87e706cecfac192250125b9f29df213d7f244398.jpg?64dd2afa)\n\n### The startup landscape has shifted dramatically: Accelerators must adapt or fade away](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/the-startup-landscape-has-shifted-dramatically-accelerators-must-adapt-or-fade-away/ \"The startup landscape has shifted dramatically: Accelerators must adapt or fade away\")\n[![](https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/b52c79891dd79a41b951ad34390f97d3dc21f720.jpg?649c8ac1)\n\n### How Greenlyte is going from zero to 1,000 metric tons of captured CO2 in a year](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/greenlyte-carbon-capture-fundraise/ \"How Greenlyte is going from zero to 1,000 metric tons of captured CO2 in a year\")\n[![](https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/4f70516c2a61b6efcce33c2aa2c9d61d347edf4f.jpg?64dd363e)\n\n### As unicorns grow rarer, maybe it's time to look toward revenue, not valuations](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/16/it-shouldve-been-centaurs-all-along/ \"As unicorns grow rarer, maybe it's time to look toward revenue, not valuations\")\n[![](https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/b12bdac94e42ee4ce8bd41152b6d0fc7063c00f0.jpg?64dcff00)\n\n### The tech jobs market is as strong as it ever was](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/tech-jobs-market-h1-2023/ \"The tech jobs market is as strong as it ever was\")\n\n\n### Sign up for Newsletters\n\n[See all newsletters(opens in a new window)](https://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters)\n\nDailyWeek in ReviewStartups WeeklyEvent UpdatesAdvertising UpdatesTechCrunch+ AnnouncementsTechCrunch+ EventsTechCrunch+ RoundupEmailSubscribe[twitter(opens in a new window)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25&text=Soil%20can%20store%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%2C%20and%20Yard%20Stick%20wants%20to%20measure%20it%20all&via=techcrunch)[facebook(opens in a new window)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25)[linkedin(opens in a new window)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25&title=Soil%20can%20store%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%2C%20and%20Yard%20Stick%20wants%20to%20measure%20it%20all&summary=Agriculture%20could%20store%202%20billion%20to%204%20billion%20metric%20tons%20of%20CO2%20annually%2C%20but%20first%20we%20have%20to%20know%20which%20farms%20have%20the%20most%20potential.%0A&source=TechCrunch)[reddit(opens in a new window)](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25&title=Soil%20can%20store%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%2C%20and%20Yard%20Stick%20wants%20to%20measure%20it%20all)[mail(opens in a new window)](mailto:?subject=Soil%20can%20store%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%2C%20and%20Yard%20Stick%20wants%20to%20measure%20it%20all&body=Article:%20https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25)Copy Share LinkcheckmarkCopy### Tags\n\n* [EC Food Climate and Sustainability](/tag/ec-food-climate-and-sustainability/)\n* [soil carbon](/tag/soil-carbon/)\n* [Yard Stick](/tag/yard-stick/)\n[TechCrunch](/)plus-bold[Fundraising](/techcrunchplus/fundraising/)[Soil can store gigatons of carbon, and Yard Stick wants to measure it all](/2023/08/17/yard-stick-measure-soil-carbon/)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Tim De Chant](/author/tim-de-chant/)1:00 AM GMT+12\u2022August 18, 2023Agriculture could store 2 billion to 4 billion metric tons of CO2 annually, but first we have to know which farms have the most potential.\n![Scientist samples soil using a portable spectroscope from Yard Stick](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/YardStick-241-1.jpg?w=430&h=230&crop=1)[Transportation](/category/transportation/)[Ford aims to secure battery material supply with new Canada facility](/2023/08/17/ford-aims-to-secure-battery-material-supply-with-new-canada-facility/)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Rebecca Bellan](/author/rebecca-bellan/)5:12 AM GMT+12\u2022August 18, 2023Ford is partnering with South Korean battery manufacturers SK On and EcoPro BM to build a cathode manufacturing facility in Quebec, Canada.

As a climate reporter, I\u2019m firmly in the camp of people who think about climate change all the time\u2014but not everyone does. And if you haven\u2019t heard of this law, you\u2019re not alone. According to a new poll, [71% of people in the US have heard little or nothing about the Inflation Reduction Act.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/07/biden-white-house-climate-policy/) In case you fall into this group, let me hit the high points for you:\n\n * It\u2019s often referred to as the IRA for short\n* Signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022 (a year ago today!)\n* Included an estimated $369 billion in funding for climate change\n* Made up of grants, loans, and a whole lot of tax credits\n\n That\u2019s a metric boatload of money, and people in climate have been speculating about what it will all mean ever since we got the first version of the bill more than 365 days ago.\u00a0\n\n \nI just [published a story](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/16/1078014/ira-funding-one-year-climate-technology/) about where things stand with US climate tech policy after one year of the IRA. [Check it out](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/16/1078014/ira-funding-one-year-climate-technology/), and for the newsletter this week **let\u2019s consider what\u2019s changed and what\u2019s next for the breakthrough climate law.**\n\n ### **Manufacturing**\n\n **Then:** My colleague James Temple and I [wrote about the Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/28/1056531/technology-wins-breakthrough-climate-bill/), which was then still a bill, as soon as the draft text was released in late July 2022. It was clear at the time that this would be a very big deal for US climate action:\u00a0\n\n \n*Ryan Fitzpatrick, director of the climate and energy program at Third Way, said it\u2019s an ambitious and politically pragmatic bill designed to boost US manufacturing, provide support where job sectors are shifting, and build out the infrastructure needed to shift to cleaner, modern energy systems.*\n\n *\u201cThis would be the largest investment of its kind in American history,\u201d he said.*\n\n Related Story\n-------------\n\n[How a half-trillion dollars is transforming climate technology](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/16/1078014/ira-funding-one-year-climate-technology/)Checking in with the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, one year later.\n\n\n **Now:** While a lot of the funding still hasn\u2019t made it out the door yet, there are early signs that this boost in US manufacturing is well underway. There\u2019s a constant flurry of companies citing the IRA while announcing massive investments in new manufacturing facilities in the US for clean technologies.\u00a0\n\n Take First Solar, the largest US solar panel manufacturer. Just two weeks after the IRA became law last year, the company [pledged to expand its factory operations in the US](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/first-solar-pledges-big-us-factory-expansion-thanks-climate-law-2022-08-30/) and build a $1.2 billion factory in the Southeast, directly citing the climate law in its announcement. A few weeks ago, the company made [another announcement about plans to scale even further](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/first-solar-plans-11-bln-investment-fifth-us-panel-factory-2023-07-27/) and build yet another billion-dollar factory.\u00a0\n\n  In total, companies have announced over [$76 billion in private investments](https://www.jackconness.com/ira-chips-investments) in climate technology manufacturing since the IRA was signed into law.\u00a0\n\n ### **Electric vehicles**\n\n **Then**: There were early concerns that [restrictions in the EV tax credits](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/02/1056606/ev-tax-credits-battery-supply/) could limit how many vehicles would wind up qualifying for them, limiting their effectiveness.\u00a0\n\n The rules lay out that consumers would only get the full $7,500 credit for a new EV if the vehicle is made from materials and batteries from the US (or free trade agreement partners). The rules attached to the credits were aimed at boosting US production of battery minerals, components, and cells. At the time, it wasn\u2019t totally clear exactly how everything would get interpreted, and just how restrictive these would wind up being.\u00a0\n\n **Now:** We\u2019ve gotten some clarity on most of the EV tax credits, and it seems like the agency has largely erred on the side of allowing more vehicles to qualify. But even today, there are looming questions on this major program.\u00a0\n\n \n\nNamely, there\u2019s a bit that excludes EVs that have a \u201cforeign entity of concern\u201d involved in their supply chain starting in 2024. That term hasn\u2019t really been defined yet\u2014though there\u2019s a chance that China, which dominates several parts of the EV supply chain, will fall into that category. \n\n Check out [my story on the EV credits from last year](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/02/1056606/ev-tax-credits-battery-supply/) for more on what that could mean for battery prices and EV ownership. I\u2019d also recommend looking back at a newsletter from my colleague Zeyi Yang about how [EV batteries could be the next point of tension between the US and China.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/22/1069032/ev-batteries-politicization-china-us/)\n\n ### **Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\n **Then: The number I heard over and over last year was 40%\u2014experts said that the IRA would cut US emissions by 40% from 2005 levels by 2030.** It was more than what the country was on track for (around a 30% to 35% cut) but less than what the country needs to do to meet international targets (a 50% reduction).\u00a0\n\n Thinking about how modeling experts go from hundreds of billions of dollars to an expected emissions cut broke my brain a little, so I dove into the weeds and spoke with several of them for a story last August about how [predicting the results of economic policies like the IRA is tricky](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/12/1057675/predicting-climate-bill-effects/).\u00a0\n\n Related Story\n-------------\n\n[Predicting the climate bill\u2019s effects is harder than you might think](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/12/1057675/predicting-climate-bill-effects/)Tax credits will drive emissions cuts, but how much and how fast isn\u2019t as clear as models might suggest.\n\n\n At the time they said that we can assume that lower prices means more uptake of products like EVs and solar panels, and we know how much those products cut emissions. But they also pointed out that there are still a lot of complicating factors. People don\u2019t always behave rationally, for example. It can also be hard to tease out how much policies push people to adopt new products that are already getting pretty cheap on their own. That all means we should probably take these predictions with a bit of caution.\u00a0\n\n **Now:** The emissions effects from the IRA\u2019s policies are still mostly projections. We won\u2019t know for a while exactly how well all this money translates into climate action. But early signs in manufacturing and EV uptake are very positive.\u00a0\n\n For even more on how well the IRA might work, and what\u2019s coming next for the breakthrough legislation, [check out my story from earlier today on the legislation\u2019s first anniversary.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/16/1078014/ira-funding-one-year-climate-technology/)\n\n ### **Related reading**\n\n For more on what\u2019s in the IRA and what experts thought at the time, check out our [initial coverage from last summer](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/28/1056531/technology-wins-breakthrough-climate-bill/), as well as my follow-up stories on the [EV tax credits](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/02/1056606/ev-tax-credits-battery-supply/) and how emissions modelers worked to figure out [what the money would mean for climate progress.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/12/1057675/predicting-climate-bill-effects/)\u00a0\n\n \n[This opinion piece from Jonas Nahm](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/21/1063525/the-us-climate-bill-emission-dependent-economic-success/) (now a senior economist for the Biden administration\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers), published last November, lays out how the IRA ties climate action with economic success.\u00a0\n\n My colleague James Temple [took on the topic of carbon capture subsidies in the IRA.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/25/1058591/why-the-carbon-capture-subsidies-in-the-climate-bill-are-good-news-for-emissions/) There was ([and is](https://twitter.com/jtemple/status/1691572872328941851?s=20)) concern that investing in carbon capture could extend the life of fossil fuel plants. But James points out that the subsidies could be crucial in hard-to-decarbonize sectors like steel and cement.\u00a0\n\n \n### **Another thing**\n\n **The US just invested over $1 billion in carbon removal**. The funding is mostly going to two direct air capture hubs\u2014one in Texas and the other in Louisiana.\u00a0\n\n By some estimates, we may need to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year to stay below 2 \u00b0C of global warming. That\u2019s a daunting figure, one that could require trillions of dollars to pull off. For more on this funding and how carbon removal fits into climate goals, [jump into this new story from James Temple.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/11/1077756/the-us-just-invested-more-than-1-billion-into-carbon-removal/)\u00a0\n\n  ### **Keeping up with climate**\n\n **Last week, wildfires tore through the island of Maui in Hawaii, killing** [**over 100 people**](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/15/us/hawaii-maui-wildfires) **and burning hundreds of acres**.

Clean hydrogen can be produced from zero-emissions electricity generated by wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear, as well as from conversion of leak-tight natural gas and sustainably sourced biomass with carbon capture and storage. However, currently more than 95% of the roughly 10 million metric tons of hydrogen produced in the United States comes from natural gas without the capture and geologic storage of carbon dioxide, which results in significant emissions. This is why advancing clean hydrogen production is important to help address climate change.\n\n\nDOE\u2019s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), under the purview of DOE\u2019s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), will manage the selected projects. Projects will focus on:\n\n\n* Developing technologies that could help produce clean hydrogen at lower cost and with less energy;\n* Exploring ways to produce hydrogen using biomass, effluent waters from oil and natural gas development and production, and other wastes; and\n* Expanding options for safe and efficient hydrogen transport and storage across the nation.\n\nA detailed list of the selected projects can be found [here](/fecm/additional-selections-funding-opportunity-announcement-2400-clean-hydrogen-production-0).\n\n\nWith the selections announced today, FECM has announced investments of more than $122 million in 72 projects since January 2021 to explore new, clean methods to produce hydrogen and to improve the performance of hydrogen-fueled turbines. These projects support [DOE\u2019s Hydrogen Shot initiative](/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-shot), which seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in one decade to grow new, clean hydrogen pathways in the United States.\n\n\nAs outlined in the [U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/us-national-clean-hydrogen-strategy-roadmap.pdf), achieving commercial-scale hydrogen deployment is critical to building a strong clean energy economy in the United States, while enabling our long-term decarbonization objectives. Estimates indicate that America\u2019s growing hydrogen economy has the potential to add 100,000 net new direct and indirect jobs by 2030.\n\n\nFECM minimizes environmental and climate impacts of fossil fuels and industrial processes while working to achieve net-zero emissions across our economy. Priority areas of technology work include carbon capture, carbon conversion, carbon dioxide removal, carbon dioxide transport and storage, hydrogen production with carbon management, methane emissions reduction, and critical minerals production.

Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency, said the wildfires in Tenerife and around the world were \u201creally alarming\u201d evidence of the speed of climate change, the outlet reports. It further quotes Aschbacher saying \u201cIt just confirms that climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, to humankind, and will remain so for the next decades and we do need to do everything we can to mitigate the effects\u201d. The wildfire spread to cover over 1,800 hectares (4,450 acres) in just 24 hours, with 14 aircraft and a combined 250 firefighters and military personnel tackling the blaze, reports [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wildfire-tenerife-national-park-prompts-village-evacuations-2023-08-16/). However, the region\u2019s leader, Fernando Clavijo, told an evening news conference in Tenerife\u2019s capital, Santa Cruz that \u201cthe fire is out of control\u2026 the outlook is not positive\u201d, notes Reuters.\u00a0\n\n\nIn Canada, wildfires have burnt twice as much land as any previous season, an area the equivalent size of Alabama or nine Connecticuts, reports the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/08/16/canada-wildfires-size-northwest-territories/). Nearly 33m acres (13.3m hectares) have burned, with many fires still going, it continues. Residents in the city of Yellowknife in Canada\u2019s far north were ordered to evacuate as concern grew that raging wildfires could reach it by the weekend, reports [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/climate/article/2023/08/17/canada-far-north-city-ordered-to-evacuate-amidst-raging-wildfires_6096042_96.html). Nearly 20,000 residents have been given until noon on Friday to leave their homes, after a state of emergency was declared earlier this week, it adds. There are now more than 200 wildfires burning in the\u00a0 north-west territories in Canada, including the one now 17km from Yellowknife, [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66526554?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA) reports. Those in Fort Smith, K\u2019atl\u2019odeeche First Nation, Hay River, Enterprise and Jean Marie River have all been ordered to evacuate, it adds.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the US, wildfires in northern California have also triggered evacuation orders and road closures in rural communities, reports [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/08/17/northern-california-wildfires-evacuations-near-oregon). There are 20 wildfires ignited by lightning from thunderstorms on Monday in the Klamath National Forest, where the daily record high temperature hit 112F (44C) on Wednesday, it continues. Additionally, there are five large fires burning in Oregon, where air quality advisories were issued for multiple counties, adds Axios.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Deadlier Atlantic storms excessively killing US people of colour \u2013 study**\n\n\n The Guardian [Read Article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/16/atlantic-storms-deadlier-people-of-color-excess-deaths)\n\n\n\nTropical cyclones in the Atlantic are becoming deadlier as the planet warms, reports the Guardian. Between 1988 and 2019, 179 named tropical storms and hurricanes have caused about 20,000 deaths, it adds. More than two-thirds of this death toll, as well 17 of the 20 deadliest storms, have occurred during the past 15 years as \u201cocean-heating fossil-fuel emissions have driven increasingly intense hurricanes\u201d, the article continues. This is according to a new study published in Science Advances, which looked at changes in storm-hit county\u2019s overall number of deaths before, during and after a hurricane and \u201ccompared those to normal years\u201d, reports the [Associated Press.](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-poor-vulnerable-deaths-katrina-irma-3d03c6cd94a03dc498c8e84bd2f786f4) This identified those killed indirectly by the storms, instead of just those who drowned, were hit by debris or killed in other direct ways, it notes. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between how many people died and how many people would have died on a normal day\u201d with no hurricane, said study lead author Robbie Parks, an environmental epidemiologist, AP continues. The study found these storms disproportionately affected the most socially vulnerable communities, including older adults and Indigenous, Black and Brown communities, reports the [Washington Post,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/08/16/hurricane-deaths-increasing-vulnerable-groups/) with 90% of the excess deaths in these groups. The article quotes Parks, who said: \u201cThe thing that was kind of shocking is the way that the large majority of the deaths were in\u2026socially vulnerable areas compared with the rest of the country impacted by cyclones. The poorest places in the states are by the coasts, which are repeatedly battered by cyclones.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**UK: Rishi Sunak rules out net-zero referendum**\n\n\n The Daily Telegraph [Read Article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/08/16/rishi-sunak-rules-out-net-zero-referendum/)\n\n\n\nUK prime minister Rishi Sunak has ruled out holding a referendum on net-zero, despite calls from his party to put the 2050 climate target to a public vote, reports the Daily Telegraph, in a story that features on its [frontpage](https://twitter.com/TmorrowsPapers/status/1691922658827337862/photo/1). Ministers have urged Sunak to \u201crethink the headlong rush for net-zero\u201d and commit to a vote, after the issue has become key for both the Tories and Labour in recent weeks, it continues. Sunak has stated that \u201cmost people are committed to getting to net-zero\u201d and rejected the suggestion of a Brexit-style referendum, continues the newspaper. The [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12413991/Rishi-Sunak-rejects-Tory-calls-referendum-2050-target-Net-Zero-PM-insists-theres-agreement-reducing-Britains-carbon-emissions.html) reports that Sunak said in an interview with ITV News that \u201cI have two young daughters, I care about the environment that we \u2013 I \u2013 leave them\u2026My job is to leave it in a better state than I found it\u201d. The [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/rishi-sunak-uxbridge-prime-minister-conservative-party-conservative-b2394211.html) also quotes Sunak from the interview, where he said: \u201cI think the path to net-zero has got to be one that we tread carefully, that we bring everyone along with us on that journey, and we make that journey in a proportionate and a pragmatic way\u201d. [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-rishi-sunak-rules-out-referendum-net-zero-britain-climate-plan/) notes that \u201copinion polls generally show that Brits back the headline target\u201d. It says: \u201cSupporters of the plan will be buoyed by fresh Ipsos polling Wednesday which showed a 13-point month-to-month rise in the proportion of Britons who say they are concerned about climate change and the environment. One in four (25%) of those polled now cite it as an important issue for the country, the polling shows \u2013 putting it behind only the economy and inflation and level with the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service in a ranking of voters\u2019 top issues.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAt the same time, an \u201cexclusive\u201d in the [i newspaper](https://inews.co.uk/news/rishi-sunak-offer-mps-vote-electric-cars-tory-anger-net-zero-2552098#:~:text=Rishi%20Sunak%20is%20set%20to,next%20year%2C%20i%20can%20reveal) reports that Sunak \u201cis set to give Tory MPs a chance to vote down plans to force UK car makers to produce more electric vehicles from next year\u201d. The Department of Transport will give MPs the chance to potentially veto secondary legislation needed to enact new target for vehicle manufacturers, it continues, adding: \u201cUnder plans for a so-called \u2018ZEV mandate\u2019, British car makers would from 2024 have to ensure that at least 22% of all their new cars, and 10% of their vans, are electric-powered.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**UN climate summit host UAE failed to report methane emissions to UN**\n\n\n The Guardian [Read Article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/17/un-climate-summit-host-uae-failed-report-methane-emissions)\n\n\n\nUN climate summit COP28 host the United Arab Emirates has failed to report its emissions of the greenhouse gas methane to the UN for almost a decade, the Guardian reports in an \u201cexclusive\u201d. The country\u2019s state owned oil company Adnoc has also set itself a methane leak target that is far higher that the level it claims it has already reached, the article adds. Adnoc\u2019s chief executive Sultan Al Jaber, who will preside over the climate summit, recently urged countries and companies to be \u201cbrutally honest\u201d about the inadequacy of global action on climate change, it continues. The UN\u2019s climate body requires countries to submit their methane emissions every two years, and has done since 2014, but the UAE has not submitted any reports, unlike other Middle Eastern oil states including Saufi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman, the article says. \u201cCritics say the revelations, and the UAE\u2019s huge planned expansion of oil and gas production against scientific advice, show the \u2018opposite of leadership\u2019 and undermine Al Jaber\u2019s credibility\u201d, adds the Guardian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**UK inflation slows to 6.8% in July as energy prices fall**\n\n\n Financial Times [Read Article](https://www.ft.com/content/49fe9a67-a50c-459e-8777-81accd371c57)\n\n\n\nLower gas and electricity bills have helped slow inflation, reports the Financial Times. Prices were 6.8% higher in July than in the previous year, a fall from an increase of 7.9% in June, it adds. Inflation fell in electricity, gas, milk, bread, cheese, petrol and diesel, but the rate of inflation was still high due to increases in hotels and air travel, reports [Sky News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/business-66502810). Between June and July, gas prices fell by a record 25.2%, the largest drop since the Office of National Statistics began collating the data in 1988, it continues. This story was also covered by [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/business-66502810), [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/16/uk-inflation-falls-sharply-as-cost-of-living-pressures-ease), [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/recession-inflation-interest-rates-sunak-hunt-b2394125.html), [Press Association](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/uk-world/uk-inflation-slows-to-17-month-low-after-energy-bills-fall/a1797624357.html) and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Indonesia delays plan to invest $20bn in energy transition funds**\n\n\n Reuters [Read Article](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/indonesia-delays-plan-invest-20-bln-energy-transition-funds-2023-08-16/)\n\n\n\nIndonesia has delayed plans to announce investments from a $20bn fund pledged by rich countries and global lenders to help speed a clean energy transition, reports Reuters. A coalition of nations \u2013 led by the US and Japan \u2013 pledged to mobilise public and private finance under the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), the article notes. This is designed to help Indonesia shutter coal power plants and adopt greener solutions, to ultimately advance the sector\u2019s peak emissions target to 2030, a shift of seven years, it continues. The investment plan for the JETP was expected to be made public on Wednesday, but officials have said the timeline for publication has been delayed as additional data has been added to the model. This setback follows nine months of \u201ctumultuous behind-the-scenes negotiations\u201d since the deal was announced at the G20 summit in Bali, reports [Inside Climate News](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/08/16/indonesia-jetp-green-plan/). There have been disagreements over the type of funds provided and technical challenges in ensuring the coal-to-renewables switch, the article adds. Dadan Kusdiana, Indonesia\u2019s secretary general of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, told [Climate Home News](https://climatechangenews.com/2023/08/16/indonesia-jetp-green-plan/) the government is \u201ccommitted to the energy transition\u201d, but added it had to review the technical findings \u201cto see if the targets are credible and workable\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**China adds world\u2019s biggest energy sector to anti-spy push**\n\n\n Bloomberg [Read Article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/china-adds-world-s-biggest-energy-sector-to-anti-spy-push?sref=Oz9Q3OZU#xj4y7vzkg)\n\n\n\nChina has expanded its efforts to counter espionage in the energy industry, urging both companies and agencies to prevent \u201cleaks of information in industries including nuclear power and oil\u201d, reports Bloomberg. It adds that, according to the National Energy Administration (NEA), the country\u2019s top energy regulator, \u201cforeign forces are collecting data and information to disrupt China\u2019s efforts to ensure energy security and to hinder its planning for a green transition\u201d. It continues: \u201cWhile information about those endeavours isn\u2019t as readily available as in places like the US and Europe, government agencies and research firms still regularly report data that allows companies, investors and academics to keep tabs on trends vital to global trade flows and the fight against climate change.\u201d\n\n\nSeparately, the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/16/facing-dependence-on-china-eu-battles-to-support-green-industry) quotes Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a French MEP, who says that \u201cwe [the EU] are facing dependence, particularly on China [regarding \u2018clean technologies\u2019].\u201d The state-supporting newspaper the [Global Times](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202308/1296346.shtml) carries an editorial, saying that \u201cgrowing signs\u201d suggest that the \u2018clean energy\u2019 industry is becoming the next arena for economic competition between the US and China. It adds that Washington\u2019s pursuit of \u201ceconomic security\u201d frequently adheres to a \u201chegemonic logic that no one can gain more than it does\u201d. State-backed media outlet [China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202308/16/WS64dbfe05a31035260b81c549.html) carries a comment piece by scholars Marcos Cordeiro Pires and Zhang Min, who write that China and Latin American countries\u2019 partnership on the \u201cGreen Belt and Road Initiative\u201d is \u201cvital\u201d to \u201cface the enormous problems faced by all humanity, such as the extreme weather events that hit every place in the world\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, the [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3231182/chinese-team-says-climate-change-makes-tibetan-plateaus-lakes-more-hospitable) picks a study on melting glaciers in China, which says the expansion of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau was \u201ccaused by increased precipitation and [glacial meltwater](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3209379/china-1-million-people-are-risk-glacier-melt-flooding-disaster-threat-set-grow-global-warming?module=inline&pgtype=article), both results of climate change\u201d. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-steady-markets-weigh-weak-china-data-tighter-crude-supplies-2023-08-16/) says that oil prices showed \u201clittle fluctuations\u201d as investors weighed concerns over China\u2019s struggling economy with anticipations of decreased supply in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**China initiates IV emergency response for drought in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang**\n\n\n National Business Daily [Read Article](https://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2023-08-16/2963455.html)\n\n\n\nChina National Disaster Reduction Commission has initiated a level IV emergency response for drought in northern China\u2019s Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Xinjiang, reports the [National Business Daily](https://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2023-08-16/2963455.html), a Chinese economic newspaper, citing a report by the state broadcaster CCTV. It adds that the commission warned south-west China will expect heavy rains and storms at the same time.\n\n\nThe Chinese outlet [Jimian](https://www.jiemian.com/article/9930728.html) reports that the carbon price at the national carbon market on Tuesday surpassed 70 yuan ($9.6) per tonne, \u201cmarking a new record high since the opening\u201d of the carbon market in July. The policy by the ministry of ecology and environment says that the quotas held by emission control companies for the first compliance period (2019-20) can be used for offsetting compliance in the second compliance period (2021-22), as well as for trading in the carbon market, the article adds. The state-run industry newspaper [China Electric Power News](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2TkUsHZdi9lgJzrQYlDXrw) has published an article by Zhao Zenghai, director of the National Renewable Energy Information Management Center. He writes that the new policy on \u201cgreen certificates\u201d will create a \u201csynergistic policy approach between green certificates and the national carbon emissions trading system, collectively supporting actions toward achieving the \u2018dual carbon\u2019 targets\u201d.\n\n\nAnother article by [China Electric Power News](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wxpOSk14-xV7GkTcsVLySw) reports that, according to Chinese national oil company CNOOC, the country\u2019s \u201cfirst large-scale project\u201d for the development of thin coalbed methane has been put into operation. It adds that thin coalbed generally refers to coal seams with \u201can underground mining thickness of less than 1.3 metres, which has long been regarded as marginal resources in coalbed methane development\u201d. The operation holds \u201csignificant importance\u201d in ensuring national energy security, says the article. Another article by [Jiemian](https://www.jiemian.com/article/9934772.html) covers the same news.\u00a0\n\n\nElsewhere, a third article by [Jiemian](https://www.jiemian.com/article/9925932.html) reports that the electricity consumption of \u201cthe second industries\u201d, which includes mining, manufacturing and construction, reached 538 terawatts-hours nationwide in July, marking a year-on-year growth of 5.7%. The Chinese outlet [21st Century Business Herald](https://www.21jingji.com/article/20230816/herald/547d3d098f3ee4fe4d4e10391b1dd03f.html) quotes Li Gao, director general of the Department of Climate Change at the ministry of ecology and environment, saying: \u201cthere is still significant policy space for advancing climate-related investment and financing, including creating a conducive policy environment.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Hundreds evacuated in India\u2019s Himalayan state amid monsoon mayhem**\n\n\n Al Jazeera [Read Article](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/8/16/photos-hundreds-evacuated-in-indias-himalayan-state-amid-monsoon-mayhem)\n\n\n\nHundreds have been evacuated in the north Indian state of Himachal Pradesh as rescuers continue to hunt for people feared missing in floods and landslides, Al Jazeera reports. The state\u2019s chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu described the disaster as \u201cthe worst to hit [the state] in the past 50 years\u201d, while experts told the outlet that climate change \u201cis increasing the frequency and severity\u201d of landslides and flash floods in the monsoon. State officials told [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/himachal-pradesh-rain-toll-71-1700-rescued-as-dam-water-floods-kangra/articleshow/102782892.cms) that 71 people have been killed in the disaster \u201ctriggered by torrential downpour and cloudbursts since Sunday\u201d, while the release of water from the Pong hydroelectric dam \u201cnecessitat[ed] a large-scale rescue operation of more than 1,700 people so far\u201d in the low-lying areas of Kangra district.\n\n\nElsewhere, water resources experts told the [Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unviable-arunachal-hydro-projects-have-been-dumped-on-central-psus-say-experts/article67190744.ece) that 12 hydroelectric projects in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh signed over to state-run utilities on Saturday are \u201ceconomically unviable\u201d and a \u201cguarantee[d] disaster\u201d for the state and downstream regions. India\u2019s renewable energy minister RK Singh \u201cjustified the government\u2019s push for hydropower as it would contribute to the objective of net-zero carbon emissions by 2070\u201d, according to the story. Another story in the [Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nagaland-village-councils-pledge-to-stir-against-forest-conservation-amendment-act/article67196829.ece) reports that Indigenous village councils in the sister state of Nagaland have pledged to oppose a new forest conservation act legislated this month to meet the country\u2019s carbon sink target, which they say is \u201cdesigned against the interests of Indigenous communities\u201d. In his independence day speech on 15 August, prime minister Narendra Modi said India \u201chas achieved the green targets it had set for itself much ahead of schedule and has shown the world the way to fight climate change\u201d, [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-showing-the-way-to-fight-climate-change-pm-narendra-modi-on-independence-day-4299738) reported.\n\n\nSeparately, [The Third Pole](https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/regional-cooperation/analysis-india-and-nepal-overlooking-environmental-issues-while-signing-hydropower-deals/) analyses how \u201chigh-profile intergovernmental discussions\u201d between India and Nepal especially on hydropower deals \u201cusually overlook climate change\u201d, while a comic-style illustrated article in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2023/india-populous-region-climate-change/) looks at how climate change is impacting the Indo-Gangetic plain.\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Climate and energy comment.\n\n\n\n**The Inflation Reduction Act took US climate action global**\n\n\n Gina McCarthy, Time [Read Article](https://time.com/6305001/inflation-reduction-act-what-happens-next/)\n\n\n\nIn its first year, the Inflation Reduction Ace (IRA) has been a \u201cgame changer\u201d, spurring a \u201crace to the top\u201d, writes Gina McCarthy, the first White House National Climate Advisor and former US Environmental Protection Agency administrator, in Time. \u201cThe world\u2019s major economies rushed to develop their own competitive climate plans and opened up unprecedented opportunities to take a big bite out of global carbon emissions while enhancing domestic economies, growing good-paying clean energy jobs, saving families money, and improving air quality and health outcomes \u2013 especially for communities most in need,\u201d she continues. McCarthy urges the US to go further though, to push harder to move fossil fuels out of domestic and international energy systems, to ensure developed countries meet or exceed their commitments to developing countries, and to entice more private sector investment, suggesting a carbon credit trading system could support this. \u201cSo on this one-year anniversary of the IRA, let\u2019s do more than celebrate its ongoing success and push to keep implementing its provisions fast and furiously,\u201d concludes McCarthy.\u00a0\n\n\nElsewhere, a [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-08-16/la-inflation-reduction-act-1-year-anniversary-climate-action) editorial has \u201cfive takeaways\u201d from the first year of the act. In related news, an \u201cexclusive\u201d in the [Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4154516-exclusive-federal-analysis-says-ira-infrastructure-law-could-save-customers-billions-on-energy-bills/) reports on projections from the US Energy Department, which show \u201cthe Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law could save Americans up to $38bn on electricity costs over the remainder of the decade\u201d. At the same time, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/total-cost-of-joe-biden-s-inflation-reduction-act-is-rising-one-year-later?sref=Oz9Q3OZU) reports that \u201cthe uncapped incentives of the Inflation Reduction Act mean spending sparked by the historic US climate law could triple initial estimates and push past $1tn\u201d. And [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/15/anniversary-of-climate-bill-deal-democrats-want-more-00108357) reports that, on the anniversary of the act, \u201cmany Democrats are already talking about the next climate law\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**The Guardian view on protecting corals: what lies beneath matters too**\n\n\n Editorial, The Guardian [Read Article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/16/the-guardian-view-on-protecting-corals-what-lies-beneath-matters-too)\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen images of the climate emergency\u2019s impact are so visceral and so widespread, it is easy to neglect what we cannot see,\u201d says a Guardian editorial, which warns that humans must remember the damage being done to coral reefs, which sit often unseen. While coral reefs account for just 0.1% of the surface area of the ocean, they support a quarter of the world\u2019s known marine life, and an estimated half a billion people, it notes. But reef cover has halved since the 1950s, \u201cwith the rate of loss accelerating\u201d, driven by record temperatures leading to bleaching events. Work is underway, and the focus must be on prevention, writes the Guardian, reducing pollutants and tackling damage from tourism and overfishing, but \u201cthe only real solution is to slash the use of fossil fuels\u201d. People cannot be shocked into change, the paper says. Instead \u201chumans need to be confronted not only by the haunting images of ghost reefs, with life and colour drained from them, but also by the wonder of those that are still healthy, with their fabulous, fantastical populations. Contemplating these ecosystems in all their rainbow glory reminds us not only of what we have lost, but what we must protect\u201d, the article concludes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**There is no green \u2018transition\u2019 to renewable energy. China and India are playing us for fools**\n\n\n David Blackmon, The Daily Telegraph [Read Article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/08/16/renewable-energy-green-transition-power/)\n\n\n\nThere is no green \u201ctransition\u201d, argues David Blackmon, a writer, podcaster and [self-described](https://twitter.com/EnergyAbsurdity) \u201cminer of absurdities\u201d, in an article for the Daily Telegraph, in which he highlights that in 2022, the human race burned more coal, oil and gas than ever before. He points to increases in German imports of US natural gas, and suggests China has prioritised energy security over climate change. China has been \u201chappy to let western developed nations sacrifice economic and grid stability in pursuit of \u2018net-zero by 2050\u2019 goals while it has continued to commission hundreds of new coal-fired power plants and become the world\u2019s biggest importer of crude oil\u201d, writes Blackmon. (China\u2019s renewables and nuclear sector has reached 50.9% of the country\u2019s power capacity, meaning it has hit its 2025 energy transition target two years early, [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/china-briefing-15-june-cbam-fight-new-energy-milestone-extreme-heat/) reported in June.). \u201cWhat it all boils down to is this: the prevailing narrative being pushed by policymakers, activists and much of the western news media of an energy transition that will dramatically reduce the use of fossil fuels and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is a fantasy. The direction and pace of whatever transition ultimately occurs will be dictated by real-world complexities and events, not by schemes promoted in Brussels, Washington DC and London\u201d, Blackmon concludes.\n\n\n\n\n\n#### New climate research.\n\n\n\n**A global picture of methane emissions from rivers and streams**\n\n\n Nature [Read Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06344-6)\n\n\n\nA new study finds that rivers and streams account for roughly equal emissions of methane \u2013 a potent greenhouse gas \u2013 as other freshwater systems. The new study compiles all published data on riverine methane concentrations and emissions into a new database then uses machine-learning tools to predict methane concentrations and emissions globally. The findings suggest that while temperature does not appear to be a main driver of the 27.9m tonnes of methane per year emitted by rivers and streams globally, human modifications \u2013 such as water-treatment plants, ditches and canals \u2013 can be a factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Short-term excess mortality following tropical cyclones in the US**\n\n\n Science Advances [Read Article](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg6633#:~:text=Where%20posterior%20probabilities%20of%20excess,force%20excess%20deaths%20occurred%20more)\n\n\n\nA study examines excess deaths in the aftermath of cyclones in the US over more than three decades. The researchers combined death registration data with a comprehensive record of 179 tropical cyclones between 1988 and 2019 to estimate short-term excess deaths in the wake of such events. The study finds that the deadliest event was Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with 1,491 excess deaths including 719 in Orleans Parish alone. The authors warn that \u201ctrends of heightened activity and increased intensity of tropical cyclones in recent years indicate that tropical cyclone exposure is, and will remain, a major public health concern\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Future emergence of new ecosystems caused by glacial retreat**\n\n\n Nature [Read Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06302-2)\n\n\n\nBy 2100, the decline of glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica could produce new terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems over an area the size of Nepal or Finland, suggests a new study. Depending on future emissions, the area covered by glaciers could reduce by 22-51%, exposing new areas and leading to the rapid development of \u201cpost-glacial ecosystems\u201d, the study says. Noting that less than half of glaciers are located in protected areas, the authors emphasise the need to \u201curgently and simultaneously enhance climate-change mitigation and the in situ protection of these ecosystems to secure their existence, functioning and values\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Other

Doing so will allow clean sources to more effectively compete against coal and other damaging fossil-fuel-reliant technologies and products that have too often avoided accountability for the global climate and health damages they caused.\n\n \n **Read more:** *[How the Inflation Reduction Act Has Reshaped the U.S.\u2014and The World](https://time.com/6304143/inflation-reduction-act-us-global-impact/)*\n\n In the U.S., companies have announced or moved forward with projects in 44 states since the IRA was passed, accounting for more than [170,600 new clean energy jobs and $278 billion in new investments](https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2023/07/Clean-Energy-Boom-Anniversary-Report-1.pdf). Our [goals](https://americaisallin.com/Beyond50) under the Paris Agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 are now within reach. The U.S. can head to the global COP28 climate negotiations this fall ready to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\n\n \n But as we celebrate the biggest climate investment the U.S. has ever made, let\u2019s also recognize that we can, should, and must do more now to reduce\u2014and over time eliminate\u2014our reliance on fossil fuels. And we must support developing nations on this path as well. We cannot solely rely on the fast buildup of clean energy if we hope to deliver net zero by 2050. We must demand reductions in fossil fuel exploration, development, and use now to ensure the transition to a cleaner, safer, healthier, and more stable world for all countries.\n\n First, let\u2019s push harder to nudge fossil fuels out of domestic and international markets and shift to energy systems that meet the needs of developing countries at lower costs. This will not only help strengthen economies but also create cleaner air to breathe. African nations, for example, can benefit greatly from leapfrogging to a clean energy future and yet over the last 20 years, [only 2%](https://www.irena.org/publications/2022/Jan/Renewable-Energy-Market-Analysis-Africa) of global renewable energy investments were made in Africa. Meanwhile, investments for polluting oil and gas projects, including from American and European multinationals, continue to pour in, at a great cost to the continent.\n\n Second, we must push to ensure that every developed country meets or exceeds its country-level commitments already made to the developing world, as well as marshall the global public finance resources commanded by the World Bank and regional development banks. And we must demand full and fair consideration of the costs of political inaction versus the full benefits of public investment in climate action. As Barbados Prime Minister [Mia Motley](https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2022/6177695/mia-mottley/) so clearly articulated when announcing the [Bridgetown Initiative](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-bridgetown-initiative-asking-paris-financial-summit-2023-06-20/) last [September](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/09/23/mia-mottley-builds-global-coalition-to-make-financial-system-fit-for-climate-action/), developing nations need multilateral development banks to focus on their missions, not just higher returns, so nations can open up private investments in ways that work for them, define their own paths toward economic security, and deliver the transition to clean energy we need.\n\n \n **Read more:** *[Here's How to Actually Make Rich Countries Pay For Their Climate Impact](https://time.com/6225264/climate-reparations-rich-countries-barbados/)*\n\n Third, public investments are simply not enough; we must entice more private sector investment in the developing world if we hope to preserve and protect the world\u2019s critical natural resources and support the growth and development of clean energy economies that align with country-specific needs and opportunities.\n\n A functioning carbon credit trading system can entice private investments\u2014lowering project costs as credits are generated and sold to corporations and other institutions\u2014as a way to meet their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments. Unfortunately, concerns about greenwashing and months of debate about new and improved carbon market rules have left both sellers and buyers facing significant uncertainties that are stalling investment and frustrating corporations and institutions. What we need is a more realistic and credible system that utilizes the latest technologies, ensures transparency, and jumpstarts finance to prevent further deforestation and meet the clean energy needs of developing countries.\n\n It is time for all of us to stop turning a blind eye to the developing world when it continues to be hit by climate impacts first and worst, when it has contributed the least to the climate crisis, and when it literally has the fewest resources available to respond to the havoc that climate change is wreaking. Just last month, for example, India [stopped exporting rice](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-prohibits-export-non-basmati-white-rice-notice-2023-07-20/#:~:text=NEW%20DELHI%2C%20July%2020%20(Reuters,inflation%20on%20global%20food%20markets)\u2014food that 40% of the world currently relies on as a staple in their diets\u2014when they were hit by heavy monsoon rains that damaged domestic crops. The impact will be far-reaching: Farmers will lose crops and money, while families suffer from hunger, malnutrition, and other life-threatening health challenges.\n\n \n So on this one-year anniversary of the IRA, let\u2019s do more than celebrate its ongoing success and push to keep implementing its provisions fast and furiously. Let\u2019s push [Congress](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-thwaites/us-international-climate-finance-fails-again-meet-moment) to meet our international climate financing commitments to provide $11.4 billion per year by 2024 to the developing world. Let\u2019s equip developing nations with the resources they need to secure their place in a clean energy future. Let\u2019s encourage our government leaders to work across all international venues to open up public and private sector investments for the good of our families, our communities, our countries, and our world.\n\n \n\nMore Must-Reads From TIME\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n* **[She Wasn't Able to Get An Abortion.

The forecast comes after Barclays first earmarked late 2022 and 2023 as the potential tipping point period for voluntary carbon markets back in 2020.\n\n\nUsing data from three major carbon credit registries covering a period between 2008 to 2023 - which comprised over 1.6bn issued CO2 credits 755 million credits retired - Barclays' Investment Sciences team found that renewables have been the largest source of offsets to date, with agricultural credits also growing.\n\n\nHowever, the most rapid growth area in 2023 thus far has been in demand offsets, which are those purchased for voluntary use rather than to comply with legally-binding emissions reduction obligations.\n\n\nAs such, Barclays found the top five buyers of carbon offsets by volume were Delta Air Lines, Volkswagen, Shell, Primax Colombia and Telstra Corp.\n\n\nMoreover, alongside aviation sector giants Boeing, Easyjet, Jet2 and AirFrance, household names such as Disney, Nespresso, Etsy, Netflix, Apple, Octopus and BrewDog also featured in Barclays' top 100 offset buyers list released this week.\n\n\nHowever, the bank warned that nature and biodiversity remained a \"missing part of the net zero puzzle\", as it highlighted the growing opportunity for the voluntary carbon market to tap into biodiversity-related investment, amid growing corporate interest in supporting the natural world and the role of nature-based climate solutions in achieving net zero.\n\n\nBut while it claimed four key industries - energy, finance, agriculture and agricultural tech, and monitoring and verification - were most likely to benefit from the biodiversity investment opportunity, it added that companies investing in nature-based solutions today are likely to face lower offset costs moving forwards.\n\n\nBarclays' assessment stressed that cutting emissions should always be the top priority for society, governments and businesses, but that there would still be a need to offset residual emissions in hard-to-abate industries in order to meet climate goals.\n\n\n\"For us, doing something is better than doing nothing,\" it said in the report. \"The potential of nature-based solutions - covering forestry, carbon farming and blue carbon - is material, at up to 12GT a year. Add in credits covering emerging technologies, such as Direct Air Capture with Carbon Storage and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage, and we estimate the overall market could reach in excess of 15GT a year.\"\n\n\nThe report argues voluntary carbon markets could therefore play a \"key role\" in accelerating progress towards net zero goals by acting as a vehicle for private capital to flow to developing countries. It also said that a defined set of standards setting benchmark price and the adoption of verification processes - such as the Core Carbon Principles [launched by the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets in March](https://www.businessgreen.com/news-analysis/4089307/integrity-councils-global-benchmark-prove-watershed-moment-carbon-market) - could see the market play a pivotal role in accelerating \"least-cost decarbonisation\".\n\n\n\"Continued failure to mobilise finance for mitigation efforts in developing countries represents a large source of physical climate risk as this is precisely where emissions are projected to rise the most and thus where capital has the greatest potential impact on emissions, particularly in facilitating early-stage transition movements such as the decoupling from coal,\" it states.\u00a0\n\n\n\"A second-level effect of the voluntary carbon market is that it sets financial incentives for policymakers to protect carbon sinks, generating additional positive environmental impacts by protecting nature-based solutions as well as creating positive co-benefits for biodiversity.\"\n\n\nThe assessment came alongside related carbon credit news today from Heavy Finance - a European climate tech investment marketplace for the agricultural industry -which has set out plans to generate 250,000 carbon credits in the UK and Europe in 2024.\n\n\nThe bulk of these carbon credits, which are expected to remove 250,000 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere, are to be generated in Poland, Lithuania and Bulgaria with a view to expanding across Europe over the next 18 months.\n\n\nThe investments are expected to raise funds for no-tillage and sustainable farming practices to remove CO2 and tackle food shortages across Europe, HeavyFinance added.\u00a0\n\n\n***Keep up to date with all the latest green business news by*** [***signing up to the free Daily and Weekly BusinessGreen Newsletters***](https://incisive-business.msgfocus.com/k/Incisive-Business/bg_nlsuf)\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The voluntary carbon market could be worth $250bn by 2030 and $1.5tn by 2050, according to Barclays.

The Science-Based Targets initiative is making the case for direct action on carbon management, and more business leaders are joining the movement. Those left behind may find themselves at risk of reputational damage unless they do their homework and approach carbon offsets with caution.\n\n\nScience-Based Targets: Follow the money\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nThe Science-Based Targets initiative [launched in 2015](https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2015/why-we-need-science-based-targets-cop21/57471) as a means to\u00a0steer the massive resources of private capital toward [effective climate solutions](https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2019/what-science-based-targets-mean-sports-and-entertainment-sector/83361) that are based on science. SBTi provides companies with the tools to set [net-zero carbon emission goals](https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2020/inevitability-sustainable-covid-19-recovery/120351) for their own operations and take effective steps toward reaching those goals.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cScience-based targets show companies and financial institutions how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent the worst effects of climate change,\u201d SBTi explains.\n\n\nThe organization\u2019s ability to muster financial firepower has been growing. It launched in partnership with business and environmental organizations including the\u00a0United Nations Global Compact,\u00a0CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), WRI (World Resources Institute) and WWF (the World Wide Fund for Nature). The We Mean Business Coalition also signed its members on to the initiative. And in 2021, SBTi closed out its net-zero [Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/business-ambition-for-1-5c/) after recruiting 1,000 companies.\n\n\nMembers of the campaign now represent more than $23 trillion in market capitalization, topping the entire GDP of the United States, according to SBTi.\n\n\nBy the end of last year, membership climbed to more than 4,000 companies accounting for more than 33 percent of the market capitalization of the entire global economy. The number includes those committed to setting targets as well as those that have already started the process.\n\n\nWhat a difference the U.S. makes\n--------------------------------\n\n\nAnother indication of the growing influence of the Science-Based Targets initiative\u00a0came on August 3 when the U.S. branch of the global organization [Ad Net Zero](https://adnetzero.com/) updated its recruiting numbers.\n\n\nThe Ad Net Zero parent organization formed in the U.K in 2020 with the goal of shifting consumer behavior, as well as helping the advertising industry reduce its carbon footprint. Last June, the organization announced that its members are required to commit to net-zero targets through the SBTi or a comparable alternative, such as the U.N. Race to Zero or The Climate Pledge.\n\n\nThe U.S. branch launched in February 2023 under a partnership with 18 leading industry organizations, including the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A\u2019s), the\u00a0Association of National Advertisers and\u00a0Interactive Advertising Bureau.\u00a0\n\n\nThe addition of a branch in the U.S. had a significant impact on the global reach of Ad Net Zero. As described by the U.S. branch, the global organization now covers a market that accounts for 45 percent of all advertising expenditures, with the U.S. market alone accounting for 40 percent.\n\n\nIn its latest update, [Ad Net Zero U.S.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/03/2718018/0/en/Ad-Net-Zero-US-Triples-Supporter-Base-In-First-Six-Months.html) listed brands and advertisers including Molson Coors, Uber, 51toCarbonZero, Acceptable Ads Committee, Brand Safety Institute, BSV Digital Displays, GMR, Integral Ad Science, LoopMe, woman- and LGBT-owned The Mixx, Murphy Cobb and Scope3 among its most recent members. The firm ThanksToYou also recently joined as its first member focusing on the Latin America market.\n\n\nThe power of collaboration\n--------------------------\n\n\nOf course, it is easy for companies to sign on to various pledges and letters of support to advocate for climate action. Following up with actual action steps is the hard part. But collaboration can help companies pool their resources and share best practices.\n\n\nThe companies that sign on to the Ad Net Zero organization are leveraging collaboration to maximize their effectiveness. In addition to insisting on concrete action steps consistent with science-based targets, Ad Net Zero draws on the diverse resources of its members and partners to provide industry-specific training and guidance.\n\n\nThe U.S. branch, for example, reports that its 70-strong membership includes global-level supporters and agency holding company subsidiaries. Together, the 70 members represent \u201ca spectrum of companies across the advertising ecosystem, from brands and agencies to production, advertising technology and media.\u201d\n\n\nTo the extent that the U.S. advertising industry of the 20th century steered consumer behavior toward carbon intensity, perhaps the 21st-century advertising model will become equally effective in the opposite direction.\n\n\nThe signs are pointing in the right direction. The global Ad Net Zero organization has partnered on education, measurement and training initiatives with other organizations including the World Advertising Federation\u2019s Global Alliance for Responsible Media and the U.K. nonprofit carbon calculator AdGreen. In addition, experienced members like Meta and Accenture are combining their expertise and communications resources.\n\n\nAd Net Zero also notes that eight of the 10 biggest advertising agencies in the world are members, along with three of the biggest brand advertisers. The top three companies in the ad tech sector are also represented. In 2021, these three companies alone serviced 74 percent of online ad spending, as well as 47 percent of all advertising dollars.\n\n\n\u201cAll for None\u201d and the potential power of carbon offsets\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs befits the creative resources at its disposal, the global Ad Net Zero organization adopted the clever slogan, \"All for None.\u201d By evoking the capability of each individual to make a difference in collaborative action toward net zero, that message can resonate with individual consumers as well as business leaders.\n\n\nThe consumer angle could offer a way forward for carbon offsets, which have increasingly come under fire for promising more than they can deliver.\n\n\nIn January, for example, The Guardian [reported on an investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) into the leading voluntary carbon offset standard Verra, in which the news organization concluded: \u201cForest carbon offsets approved by the world\u2019s leading certifier and used by Disney, Shell, Gucci and other big corporations are largely worthless and could make global heating worse.\u201d\n\n\nIn May, [CNBC reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/registries-in-carbon-offset-market-allowing-dubious-credits-report.html) on an analysis of almost 300 global carbon offset projects, accounting for 11 percent of all carbon credits sold to date. The analysis was undertaken by researchers at the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project. \u201cMajor registries in the carbon offset market are systematically over-crediting projects and delivering dubious carbon offsets, allowing some companies to claim more climate benefits than deserved,\u201d wrote Emma Newburger of CNBC in summary.\u00a0\n\n\nStill, global groups like the World Economic Forum [continue to support](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/carbon-offsetting-rainforest-sylvera/) carbon offsets, and the availability of new data could improve transparency and reliability. However, WEF also cautions that carbon accounting is \u201cfiendishly complex.\u201d\n\n\nCompanies seeking to reduce their carbon footprints are best advised to join the Science-Based Targets initiative\u00a0or a comparable organization. SBTi, for example, requires companies to take direct action within their own operations and value chains, without relying on offsets.\n\n\nOn the other hand, SBTi does not entirely exclude carbon offsets. \u201cOffsets are only considered to be an option for companies wanting to finance additional emission reductions beyond their science-based targets (SBT) or net-zero targets,\u201d\u00a0[the organization explains](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/faqs).\n\n\nThat leaves the door open for consumer engagement. Deloitte is among the analysts expecting more companies to use point-of-purchase offsets to promote their brands, with the help of apps and other user-friendly technologies.\n\n\n\u201cSeveral categories of consumer spending, including food, transportation and entertainment, could easily incorporate an option to purchase carbon offsets,\u201d Deloitte noted in a [July report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions.html#consumers-increase).\n\n\nIn that regard, the creative talent of the advertising industry could provide a loud, meaningful counterbalance to the [torrent of Republican-led attacks on ESG](https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2023/anti-woke-legislation/764301) (environmental, social and governance) business principles.\n\n\nRed flags about carbon offsets abound, but with sufficient transparency, reliability and user-friendliness, they could become an important way to stimulate individual action on climate change and help motivate consumers to adjust their purchasing habits to prioritize sustainability and circularity.\u00a0\n\n\n*Image credits:\u00a0[Markus Spiske](https://unsplash.com/photos/d7FbDJkJSFw)/Unsplash*\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Companies that rely mainly on carbon offsets to build their sustainability profiles may be facing trouble ahead.

Explore our global CO2 strategy with Lorenzo Bernasconi, Callum Lee and Ruben Lubowski, from our Climate and Environmental Solutions Team at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.\n\n \u00a0\n\n ### How do carbon markets work?\u2005 What is their objective?\n\n Carbon markets are a tool for achieving cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. By putting a price on carbon, and creating a financial value for emissions reduction, carbon markets encourage investments and business models that favour cleaner technologies and practices.\n\n The [global carbon market](https://www.lombardodier.com/home/rethink-sustainability/the-global-carbon-market-opportu.html) is, in reality, two markets \u2013 regulated carbon offsets and voluntary carbon offsets \u2013 which together are estimated to be worth close to USD 1 trillion. In regulated markets, businesses must buy and surrender government certificates to cover each tonne of CO2 emitted as a result of their activities. A predetermined number of certificates are put up for auction by governments each year. This number is then reduced over time to limit availability and make pollution more costly. Businesses that do not comply must pay a fine that is significantly higher than the price of a certificate.\n\n The European carbon market successfully reduced electric power sector emissions by 43% between 2005 and 2021 What makes this concept so smart is that it puts a cap on total pollution and leaves it to the market to find the most effective way of reducing emissions. Regulated markets have proved to be highly successful \u2013 for example, the European carbon market succeeded in reducing the electric power sector\u2019s emissions by 43% between 2005 and 2021, without any adverse impact on GDP growth. This success has driven strong market growth over the past few years.\n\n Read also: [\u2018Net-zero economic growth\u2019 need not be a contradiction](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/responsible-capital/2021/september/net-zero-economic-growth-need-no.html)\n\n The voluntary market operates on the basis of carbon-removal projects. In nature-based carbon removal projects developers often buy or lease land for planting trees with the aim of reducing the quantity of carbon in the atmosphere. They then apply for a credit corresponding to the CO2 reduction achieved over the period concerned. These credits may then be sold to investors, who can \u2018offset\u2019 the credited carbon reductions against their own emissions in order to achieve their climate objectives. The voluntary market is primarily intended for businesses committed to\u2005\u2018net zero\u2019, who currently represent an economic strength of USD 38 trillion in terms of stock market capitalisation1. This market will also play an increasing role in meeting country commitments under the Paris Agreement. Driven by these trends, the voluntary market is growing apace. In addition to its role in reducing emissions, the market is also important due to its on-the-ground role in preserving some of the world\u2019s most ecologically-essential ecologies \u2013 it is the key to mobilising the necessary funding for [nature conservation and restoration](https://www.lombardodier.com/home/rethink-sustainability/investing-in-our-natural-capital.html).\n\n \u00a0\n\n ### What are the factors to be considered when it comes to\u2005the future of carbon pricing?\n\n We have extensive modelling expertise and apply a quantitative and probability-based approach to predicting the price of carbon. In other words, we conduct a fundamental modelling analysis, before examining the various political scenarios and market catalysts in order to formulate our short and medium-term price projections. We also benefit from the expert research provided by Lombard Odier \u2013 such as the Climate Value Impact (CVI) analyses, which provide a highly granular view of future emissions and reduction solutions \u2013 which is then fed into our models.\n\n Read also: [The unexpected portfolio \u2013 a holistic approach to investing for net zero](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/ft-rethink/2021/september/the-unexpected-portfolio--a-holi.html)\n\n \u00a0\n\n ### How are the risks associated with carbon market investment managed? And what are the most common risks that investors should be aware of?\n\n A number of risks need to be factored in when investing in carbon. The first is the possibility that governments might cut back their climate change efforts. There is also the risk presented by economic factors, such as a major recession, that might affect demand for carbon credits as a result of lower industrial production. Diversification is the key to managing these risks. Our strategy draws on an extensive investment universe in terms of both markets and instruments and strategies, thereby minimising the impact of such risks. We have in-depth knowledge of the quality of the various standards applying in this area. We also analyse specific projects in conjunction with leading credit rating agencies.\n\n According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group, carbon markets could see a sixfold increase in size between now and 2030 Read also: [Putting an end to deforestation \u2013 starting local, going global](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/ft-rethink/2022/august/putting-an-end-to-deforestation-.html)\n\n    ###  Sign up for our newsletter\n\n        Email Please enter a valid email address.\n\n        Mr Mrs Select an Option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Title       Firstname Please enter your firstname.\n\n      Lastname Please enter your lastname.\n\n          Switzerland France United Kingdom Spain Italy United Arab Emirates Singapore   Afghanistan \u00c5land Islands Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Brunei Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Cape Verde Cayman Islands Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos Islands Colombia Comoros Congo Cook Islands Costa Rica C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Croatia Cuba Cura\u00e7ao Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Falkland Islands Faroe Islands Fiji Finland France French Guiana French Polynesia French Southern Territories Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland Grenada Guadeloupe Guam Guatemala Guernsey Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Heard Island And McDonald Islands Honduras Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Isle Of Man Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jersey Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macao Macedonia Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Martinique Mauritania Mauritius Mayotte Mexico Micronesia Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Montserrat Morocco Mozambique Myanmar Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands Netherlands Antilles New Caledonia New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue Norfolk Island North Korea Northern Mariana Islands Norway Oman Pakistan Palau Palestine Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Pitcairn Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Reunion Romania Russia Rwanda Saint Barth\u00e9lemy Saint Helena Saint Kitts And Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Martin Saint Pierre And Miquelon Saint Vincent And The Grenadines Samoa San Marino Sao Tome And Principe Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Sint Maarten (Dutch part) Slovakia Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa South Georgia And The South Sandwich Islands South Korea South Sudan Spain Sri Lanka Sudan Suriname Svalbard And Jan Mayen Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syria Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand The Democratic Republic Of Congo Timor-Leste Togo Tokelau Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks And Caicos Islands Tuvalu U.S. Virgin Islands Uganda Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Minor Outlying Islands Uruguay Uzbekistan Vanuatu Vatican Venezuela Vietnam Wallis And Futuna Western Sahara Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe  Select an Option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Country of residence  Please select your country.\n\n     I'm not a US resident or citizen  This field is mandatory.\n\n         register now    Something happened, message not sent.         ### How do you see the carbon markets evolving in the coming years?\n\n We believe that the carbon markets will continue to expand over the coming years \u2013 this growth will be seen particularly in new markets, such as China, South Korea and Australia. According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group, carbon markets could see a sixfold increase in size between now and 2030. We believe that the expansion of these markets presents significant opportunities for investors, given that these new markets will impose much more restrictive emissions caps. At the same time, we also think that the pressure exerted to achieve climate objectives will be a major driving factor. At present, carbon prices are negotiated at the global level and are well below the price required to achieve our current climate objectives, which are increasingly being enshrined in legislation. This highlights the need for a fivefold increase in the carbon price within the next few years.\n\n Finally, we also examine the impact that implementation of the Paris Agreement will have on the voluntary carbon market. Most countries are likely to make use of the carbon markets to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, and this paves the way to an exciting new carbon credits market which we intend to monitor closely.\n\n Read also: [Challenge or opportunity? Rethinking hard-to-abate sectors](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/responsible-capital/2021/september/challenge-or-opportunity-rethink.html)\n\n \u00a0\n\n ### What is so exciting about these opportunities?\n\n Although the market has more than doubled in size since 2019, less than a quarter of global emissions are tied to a price. As the Lombard\u00a0Odier 3+1 framework2\u00a0shows, carbon emissions pricing will be the key to [achieving global \u2018net zero\u2019](https://www.lombardodier.com/home/rethink-sustainability/net-zero.html). Carbon markets and the creation of a [CLIC\u00ae economy](https://www.lombardodier.com/clic) (one that is Circular, Lean, Inclusive and Clean) will be the most effective tools for achieving this.\n\n To date, carbon markets have consisted almost exclusively of participants that are compelled to use them \u2013 this has created inefficiencies. In addition, in many of the largest global economies carbon markets have barely seen the light of day. We think that they have the potential to increase significantly. These are perhaps the most exciting opportunities for investment presented by climate transition.\n\n Carbon prices on the principal markets have been one of the most profitable asset classes over the last five years ### Why should investors consider including carbon credits in their investment portfolios?\n\n Firstly, there is the possibility of obtaining attractive returns. Carbon prices on the principal markets have been one of the most profitable asset classes over the last five years. They also have excellent advantages in terms of portfolio diversification thanks to their low correlation with other asset classes. Also, many carbon markets price in inflation protection \u2013 for instance, the carbon price cap in California has increased every year by 5% more than the consumer price index.\n\n Further, a number of analyses conducted in this area suggest that just a small allocation to carbon markets is sufficient to protect the rest of a global portfolio against the adverse financial effects associated with the global climate transition. Currently, most portfolios are primarily positioned to benefit from carbon in the short term and from climate change in the long term, which makes the addition of carbon a very attractive proposition.\n\n   \n \u00a0\n\n 1SBTI, May 2022: Companies committed to cutting emissions in line with climate science now represent USD $38 trillion in terms of the global economy - Science Based Targets  \n 2\u00a0Energy, land, oceans and materials.\n\n     Important information\n---------------------\n\n  This document is issued by Bank Lombard Odier & Co Ltd or an entity of the Group (hereinafter \u201cLombard Odier\u201d).

That\u2019s a better noncompliance rate than the 20% projection the city forecast for the initial compliance period, which runs from 2024 to 2029.\n\nThe law requires structures larger than 25,000 square feet to cut their carbon emissions starting in January 2024. Buildings that don\u2019t comply will have to pay up to $268 per ton of carbon equivalent over their limit. For the worst emitters, that could add up to millions of dollars per year.\n\n\u201cThis shows that the law is having its desired effect, that building owners are finding the resources and the technologies to come into compliance, and that they are taking it seriously,\u201d Aggarwala said.\n\nThe progress is partly the result of retrofit work and sustainability upgrades that have already been done at large buildings across the city, according to a DEP spokesman.\n\nIt\u2019s also the result of a city-run accelerator program that advises buildings on how they can become more energy efficient, as well as the fact that \u201ca lot of these things pay for themselves,\u201d Aggarwala said.\n\nPete Sikora, climate and inequality campaigns director at New York Communities for Change, said buildings that were very wasteful have the biggest opportunity to cut emissions through simple fixes such as insulating exposed heating pipes, tuning their boilers, operating their HVAC systems properly, or switching to LED light bulbs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really basic stuff that they should have already been doing,\u201d Sikora said. \u201cIn many buildings, people don\u2019t do it because inertia takes over and you just run the building like you always have. It\u2019s human nature. But the law gives them a kick in the pants to get this done.\u201d\n\nFor that reason, Sikora said the city\u2019s findings didn\u2019t strike him as a big surprise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fair, pretty easily achievable initial limit, so it makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a part of me that\u2019s breathing a little easier. On this present trend, the law will be a spectacular success.\u201d\n\nJohn Mandyck, CEO of the Urban Green Council, agreed, saying the new findings show that \u201cLocal Law 97 is working. It\u2019s sending a market signal and the market hears it.\u201d\n\nDisadvantaged Communities\n-------------------------\n\nAggarwala expressed dismay that many of the buildings that aren\u2019t in compliance are in disadvantaged communities.\n\nFines under Local Law 97 could be ruinous to middle- and low-income tenants, because the costs may be passed down in the form of increased rents and other fees, according to Geoffrey Mazel, a board member and an attorney with Homeowners for a Stronger New York.\n\nBut Local Law 97 contains provisions for buildings that are making a good faith effort to comply, and City Hall under Mayor Eric Adams (D) is now developing rules on how those efforts will be assessed. Those draft regulations are expected within \u201ca few weeks,\u201d Aggarwala said.\n\nHe also said most of the buildings that are out of compliance are only short by 10% to 20% of their goals. The emissions caps vary across 60 property types, as well as a given building\u2019s size.\n\nBut many more buildings are out of compliance with the next set of reduction targets that start in 2030, \u201cso they have much more difficult, much more expensive, deep retrofits that they will have to do,\u201d Aggarwala said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, some of those do not pay for themselves.\u201d\n\nOpposition From Real Estate\n---------------------------\n\nThe law has come under fire from the city\u2019s real estate sector and Republican lawmakers, who have consistently said many buildings will struggle to comply, often echoing Aggarwala\u2019s observation about buildings in disadvantaged communities.\n\nTo help buildings facing stiff fines, city council member Vickie Paladino (R) recently introduced a [bill](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6013724&GUID=E923FF1B-E248-43E4-85E6-56E7F95A2046) that would delay the financial penalties by seven years.\n\nThe powerful Real Estate Board of New York said in January that fines on property owners could exceed $900 million each year by 2030. \n\nZach Steinberg, senior vice president of policy at REBNY, said the group is encouraged that more building owners are taking steps to reduce emissions, but that it also wants to review the city\u2019s data before the fines start kicking in. \n\n\u201cWith financial penalties on the horizon for many buildings next year and tens of thousand more in 2030, we look forward to reviewing the City\u2019s data as we work to effectively fulfill the goals of Local Law 97,\u201d he said.\n\nA handful of other cities have building performance laws on the books, but New York stands alone because of the number of buildings it contains. More than two thirds of the city\u2019s 56.5 million tons of annual carbon emissions come from its buildings sector, mostly linked to lighting, heating, cooling, and appliance usage.\n\n\u201cYou can fix any building\u2014it\u2019s a matter of how much money you want to deploy to get that building up to code,\u201d said Adam Kramer, CEO of nZero, a software company that has been working with New York property owners to understand their Local Law 97 compliance obligations. \u201cIn some cases it\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult because you\u2019re not looking at just one thing.\u201d\n\nOne concern for local Democratic officials and their allies in the environmental world is that the Adams administration may weaken the law when his administration issues the next set of implementing regulations.\n\nThe law gives Adams some discretion to relax penalties, although he could also face legal challenges from environmentalists if he attempted that. The mayor doesn\u2019t have the authority to alter Local Law 97\u2019s formula for calculating penalties.\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "11% of New York's buildings aren't on track to meet the requirements of Local Law 97, according to a preliminary review by the city's Department of Buildings.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Noncompliance with the law"}, {"summary": "Buildings complying with the law attribute their progress to retrofit work, sustainability upgrades, and a city-run accelerator program that advises buildings on becoming more energy efficient.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Buildings are finding the resources and technologies to come into compliance."}, {"summary": "Buildings that were wasteful have the biggest opportunity to cut emissions through simple fixes such as insulating heating pipes, tuning boilers, operating HVAC systems properly, or switching to LED light bulbs.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Buildings can make basic fixes to comply with the law."}, {"summary": "The law contains provisions for buildings making a good faith effort to comply, but many buildings are out of compliance with the next set of reduction targets starting in 2030.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Some buildings are short of their goals but making an effort, while others are out of compliance with future targets."}, {"summary": "Opposition to the law comes from the real estate sector and Republican lawmakers who argue that many buildings will struggle to comply.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Opposition from real estate sector and questioning the feasibility of compliance."}, {"summary": "New York City's buildings sector is responsible for over two-thirds of the city's annual carbon emissions.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Buildings sector is a significant contributor to carbon emissions."}, {"summary": "There are concerns that the Adams administration may weaken the law when issuing the next set of implementing regulations.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Concerns about potential weakening of the law by the administration."}], "semantic_commentary": "Buildings' non-compliance hinders emission reduction, further challenges expected.", "sentiment_score": -0.2857142857142857, "classifications": null}, {"source": "TechRepublic", "link": "https://www.techrepublic.com/article/tech-takes-diverse-approaches-sustainability-including-net-zero-carbon/", "title": "Tech Takes Diverse Approaches to Sustainability Including Net Zero Carbon by 2030", "content": "\n![A balance of CO2 and a leaf on top of a globe.](https://www.techrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tr-2023-08-16-Hero.Sustainability-770x448.jpeg)Image: blacksalmon/Adobe Stock\nParse away, but dire climate news on the potential of the world to [breach a 1.5c temperature increase threshold](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/17/global-heating-climate-crisis-record-temperatures-wmo-research) by 2027.

Check out how** [**semiconductor makers**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/deloitte-semiconductors-sustainability/) **are going beyond carbon offsets (TechRepublic)**\n\n\nCarbon free, a more challenging proposition, means directly reducing emissions to zero. \u201cFor example, if a country or company is carbon-free, all the energy and electricity comes from renewable sources, like wind or solar,\u201d the group said, noting that Washington, California, New Mexico and Hawaii have carbon-free targets in place requiring 100% clean or renewable electricity.\n\n\n### Carbon negative\n\n\n\n### More about Innovation\n\n\n* [ChatGPT cheat sheet: Complete guide for 2023](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/chatgpt-cheat-sheet/)\n* [GPT-4 cheat sheet: What is GPT-4, and what is it capable of?](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/gpt-4-cheat-sheet/)\n* [7 Best AI Art Generators of 2023](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/best-ai-art-generators/)\n* [Hiring kit: Prompt engineer](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/hiring-kit-prompt-engineer/)\n\n\n\nHow about carbon negative, which companies like [Microsoft](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/un-global-climate-action-awards/climate-neutral-now/microsoft-carbon-negative-goal) have committed to? Carbon offset company [Terrapass](https://terrapass.com/) explained in a blog that a carbon negative would mean, in theory, emitting less than zero carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) greenhouse gasses. \u201cSince it is impossible to emit a negative amount of carbon (or any other physical substance), being carbon negative refers to the net emissions you create. To be carbon negative means to offset more carbon, through carbon capture, sequestration or avoidance, than you contribute to the environment.\u201d\n\n\n### Scope 1,2, 3 carbon emission schedule\n\n\nMany companies, tech and otherwise, adopted carbon-reduction targets based on the [Scope 1, 2 and 3](https://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/greenhouse-gases-epa) carbon emission schedule (**Figure B**) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

He added, \u201cThese are key projects Google is including in its calculation of how to reduce their carbon emissions.\u201d\n\n\nMicrosoft launched Cloud for Sustainability, cut operational emissions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMicrosoft, which set its first carbon emission goals in 2009 and was carbon neutral in 2012, committed in 2020 to being [carbon negative by 2030](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/). They said that by 2030 it will remove more carbon than it emits, \u201cSetting us on a path to remove by 2050 all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded.\u201d\n\n\nThe company said its [Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability/cloud) helps users take such actions as:\n\n\n* Unify their data intelligence around Scope 1, 2 and 3 energy use goals.\n* Build a sustainable IT infrastructure.\n* Create green end-to-end value chains.\n* Meet other environmental, social and governance goals.\n* Innovate around resilience and other sustainable business models.\n\n\nIn [Microsoft\u2019s most recent environmental sustainability report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report), the company said that In 2022, when business grew by 18%, its overall emissions declined by 0.5%. This is in part because of a 22.7% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 (operational) emissions.\n\n\nApple is using its Daisy robot to turn phones to dust\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nApple, which has [committed to being carbon neutral by 2030](https://www.apple.com/environment/), has been using technological innovations such as its [Daisy](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apple-expands-the-use-of-recycled-materials-across-its-products/) robot to recycle basic materials.In April 2023, [Apple reported progress on its climate goals](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/04/apple-announces-major-progress-toward-climate-goals-ahead-of-earth-day/), which included:\n\n\n* It had decreased its carbon footprint by over 45% since 2015.\n* It had directed over 40,000 metric tons of electronic scrap toward recycling.\n* 20% of all materials shipped in its products came from recycled sources. Apple said the majority of aluminum in its products are recycled, and that it employs a new, zero-carbon smelting process.\n\n\n\u201cApple is one of the most aggressive companies in the world in terms of reclaiming minerals,\u201d said Grant. \u201cHowever, while they are using their Daisy robots to grind up phones to reclaim the component materials, there are numerous regulations preventing e-waste from being moved across borders. So the collection and delivery of materials is proving very difficult,\u201d he said. This year, [Apple pledged to use 100% recycled cobalt batteries by 2025](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/04/apple-will-use-100-percent-recycled-cobalt-in-batteries-by-2025/).\n\n\n**SEE:** [**Sustainable solutions**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/tech-impact-reduce-single-use-plastics/) **for tacking plastic waste (TechRepublic)**\n\n\nCloud and security firms looking to greener processes\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMost cloud, software-as-a-service and security firms are looking at ways to reduce their hardware and server farm footprints through renewable sources of energy and recycling plans, partnerships and consumer programs. Below we focus on efforts from Cisco, Akamai, WithSecure and Gigamon.\n\n\n### Cisco aims for net zero by 2040\n\n\nIn 2021, [Cisco announced its goal to be net zero by 2040](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/csr/environmental-sustainability/net-zero.html), including products, operations and supply chain. The company\u2019s plan aligns with Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions targets, using 2019 as a benchmark.\n\n\nThe company is aiming for:\n\n\n* 90% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse emissions by 2025. Cisco said it would neutralize any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere.\n* 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution and use of sold products by 2030.\n* Net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2040.\n\n\n### Akamai aims for 100% renewable energy and waste recycling\n\n\nIn 2021, cloud services and web security company Akamai Technologies said 50% of its energy needs had already been met by renewable sources. [Akamai also announced 2030 sustainability goals](https://www.akamai.com/newsroom/press-release/akamai-announces-new-2030-sustainability-goals) toward 100% renewable energy at data centers, offices, network program partners and other sources of electricity, and said it will use \u201cattestable and traceable sources of renewable energy certificates\u201d to reach them.\n\n\nOne focus is on efficiency of its edge platform, which Akamai characterized as its greatest point of energy consumption, comprising approximately 325,000 servers in more than 135 countries and nearly 1,435 networks around the world as of 2021. In addition, Akamai announced a global expansion of its 100% electronic waste recycling program.\n\n\n### WithSecure launches W/Sustainability initiative\n\n\nEarlier this year, threat intelligence and response firm WithSecure launched [W/Sustainability](https://www.withsecure.com/en/about-us/corporate-responsibility), designed to make sustainability and transparency part of its strategy and operations, including a green coding initiative to lower energy consumed by software.\n\n\n### Gigamon creates power savings calculator\n\n\n[Gigamon recently launched an Energy Savings Calculator](https://blog.gigamon.com/2023/05/16/put-your-carbonivore-data-center-on-a-diet/) as part of its [Network Efficiency Appraisal Team](https://go.gigamon.com/NEAT) to get customers to cut power consumption, carbon footprint and costs associated with data centers by as much as 87% over five years. The calculator looks at the volume of network traffic sent to tools and the annual growth rate in network traffic to see where energy efficiencies are achievable.\n\n\nAre ecommerce and cloud services like eBay and AWS inherently sustainable?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGrant asserted that the business models of ecommerce and cloud services companies like eBay and AWS are inherently green because they are marketing their spare capacity. He said, for example, that Amazon\u2019s web service came about because the company was sitting on huge unused capacity, and therefore unnecessary energy costs on unused service.\n\n\n\u201cAWS was invented, to some extent, because they needed so much capacity at peak moments that they were not using 80% of their service at other times,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, renting some of that spare capacity out to people that didn\u2019t have the same peaks that they did made a lot of sense. And that is actually a sustainability business model \u2014 it\u2019s like a service economy rental that takes some amount of physical resources and passes it around. So, if I were counting Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint, I\u2019d put a big tick in the margin for that on the positive side. It\u2019s a commercial and sustainable win-win.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.techrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trnls-nextbigthing-270x170.jpeg) \n\n\n### Subscribe to the Innovation Insider Newsletter\n\n\nCatch up on the latest tech innovations that are changing the world, including IoT, 5G, the latest about phones, security, smart cities, AI, robotics, and more.\n\n\nDelivered Tuesdays and Fridays\n\n\n[Sign up today](https://www.techrepublic.com/sign-up/) \n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Dire climate news on the potential of the world to breach a 1.5c temperature increase threshold by 2027.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Climate news is negative."}, {"summary": "Tech companies are addressing their carbon footprint and investing in sustainability efforts.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Tech companies are taking steps to address their carbon footprint, which is positive."}, {"summary": "Data centers and transmission networks account for up to 3% of global electricity and greenhouse gas emissions.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Neutral information about the impact of data centers on emissions."}, {"summary": "Google aims to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030 and invest in carbon removal solutions.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Google's efforts to operate on carbon-free energy and invest in carbon removal solutions are positive."}, {"summary": "Microsoft aims to be carbon negative by 2030 and has launched Cloud for Sustainability.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Microsoft's commitment to being carbon negative and launching Cloud for Sustainability is positive."}, {"summary": "Apple is using the Daisy robot to recycle materials and has made progress towards its carbon neutrality goals.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Apple's use of the Daisy robot and progress towards carbon neutrality goals is positive."}, {"summary": "Cisco aims to be net zero by 2040 and reduce greenhouse emissions.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Cisco's goal of being net zero and reducing greenhouse emissions is positive."}, {"summary": "Akamai aims for 100% renewable energy and waste recycling.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Akamai's goal of 100% renewable energy and waste recycling is positive."}, {"summary": "WithSecure and Gigamon have implemented sustainability initiatives to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Sustainability initiatives by WithSecure and Gigamon to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint are positive."}, {"summary": "The business models of ecommerce and cloud services like eBay and AWS are seen as inherently sustainable.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The business models of ecommerce and cloud services are seen as inherently sustainable."}], "semantic_commentary": "Insight: Tech companies are investing in sustainability efforts.", "sentiment_score": 0.7, "classifications": [{"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, specifically the dire climate news and the efforts of tech companies to address their carbon footprint."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions tech companies committing to reducing their carbon footprint and investing in sustainability efforts."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions companies investing in carbon removal solutions and implementing sustainability initiatives to reduce carbon footprint."}]}, {"source": "The Good Men Project", "link": "https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/genetically-engineered-trees-stoke-climate-hope-and-environmental-fears/", "title": "Genetically Engineered Trees Stoke Climate Hope \u2014 And Environmental Fears - The Good Men Project", "content": "\n\n* *U.S. climate technology startup Living Carbon has been developing genetically engineered poplar trees that it says can absorb more carbon \u2013 a potential tool in the climate crisis.*\n* *Some experts say the company lacks long-term field data and is rushing to commercialize its \u201csupertrees,\u201d potentially putting other species at risk.*\n* *Despite such concerns, Living Carbon is going ahead and planting mixed forests that include its GE trees, funded by carbon offsets.*\n\n\n\n\u201cO poplar tree, O poplar tree, how carbon-dense are thy branches \u2026\u201d\n\n\nTrees are a major tool in our fight against climate change by sucking up carbon dioxide, but one company is taking them a step further: genetically engineering trees to sequester even more carbon. U.S. climate technology startup Living Carbon is developing genetically engineered seedlings of a hybrid poplar that it says can accumulate up to 53% more biomass than control plants and thereby absorb 27% more carbon.\n\n\nPlants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugar, a process known as photosynthesis. Living Carbon says its trees, a hybrid of the common aspen (*Populus tremula*) and white poplar (*P. alba*), can do it better with genetic changes to boost its photosynthetic performance.\n\n\nThis solution emphasizes the potential role of synthetic biology in climate adaptation and carbon removal, and while the tweaking of trees\u2019 genome has many proponents, not everyone is convinced. Critics warn these GE trees could lead to environmental damage and spread outside of plantation areas.\n\n\n### **Sucking carbon, slowing decay**\n\n\nFounded in 2019, Living Carbon has started strong. After collecting $15 million in seed fundingA and receiving a $500,000 grant from the U.S. government in 2021, the San Francisco-based group raised $21 million, pledging to capture\u00a0[604 million metric tons of CO2](https://www.livingcarbon.com/post/a-tree-shaped-bat-signal)\u00a0\u2014 or 1.7% of 2021 global annual emissions \u2014 from 2023 to 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Player is loading.Play VideoPlayUnmuteCurrent Time\u00a00:00/Duration\u00a0-:-Loaded: 0%0:00Stream Type\u00a0LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time\u00a0--:-\u00a01xPlayback RateChapters* Chapters\nDescriptions* descriptions off, selected\nCaptions* captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n* captions off, selected\nAudio TrackPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

The group, which said it had seen a\u00a0[97% survival rate](https://www.livingcarbon.com/post/a-tree-shaped-bat-signal)\u00a0of its seedlings on its abandoned mine planting projects, plans to have more than 4 million seedlings in the ground by early 2024.\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that biotechnology can have integrative and restorative effects on ecosystems when practiced with intentions other than maximizing crop yield within a monoculture,\u201d Hall said.\n\n\nBut experts are questioning the ability of these \u201csupertrees\u201d to live up to their promises without damaging surrounding ecosystems.\n\n\n### **\u2018Over-the-top hype\u2019?**\n\n\nIn September, organizations with the Campaign to STOP GE Trees said in a\u00a0[report](https://stopgetrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Global-Status-of-Genetically-Engineered-Tree-Development-EN.pdf)\u00a0that the only scientific study discussing Living Carbon\u2019s research was the company\u2019s own white paper, which was not initially peer-reviewed. The critics also said the company had failed to show that its GE trees could continue to grow at an increased rate throughout their lifetime.\n\n\n\u201cWe initially published our white paper on [biology preprints server] bioRxiv because we wanted to make the research available to everyone at the time the company launched publicly,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThe paper has since been peer-reviewed and published in a special edition of\u00a0[*Forests*](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/4/827).\u201d\n\n\nAnne Petermann, the campaign coordinator and director of the Global Justice Ecology Project (GJEP), says she continues to have strong reservations about the project.\n\n\n\u201cBesides my concerns about their nonchalant attitude about changing the evolutionary trajectory of trees, I have found their hype to be a bit over-the-top,\u201d she wrote to Mongabay, adding that even one of Living Carbon\u2019s key partners was \u201c[uncomfortable](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/08/1074287/inside-the-quest-to-engineer-climate-saving-super-trees/).\u201d\n\n\nCiting molecular geneticist Ricarda Steinbrecher, Petermann said genetic engineering could create numerous unexpected effects, including mutations and alterations in the genome of GE trees \u201cthat happen not just at the moment of transformation, but over time, and not just to the organism itself, but potentially to progeny.\u201d\n\n\nBut Hall said Living Carbon\u2019s poplars would be unable to produce pollen \u2014 since all the GE trees are female.\n\n\nHowever, even if that did occur, she said, \u201cthe risks would be limited to a localized increase in accumulation of biomass,\u201d because the other tree species planted by the company aren\u2019t closely related enough to fertilize the GE trees.\n\n\nPetermann noted that poplars, especially, can reproduce vegetatively and resprout from the stump as well: \u201cThey will eventually cross national or tribal boundaries.\u201d\n\n\nHighlighting a growing flow of information about \u201cthe critical importance of fungal pathways in forest soils in facilitating communication between and among trees, not to mention in storing carbon in forest soils and providing nutrients to other trees,\u201d she said Living Carbon\u2019s \u201csupertrees\u201d could have an evolutionary advantage over non-GE poplars \u2014 such as the ability to reach sunlight faster.\n\n\n\u201cRot-resistant trees disrupt the natural cycle in ways that are not understood at all,\u201d Petermann said.\n\n\n\u201cThis is especially problematic in an organism like a tree that lives or can live for such a long time and interacts with so many other organisms,\u201d she added, emphasizing the need for field trials that last decades and cover several generations of trees.\n\n\n### **USDA\u2019s green light raises red flag**\n\n\nLiving Carbon has begun\u00a0[commercial pilot planting](https://www.livingcarbon.com/post/our-learnings-from-bringing-the-first-climate-smart-seedlings-to-us-markets)\u00a0to assess the performance of its seedlings \u201cin scenarios more akin to real-world planting,\u201d Hall said. Living Carbon isn\u2019t planting a monoculture, but mixed forests, with a total of 12 species included in its carbon project plantings so far. To date, it has planted around 8,900 photosynthesis-enhanced hybrid poplar trees among mixed plantings in the states of Georgia and Ohio. GE trees make up for about 5% of their plantings.\n\nDon\u2019t like ads? [Become a supporter](/registration/) and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\nBut this debunks the company\u2019s claims, according to Petermann: \u201cHow can they possibly claim to be able to confidently store and measure [carbon] if their \u201853% faster growing trees\u2019 are only one part of a matrix of trees?\u201d\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently concluded that these \u201csupertrees\u201d did not need to be regulated as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and could be commercially planted.\n\n\nYet, for Petermann, the agency gave Living Carbon\u2019s trees a pass under \u201cextremely arcane\u201d rules developed in the 1980s to address whether a GMO plant may be a \u201cplant pest risk.\u201d Living Carbon uses a different technology that the USDA hasn\u2019t evaluated, she said: the \u201cgene gun\u201d method, which fires microscopic \u201cbullets\u201d coated with genetic material into the cells.\n\n\n\u201cThe result is the same: new genes are introduced into the DNA with all of the associated damage to the genome \u2026 and all of the unpredictable impacts that it will cause,\u201d Petermann said. \u201cIt is not that the USDA thought these trees were safe; they just said that they were outside of their mandate.\u201d\n\n\nBy contrast, a similar genetic-engineering effort, to impart blight resistance to the American chestnut tree (*Castanea dentata*), a species decimated by a pest fungus, has been awaiting approval for release since 2020.\n\n\n### **Selling carbon credits, or treading warily**\n\n\nTo fund its projects, Living Carbon sells carbon credits to entities eager to offset emissions valued on the carbon that its trees will potentially suck up.\n\n\nAccording to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the voluntary carbon market could be worth up to $40 billion by 2030, up from $2 billion in 2021. But carbon offsets have recently sparked concerns around their lack of transparency, potential adverse impacts on local communities, or the fact that they may give polluters a license to emit.\n\n\n\u201cWe have forward agreements for carbon credits that will be delivered in 2024 and 2025,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThis is standard practice in carbon removal and renewables and necessary to obtain project financing.\u201d\n\n\nShe added the majority of sales were directly negotiated with corporate buyers, while some were made through platforms like Watershed or Patch.\n\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of submitting some of our projects for verification with the American Carbon Registry [ACR], and exploring next-generation methodologies such as [nonprofit organization] BCarbon that may be a better fit for future projects,\u201d Hall said.\n\n\nFor Petermann, the \u201ccarbon credits, which they first said were verified by Verra \u2026 raise more flags.\u201d A recent\u00a0[investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe)\u00a0into the world\u2019s leading carbon standard found that more than 90% of Verra\u2019s rainforest offset credits were likely worthless.\n\n\n\u201cThis makes Living Carbon\u2019s sales pitch doubly troubling,\u201d Petermann added. \u201cThere is no upside that I can see.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t like ads?

Moreover, their lack of genetic diversity may weaken them in the face of environmental challenges like climate change.\n\n\nIn addition, Chazdon said that \u201ctrees engineered to grow quickly have low wood density and short life spans in general, so the overall amount of carbon stored is low, particularly if they are harvested after a few years.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn the end, you will not get a forest out of it either, so the potential for multiple benefits \u2014 biodiversity, income generation for local people, use of trees for food or firewood \u2014 will not be possible,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are many [other] effective solutions that can be adopted along with decarbonizing energy sources.\u201d\n\n\nBill Laurance, a research professor at James Cook University in Australia, said the world tends to get \u201coverly freaked out\u201d about GE organisms.\n\n\n\u201cPlaying God is risky, but humans have actually been doing it for thousands of years,\u201d he wrote in an email to Mongabay, while adding that \u201cecological engineering\u201d approaches can be prohibitively expensive and only have modest benefits.\n\n\nBut, he said, \u201cAs a group, trees capture and store more carbon than any other type of organism, so I think it\u2019s reasonable to focus on trees as a potential means to reduce atmospheric carbon levels.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not a one-size-fits-all tool, but trees are definitely going to be part of any viable climate solution,\u201d Laurance said.\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nThis post was [previously published on news.mongabay.com](https://news.mongabay.com/2023/07/genetically-engineered-trees-stoke-climate-hope-and-environmental-fears/)\u00a0and under a [Creative Commons license CC BY-ND 4.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20470%20103'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Escape-from-the-Man-Box-Premium-Member.jpg)](https://goodmenproject.com/premium/)\n\n\n### If you believe in the work we are doing here at The Good Men Project and want a deeper connection with our community, please join us as a Premium Member today.\n\n\nPremium Members get to view The Good Men Project with NO ADS.

Republicans lament its cost, while some green groups discount the IRA's potency as long as oil is drilled. \n\n\n\n This week marks one year since the Biden White House and congressional Democrats maneuvered the Inflation Reduction Act into law in a narrowly divided Washington. \n\n\n\n The IRA is a broad federal spending initiative with a name that gives little clue to what's inside -- pages loaded with climate-minded energy incentives and tax savings for businesses and individuals. Still, its passage, following an infrastructure bill that sent money to widening the electric-vehicle charging network, earned President Biden a reputation as a \"climate president\" on the global stage, vital for a global issue like climate change. \n\n\n\n Even one year in, the IRA's ongoing tweaks and stretched out implementation leave some Americans wondering just how tax sweeteners for electric vehicles, solar, heat pumps and more, actually work. \n\n\n\n Republicans, for their part, see the anniversary as an opportunity to promote a different plan. Namely, greater U.S. energy independence, replete with domestic oil and natural gas production alongside private-sector growth for wind, solar, nuclear and hydrogen. The GOP is primed to slash the IRA's green spending should they win a 2024 majority. \n\n\n\n Proponents of the IRA cheer the roughly $360 billion --$121 billion in direct spending and $235 billion in tax credits -- in government initiatives meant to speed the energy transition away from oil, including from gas vehicles to EVs(RIVN), as well as federal money meant keep fossil-fuel companies (XOM)(CVX) in business during the transition to more renewables by pumping investment into carbon-capture technology. Carbon capture includes approaches that can grab Earth-warming carbon dioxide and other emissions at the point of fossil-fuel combustion, before they reach the atmosphere, and another, direct-capture, solution that sucks existing CO2 from the sky. \n\n\n\n Related:Climate change and carbon capture: Texas, Louisiana score federal money for largest-ever U.S. direct-air effort \n\n\n\n \"I just visited some of the electric vehicle, solar panel and battery factories popping up throughout the country, and I can tell you definitively we're in the middle of an American economic revolution like we haven't seen in generations, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies,\" said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, which bills itself as a nonpartisan business group that sees environmental and economic benefits from an energy transition. \n\n\n\n \"With the economic costs of climate change rising like a thermometer in July, this made-in-America clean energy boom couldn't come at a better time,\" Keefe said. \n\n\n\n Research by E2 has tracked 210 IRA-linked clean energy and clean vehicle projects that would invest a cumulative $86 billion into the communities that host them, creating 74,000 new jobs across 39 states. \n\n\n\n Read:Biden points to Arizona's extreme heat, majestic Grand Canyon as he promotes climate-focused 2022 law \n\n\n\n Most IRA backers are perhaps loudest about its long life -- many of the tax incentives are written to last for years. \n\n\n\n \"What's really important about the IRA is it's not a limited-time-only offer that people have to hurry up and go out and get. It's available for the next 10 years,\" said Ari Matusiak, CEO of Rewiring America, which continues to expand a calculator built to tell renters and homeowners how much energy savings and climate impact they can have by tapping IRA incentives. \n\n\n\n The calculator takes into account the U.S.'s some 125 million households and 550,000 building types. Plus, the nonprofit will roll out training courses to empower consumers as new energy-economy experts who might convince their neighbors to join the transition. The Internal Revenue Service has its own guidance for taxpayers on all credits and deductions from the IRA. \n\n\n\n \"People don't really need to explicitly understand how all of the incentives work and how they're built into the law,\" Matusiak said. \"They just need to know how to access them.\" \n\n\n\n Here's a look at some of the consumer energy incentives and economic sectors that most observers consider IRA \"winners.\" And, the parts of the law singled out by critics as the \"losers,\" such as features still evolving or that some groups believe missed the mark. \n\n\n\n IRA money put to work \n\n\n\n Private-sector assessment says the IRA's government spending is mosly pro-growth. \n\n\n\n Moody's published a report on its expectation for the IRA's roughly $400 billion in climate provisions, coupled with related provisions in the $280 billion CHIPS Act and the $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to \"stimulate significant investment in U.S. clean energy technologies and manufacturing over the next decade, with positive ramifications for growth, productivity and innovation.\" \n\n\n\n And the growth is already tangible. \n\n\n\n \"There have been signs that the legislation is contributing to a surge in clean energy manufacturing and related industries such as semiconductors, and factoring into companies' investment decisions, including in the auto, utilitiesXLU and oil and gas sectors,\" Moody's authors say in the report. \n\n\n\n \"It goes to show why smart companies and investors long sought this kind of federal climate investment: not only will it lower the risk of dangerous pollution and climate disasters that present immense risk to our economy, but it provides a robust foundation to grow the U.S. economy for decades to come,\" said Anne Kelly, vice president of government relations at sustainable-investing advocate Ceres. \n\n\n\n Companies are meant to leverage federal incentives to attract their own capital. \n\n\n\n That's true for Boston Metal, which will build a plant in West Virginia that will manufacture essential components for the company's green steel production platform called Molten Oxide Electrolysis (MOE). The plant will produce low-emissions refractory metal alloys and high-purity chromium alloys, of which the U.S. currently has zero production capacity. More than two-thirds of global supply is from China and Russia. \n\n\n\n \"The IRA has created tailwinds for Boston Metal's efforts to decarbonize the steel industry,\" said Boston Metal CEO Tadeu Carneiro. \"Not only will the IRA help secure access to reliable and affordable clean electricity that our MOE technology requires, it will incentivize steel producers to deploy decarbonization technologies and create more market demand for green steel across industries.\" \n\n\n\n Tax-focused consumer savings \n\n\n\n As for consumers, the IRA offers rebates that cover a substantial portion, if not the entire cost, of purchasing and installing energy-efficient appliances. Electric heat pumps, water heaters, clothes dryers and ovens are just a few examples. For instance, a taxpayer may be eligible for rebates of up to $2,000 to replace a furnace or air conditioner with an electric heat pump, providing more efficient heating and cooling. \n\n\n\n Check out the 25C tax credit for steps from upgrading your HVAC or insulation. Click here to see if your home qualifies \n\n\n\n But the entirety of the IRA tax incentives has been slow to roll out, in part because the federal law empowers each state to control some of the rebates. In some cases, that requires building out point-of-purchase screening to make sure only qualifying taxpayers receive the breaks. \n\n\n\n Rewiring America, which says more than 800,000 households have visited its energy-efficiency calculator and education site, tells consumers to watch for more details on rebates come fall into winter. \n\n\n\n Certainly, advocates see room for the IRA to expand, they've said, including refundability of tax credits within the 25C for those whose low income means they don't pay taxes. \n\n\n\n An uptick in EV purchases \n\n\n\n For some interested buyers, the IRA presents a prime opportunity for substantial savings when purchasing or leasing electric vehicles (EVs). \n\n\n\n Qualified buyers can save up to $7,500 on select new EVs or $4,000 on a used one, with pre-owned inclusion new in the IRA. Vehicle price, buyer income and percentage of U.S. manufacturing by model all matter. Check eligibility here. \n\n\n\n There are widening long-term benefits of EV ownership, especially when coupled with IRA-sweetened renewable energy sources like solar power. Charging your vehicle at home using clean energy can further reduce your carbon footprint and increase cost savings. \n\n\n\n A Bank of America report says, gas-engine vehicle \"dominance is over,\" with electric cars expected to account for a larger portion of new model launches from 2024 to 2027 -- 46% EV vs. 35% internal-combustion engine and another 18% hybrid. \n\n\n\n The Biden administration has also used climate-linked incentives to push Tesla(TSLA) and the broader auto sector to open up the EV charging network as a stipulation of earning federal dollars. \n\n\n\n Read: Tesla unlocks EV network. What's next in push to make chargers 'as easy as filling with gas' \n\n\n\n And:GM, Hyundai and other car manufacturers to build 30,000 fast EV chargers in challenge to Tesla \n\n\n\n Solar's time to shine? \n\n\n\n The law includes a solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) that enables American taxpayers to receive a credit worth 30% of the cost of their solar system until 2032. \n\n\n\n It also includes a new ITC worth 30% of the cost of a home battery storage system, making solar-powered battery storage for non-sunny use more affordable too. Finally, the IRA solar ITC is available to both single-family and multifamily homes, which means benefits accessible to both homeowners, and if property owners participate, to renters. \n\n\n\n \"Not only were solar incentives expanded, but they were extended for a long time,\" said Suzanne Leta, head of policy and strategy with solar-panel installer and financing provider SunPower. \n\n\n\n \"And now the single most important thing, in my opinion, is to just make sure more people know about the IRA,\" Leta said, referencing a SunPower survey of consumers. \n\n\n\n (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n\n\n 08-16-23 1017ET\n\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a federal spending initiative that includes climate-minded energy incentives and tax savings for businesses and individuals.

IRA\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Democrats have hailed the law as climate-game changer, but it\u2019s popularity with companies is proving expensive as it speeds the transition to clean energy economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![President Joe Biden

President Joe Biden said Tuesday during an IRA-related appearance in Milwaukee. | Morry Gash/AP Photo\n\n\n\n\n\nBy [Kelsey Tamborrino](https://www.politico.com/staff/kelsey-tamborrino)\n\n\n08/16/2023 06:04 PM EDT\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* + Link Copied\n* + \n\t+ \n\t+\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law one year ago Wednesday counts as his crowning legislative achievement: an economic stimulus package designed to put the U.S. at the forefront of the fight against climate change. \n\n\nPolls show that Biden is [struggling to get voters\u2019 attention](https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2023/08/04/july-13-23-2023-washington-post-university-maryland-climate-poll/) for his signature law, and the anniversary is competing with headlines about record-high temperatures, deadly wildfires and other dire climate news from around the globe. But Biden and other Democrats have mostly leaned into an economic message as they [fan out across the country](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/06/biden-mtgs-backyard-00105000) to sell the public on the IRA, which has drawn at least $270 billion in private sector investments for technology such as wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implications of the law are huge \u2014 with major questions remaining about its ultimate price tag, the swift transformation it\u2019s pushing for the nation\u2019s energy markets, and its ability to lessen the pollution that\u2019s warming the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are three big things to watch as the United States\u2019 largest-ever climate law turns 1:\n\n### **It\u2019s proving more expensive than advertised**\n\n[Estimates based on the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s official score](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-scores-ira-238-billion-deficit-reduction) last year put the cost of the law\u2019s climate and energy provisions at about $391 billion over the decade between 2022 and 2031. But other analyses since then have put that figure much higher, including [a Goldman Sachs estimate](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/the-us-is-poised-for-an-energy-revolution.html) that said it would total closer to $1.2 trillion. \n\nThe increased figures are due in part to the fact that the law doesn\u2019t cap many of its tax incentives and interest in taking advantage of those credits has been high. Analysts also cite implementation guidance coming out of the Treasury Department that has widened the variety of electric vehicles and other products that qualify for the law\u2019s incentives.\n\nWhite House senior adviser John Podesta suggested Wednesday those increased estimates indicate greater interest in the tax credits than initially anticipated last summer. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good news story. That means that people are investing in America,\u201d Podesta said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting people to work. We\u2019re bringing supply chains home. And overall in the mid- and long-term, this bill ... is reducing the deficit.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have seized on the newer estimates to accuse Democrats of downplaying the law\u2019s true cost, and to argue that wealthy individuals and big corporations will gain most of the benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act was a complete boondoggle,\u201d said Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.). Rather than reduce inflation, he added, the law \u201cwas a giveaway to the leftwing agenda \u2014 the Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the conservative American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said there\u2019s \u201cno question\u201d the energy provisions will come at a bigger cost to the taxpayers than initially thought.\n\n\u201cYou could have done just as much good cheaper,\u201d he said, noting that the IRA provides subsidies for both power sources and for technologies \u2014 such as electric vehicles \u2014 that will use the power. \u201cThey\u2019re not coordinated in any way, so they can be really expensive in the end.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the law\u2019s energy provisions counter that the increasing estimates are proof that the IRA is working as intended to attract private sector investment and spur a transition to a clean energy. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generated more investment than even CBO anticipated,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.). \u201cIt\u2019s really unlocked a tremendous amount of capital for battery plants, for electric vehicles, for clean hydrogen, for solar, for offshore wind.\u201d\n\nOne [Credit Suisse estimate](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/news-and-expertise/us-inflation-reduction-act-a-catalyst-for-climate-action-202211.html) from earlier this year put total federal climate spending under the law at more than $800 billion, which in turn would spur $1.7 trillion in public and private spending over the next decade. \n\n### It\u2019s super charging an energy transition\n\nThe U.S. has spent decades moving away from fossil fuels. That pace has sped up since the Inflation Reduction Act became law.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to look back at what\u2019s happening right now, in a few years, and everybody will know that this is an inflection point,\u201d said Bob Keefe, executive director of the national clean energy business group E2. \u201cThis is a defining moment in the American economy that\u2019s going to change it forever.\u201d\n\nSupporters credit the fact that the law has locked in long-term incentives for both businesses and households to switch to cleaner energy \u2014 in place of a previous hodgepodge of tax breaks that used to phase out every few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MOST READ\n----------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![1594393031](https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/b87be6c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2097x1398+0+0/resize/630x420!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F41%2Fa9%2F529b3ecf45d28958838b0d9bd86a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1594393031 \"1594393031\")](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/16/trump-georgia-pardon-00111503)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Under the IRA, those credits evolved to allow a range of niche technologies such as clean hydrogen, battery storage and geothermal to qualify. Backers also see the law\u2019s shift to technology-neutral tax provisions tied to emissions reductions as transformational.\n\nSenate Finance Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said Congress\u2019 old recurring battles over wind and solar tax credits kept those industries mired in uncertainty. Now, he said in a statement, the IRA will \u201callow the free market to go to work \u2014 no picking winners and losers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from the tidal wave of private investment going into clean energy manufacturing that there was enormous pent-up demand for a tax system that rewarded innovation and reduced emissions,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nThe nation\u2019s solar power output is expected to be nearly 50 percent higher in a decade than it would have been without the IRA, according the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar and wind power, along with the nascent energy storage sector, are projected to triple in size to contribute [40 percent of U.S. electricity](https://cleanpower.org/blog/its-a-big-deal-for-job-growth-and-for-a-clean-energy-future/) by 2030.\n\nThe law also includes under-the-radar provisions intended to make the tax credits more accessible for entities such as nonprofits and Native American tribes, which previously struggled to tap into federal incentives that typically went to utilities and major power developers.\n\nThose provisions alone could launch \u201ca wave of new development,\u201d said Gregory Wetstone, the president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, during an event this week. \n\nThe law is also making the U.S. an attractive market for international investment, with foreign companies making up nearly half of the more than 200 major new clean energy projects announced in the U.S. since Biden signed the IRA, [according to a new](https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUZCSOVdq8AXc-2F7GugUbtYvu0EaEB-2FRXPA1obMOMgwDFQrhVdfUrq25UXKAu9iySPrA-3D-3DjDTB_VhV1aWmK8qR5KjnEW-2Bkf7zblJWS3Se-2Bb-2BWmsC518vYEgvky-2FuyD7mu-2B9xClxpR7v7kh2yeq-2Flzavm2c36cthlHNIsiMPdTKzeQDK9kGHHUF4rMagX3REu3ygXU-2B456EbvurGWrQWdoQSXo4-2BtIEa8Js2XgwZqssNhPH8pTknJ3IaQ-2FOHeCxKwc-2FMRSfxMwLh-2B-2FR7eItq-2FziYczlCLjfyRETANyZDXisYxLN8oRVPoSsqtu49SVlG0n9JtOd127XwrCnLNoH-2FIUdzwAR7zWpGPb3icRQRixQUWJWg-2BRB3K6GI3xvQD2GoiUua0r16TIxYgOMbOV73muBHe1bGPDz45fTpBc92jAdl8OI8iphaars-3D) [report](https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUZCSOVdq8AXc-2F7GugUbtYvu0EaEB-2FRXPA1obMOMgwDFQrhVdfUrq25UXKAu9iySPrA-3D-3D2a8__VhV1aWmK8qR5KjnEW-2Bkf7zblJWS3Se-2Bb-2BWmsC518vYEgvky-2FuyD7mu-2B9xClxpR7v7kh2yeq-2Flzavm2c36cthlHNIsiMPdTKzeQDK9kGHHUF4rMagX3REu3ygXU-2B456EbvurGWrQWdoQSXo4-2BtIEa8Js2XgwZqssNhPH8pTknJ3IaQ-2FOHeCxKwc-2FMRSfxMwLh-2B-2FR7eItq-2FziYczlCLjfyRFmPmWrthWjnxiOQRjwtMYL3xk09h-2FwXqrPRAN44TJEm3cBVgALBu9gr58zVonMjbIxXzSR0CP6qm-2B0Yu-2BtZWY-2BghCMxvZ6HrO-2FG3G60qaqJ-2FYmeQ-2F3I5o0S-2FWL0yiotCyIHaFONUjdCyUbvz0Rfb1s-3D) from E2.\n\nAnother fact with still-unknown political implications: An estimated 60 percent of clean energy investments triggered by the IRA are for [projects in Republican-dominated states and congressional districts](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/13/biden-inflation-reduction-act-climate-states-00110940). Biden has acknowledged that not everyone in his party is happy about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of Democrats are getting mad at me because we\u2019re investing actually more in red states than blue states right now,\u201d the president said Tuesday during an IRA-related appearance in Milwaukee. \u201cBut they\u2019re all Americans. I made a promise no matter where, and folks, red states, blue states, urban, suburban or rural \u2014 all of that will benefit from what we do.\u201d\n\n### \n\n### **Big decisions still loom**\n\nThe law\u2019s ultimate aim, of course, is to cut the United States\u2019 vast contributions to planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution. \n\nThe Energy Department projects that the IRA, along with 2021\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure law, will have a large impact \u2014 causing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to drop by up to 41 percent from 2005 levels by the end of this decade. That would make up a significant chunk of Biden\u2019s goal of cutting carbon emissions 50 to 52 percent by 2030.\n\nBut those goals depend on some major decisions that the administration has yet to announce in how it will disburse the IRA\u2019s money.\n\nThose include a new tax credit for hydrogen, a fuel that many experts view as critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from heavy industry. \n\nThe Treasury Department is developing accounting rules that will determine whether hydrogen makers must build new renewable energy sources to receive the tax credit. The existing hydrogen industry and business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce oppose that requirement. \n\nThe administration is not expected to unveil initial guidance on the credit until the fall, missing a key deadline under the law. \n\nTreasury also must issue closely-watched clarity on which electric vehicles could be left out of a consumer credit because of connections to China, as well as issue guidance for sustainable aviation fuel subsidies meant to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from air travel.\n\nOther groups hope to see the department clarify the rules it has already offered. For example, the department\u2019s initial guidance on the law\u2019s domestic content incentives, issued earlier this year, drew mixed reactions for not requiring the industry to use only U.S.-made materials for key solar panel components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItems left out of the climate law have also drawn attention on and off Capitol Hill. Those include proposals to clear away obstacles to building clean energy infrastructure, particularly permitting for new power generation and expanding the power grid to accommodate it.\n\n\nAnd the law\u2019s success depends on access to critical minerals such as lithium needed to build the vast number of batteries, wind turbines and solar panels the transition requires. The U.S. relies on imports for the vast majority of those materials, and growing competition as demand from around the world grows is expect to strain their supply \u2014 concerns laid out in a report earlier this week.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a \u2018dog caught car moment\u2019 for our sector, and we\u2019re delighted to be hanging on, but it\u2019s going to be quite a ride for the next several years,\u201d said Jason Grumet, the CEO of the American Clean Power Association.\n\n\n *Josh Siegel and Catherine Morehouse contributed to this report.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Filed under:\n* [Climate Change](https://www.politico.com/news/climate-change),\n* [Ron Wyden](https://www.politico.com/news/ron-wyden),\n* [Joe Biden](https://www.politico.com/news/joe-biden),\n* [Joe Biden 2020](https://www.politico.com/news/joe-biden-2020-presidential-election),\n* [Inflation](https://www.politico.com/news/inflation),\n* [Economics](https://www.politico.com/news/economics),\n* [Fossil Fuels](https://www.politico.com/news/fossil-fuels),\n* [Ro Khanna](https://www.politico.com/tag/ro-khanna)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/)\n\n\n* \n* \n* + Link Copied\n* + \n\t+ \n\t+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### \nBreaking News Alerts\n\n\n\n \n Sign up for POLITICO Breaking News Alerts to receive the latest updates in your inbox.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking News Alerts\n\n\n Sign up for POLITICO Breaking News Alerts to receive the latest updates in your inbox.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n By signing up, you acknowledge and agree to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.politico.com/privacy) and [Terms of Use](https://www.politico.com/terms-of-service).

These projects will avoid emissions from their degradation, contribute to additional carbon sequestration and at the same time, promote multiple environmental and social benefits. It will also launch initiatives to promote emerging solutions and sustainable production processes.  \n\n\nIts business plan focuses on regions where Iberdrola is present and where these nature-based solutions have significant potential, so that Latin American countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile will host 80% of its projects, while countries in the northern hemisphere, such as Spain, the United Kingdom and Portugal, will account for the remaining 20%. Today,\u00a0Carbon2Nature is already working on the development of projects in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Spain.  \n\n\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Tamargo, director of Carbon2Nature, explains that\u00a0'to face the global challenge of climate change, the firm was created with the ambition to make a long-term impact at an international level. In order to achieve this, it is committed to diversification in geographies and projects and promotes collaborative strategies for their development with local communities and other actors, guaranteeing the highest levels of quality. We come to this new market with humility and a desire to do things differently, bringing all of Iberdrola's experience in sustainability to the world of nature-based solutions and the generation of carbon credits'.\u00a0\n\nAll projects will be certified against internationally recognised quality standards, which will also validate their contribution to improving biodiversity, the\u00a0well-being of local communities and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\u00a0  \n\n\n**The zero net emissions commitment**  \n\n\nCarbon2Nature underscores Iberdrola's commitment to a sustainable energy model in harmony with nature and people. This model is underpinned by two main objectives: to\u00a0achieve net-zero emissions in all scopes by 2040 and to have a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030,\u00a0according to its Biodiversity Plan.  \n\n\nThe company is therefore able to take advantage of the synergies between Iberdrola's climate and biodiversity objectives, allowing it to expand and extend its internal nature restoration projects, and realising the opportunities of the green economy. As such, in 2020 it launched the\u00a0Tree Programme\u00a0to promote the\u00a0conservation and planting of 20 million trees by 2030.\u00a0\n\nIberdrola has launched Carbon2Nature through its start-up programme,\u00a0PERSEO, which has helped the utility to implement\u00a0innovative solutions to boost renewable energies, decarbonisation and electrification of the economy, digitalisation of grids, promotion of efficient storage and care for the environment.\u00a0\n\nThe programme's ecosystem includes more than\u00a07,500 start-ups,\u00a0including unicorns - companies valued at more than $1 billion - such as electric vehicle charging solutions manufacturer Wallbox and Stem, which offers smart battery storage solutions.\u00a0  \n\n\n*Source:\u00a0

Tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the cost of installing rooftop solar panels by 30%, which will in turn lower monthly electricity bills.\n\n\n\n \n Michael Conroy/AP\n \n \n\n\n\nA year ago, Sonia Aggarwal watched from home as the votes came in on the U.S. Senate floor. Aggarwal was working as a White House aide, advising the Biden administration on climate policy. She'd been up all night, listening as senators debated legislation she and many others had spent more than a year trying to pass. \n\n When Vice President Kamala Harris finally [cast the tie-breaking vote](https://www.c-span.org/video/?522197-1/senate-session) \u2014 51 to 50 \u2014 on Aug. 7, 2022, Aggarwal was in tears. \n\n With that vote, the country's most significant climate legislation made it through the U.S. Senate, a body that had stymied [previous](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/23/us-senate-climate-change-bill) [efforts](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/us/intense-lobbying-against-global-warming-treaty.html) for decades. The bill went on to clear the U.S. House, and made its way to President Biden for his signature on Aug. 16, 2022. \n\n \n\n\n\"The Inflation Reduction Act is the most significant step forward on climate in American history,\" Aggarwal said. \"Full stop.\"\n\n The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may have a bureaucratic name, but it sets expansive goals. The policy aims to dramatically decrease the U.S. contribution to climate change, slashing greenhouse gas emissions by shifting the economy away from fossil fuels.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n![](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/08/14/gettyimages-1415247940_custom-bc700d99434bcc24295d32fb503cfd625fd4cece-s1100-c50.jpg)\n\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/08/14/gettyimages-1415247940_custom-bc700d99434bcc24295d32fb503cfd625fd4cece-s1200.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n President Biden signs the Inflation Reduction Act with (from left) Sen.

Kathy Castor, D-Fla., in the State Dining Room of the White House on Aug. 16, 2022.\n\n\n\n \n Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n \n \n\n\n\nThe law directs at least $369 billion \u2014 [and potentially much more](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/business/ira-climate-tax-breaks-biden.html) \u2014 toward incentives for nearly every sector of the economy to adopt renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies. \n\n The goal is to make alternatives cheaper \u2014 and more attractive \u2014 than fossil fuels, said Jesse Jenkins, a professor at Princeton University who advised on the law.\n\n \"What the Inflation Reduction Act effectively does, is it aligns the full financial might of the federal government behind the push towards cleaner energy resources,\" Jenkins said. \"In essence, it puts clean energy on sale for households and businesses and industries all over the country.\" \n\n The law faces opposition among Republican lawmakers. It passed along party lines, with only Democrats voting in favor. Since Republicans gained control of the U.S. House this year, many have [called for repealing its incentives](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/20/house-gop-debt-limit-plan-inflation-reduction-act-00092891), arguing the price tag is too high, and transitioning away from fossil fuels shouldn't be a priority. \n\n \n\n\nHere are three takeaways as the first major U.S. climate policy turns one. \n\n ### \"Rocket fuel\" for renewable energy, but hurdles remain\n\n Nearly $200 billion in tax credits at the center of the IRA aim to clean up the two biggest sources of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions: transportation and power plants.\n\n The incentives are meant to help speed the transition to electric vehicles and boost the deployment of low-carbon energy like wind and solar power, while also encouraging companies to build those vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines in the U.S. \n\n One year in, that's starting to happen, say analysts and industry representatives.\n\n \"The IRA really has acted like rocket fuel across every segment and corner of our industry,\" Heather O'Neill, head of the trade group Advanced Energy United, told reporters Monday.\n\n Projects like wind and solar farms take years of planning, so it's too soon to see the law driving new power onto the grid, said Chris Seiple at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.But Wood Mackenzie estimates the amount of renewable power added to the grid each year will roughly triple by 2030 as a result of the IRA, he said. \n\n \"This is legislation that is going to result in a radical transformation of the electric supply in the United States,\" Seiple said.\n\n Meanwhile, companies have issued a steady stream of announcements for new factories in the U.S., especially for electric vehicles, batteries, and solar panel components. The vast majority of solar and battery manufacturing currently takes place outside the U.S., [much](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/16/business/china-ev-battery.html) [of it](https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary) in China.\n\n But both automakers and renewable energy developers face major challenges.\n\n [Auto workers are worried](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/26/1189928190/uaw-union-talks-auto-workers-trump-biden-shawn-fain-2024) they'll be left behind in the transition to electric vehicles. Wind and solar developers say their projects face increasing opposition from local communities, some of it [fueled by misinformation](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/16/1164050912/activists-spread-misleading-information-to-fight-solar). The electric grid is also struggling to accommodate new projects, with many already [waiting years](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176462647/green-energy-transmission-queue-power-grid-wind-solar) for permission to connect.\n\n \n\n\nGregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy, an industry trade group, said on some level he welcomes the current challenges. They're a result, he said, of \"trying to get so much done really rapidly, which is the pace we need to go to address the climate crisis.\"\n\n ### There's money to \"electrify everything\" \u2014 but it may roll out slowly\n\n Another focus of the law? You. Or at least your car, your gas stove and your furnace. \n\n The Inflation Reduction Act makes billions of dollars available to help households switch to electric vehicles, replace fossil fuel-powered heating and cooling systems with more efficient electric [heat pumps](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/01/1166267716/6-things-to-know-about-heat-pumps-a-climate-solution-in-a-box#:~:text=Heat%20pumps%20can%20work%20for,cool%20air%20on%20hot%20days.), install solar panels and insulate homes.\n\n The law makes the electrification of American households the \"hinge point\" of U.S. climate policy, said Ari Matusiak, the chief executive officer of Rewiring America, a nonprofit campaigning to cut household emissions, which offers an [online guide](https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/) to the subsidies. \n\n Some of the money is available now, as credits when you file your tax return. For instance, the law offers a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of certain electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs. \n\n Credits, however, often cover only a fraction of the cost of major retrofits, like installing a heat pump. \n\n Some benefits for low- and moderate-income households may not become available for months or years. The law creates a rebate program to reduce the up-front cost of electric appliances and home retrofits for households making up to a certain amount. Those programs will be administered by states, which have indicated it will take some time to staff up. Virginia's state department of energy [has said](https://whro.org/news/local-news/40483-electric-cars-solar-panels-and-more-here-s-how-virginians-can-access-millions-through-the-inflation-reduction-act) it could take one or two years before the program is up and running.\n\n ### Yes, the law reduces U.S. climate impact. But it's not enough.\n\n Studies indicate the IRA will help significantly reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The think tank Rhodium Group [found](https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2023/) the IRA could cut emissions up to 48% from their peak by 2035.\n\n \n\n\nThe act still falls short of the U.S. commitment under the international Paris Agreement, to cut emissions in half from their 2005 peak by 2030. The U.S. has committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, which means contributing no new greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere.\n\n [Scientists say](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) those targets are necessary to limit warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.\n\n The Biden administration is rolling out other efforts to close the gap. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed [new rules](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/11/1169967646/an-epa-proposal-to-almost-eliminate-climate-pollution-from-power-plants) to cut emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants, and to restrict emissions of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas.\n\n Sonia Aggarwal is now the chief executive officer of the California-based environmental policy firm Energy Innovation. She says two things are true: the U.S. is moving faster than seemed possible just a few years ago. And it's still not fast enough. \n\n But she sees the IRA ushering in a new phase. \n\n \"We have completely changed direction on our energy policy such that we will actually have a chance to meet our climate goals, which certainly was not the case even just a couple of years ago,\" Aggarwal said. \n\n *NPR's Camila Domonoske contributed to this reporting.* \n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Tax

\"Mail\")\n* [Print](# \"Print\")\n\n\n\nLONDON \u2014\u00a0Rishi Sunak batted away calls for a public vote on Britain's plan to cut carbon emissions by 2050 \u2014 amid anti-green pressure from Nigel Farage and some of Sunak's own Tory MPs.\n\n\n\"I'm committed to net zero ... I think actually there's agreement on it,\" the British PM told ITV Wednesday, when asked if he would put the emissions target to a referendum.\n\n\nThe U.K.'s pledge to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 has been the [subject of much debate](https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-climate-consensus-net-zero-green-policy/) lately. While still committed to the legally-binding headline target, Sunak has called for a \"pragmatic and proportionate\" approach to cutting emissions and made a show of expressing his support for motorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome in his party want Sunak to go further, citing the impact of a switch to clean energy on voters already hit by rising prices. Those calling for a rethink were boosted by a recent narrow London by-election win for Tories who campaigned against the expansion of a clean air plan.\n\n \n### \n \n You may like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[UK banks shun companies trading with Ukraine](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-bank-close-accounts-british-smes-trading-with-ukraine/)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Sebastian Whale](https://www.politico.eu/author/sebastian-whale/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Former Finnish PM Alexander Stubb to run for president](https://www.politico.eu/article/former-finland-pm-alexander-stubb-to-run-for-president/)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Elisa Braun](https://www.politico.eu/author/elisa-braun/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Russia lifts rates to 12 percent to boost ruble](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-lifts-rates-to-12-percent-to-boost-ruble/)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Izabella Kaminska](https://www.politico.eu/author/izabella-kaminska/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Brexit Party leader Farage on Wednesday renewed his longstanding call for the government to put the target to a referendum, telling [the Telegraph newspaper](https://twitter.com/dominicpenna/status/1691718625617485926?s=46&t=ad99pZjtYc1b_NC_IsMSfQ) the target is \"unrealistic, unaffordable, and our politicians, to date, are unaccountable.\" \n\n\n\"The only way we'll get change is through a referendum, just like with the EU,\" he argued.\n\n\nAsked directly about such calls for a referendum, Sunak said Brits were already behind the target.\n\n\n\"I think most people are committed to getting to net zero but getting there in a proportion and pragmatic way ...

in last month's Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election - largely thanks to a local backlash against the expansion of [London](/news/london/index.html)'s Ultra Low Emission Zone ([ULEZ](/news/ulez/index.html)) - has seen some MPs to call for a review of green policies.\n\nThis includes backbenchers demanding the Government to put the 2050 net zero target to a nationwide vote.\n\nUnder the objective signed into law by Theresa May when she was PM, the UK is legally obliged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 100 per cent from 1990 levels over the next 27 years.\n\n   ![Rishi Sunak has rejected Tory calls for a referendum on the Government's pledge to reach net zero by

ITV News this evening, Mr Sunak reaffirmed that he was 'committed to net zero'.\n\n'I have two young daughters, I care about the environment that we - I - leave them, ' the PM said.\n\n'My job is to leave it in a better state than I found it.\n\n'But I think the path to net zero has got to be one that we tread carefully, that we bring everyone along with us on that journey, and we make that journey in a proportionate and a pragmatic way.\n\n'So, my view is I'm committed to it.

I think that has broad support.'\n\nThe PM's stance is set to disappoint Tory 'Red Wall' MPs who had been pushing for a net zero referendum.\n\nMarco Longhi, the MP for Dudley North, told the Telegraph this week: 'Given the complexity of this issue and its far-reaching consequences, I believe that involving the public through a referendum is right.\n\n'A proper debate has never been had, and it should be.\n\n'A referendum would require the Government to communicate the intricacies of the 2050 net zero target to the public, fostering a better understanding of the challenges and benefits.'\n\nKarl McCartney, the Lincoln MP, agreed that Mr Sunak should 'rethink the headlong rush for net zero', adding: 'The establishment was solely focused on chasing approval from London's woke eco-zealot crowd who have no clue what happens in the real world.\n\n'Just like Brexit, the Government needs to make sure the public are on board with such radical changes, and that they hear the arguments and can make an informed decision.'\n\nMr Sunak was also asked by ITV News about Greenpeace targeting his constituency home while he was away on holiday in the US with his family.\n\nA group of demonstrators scaled the Sunaks' Grade II-listed constituency manor house in Richmond, North Yorkshire, to protest against his oil and gas licences announcement.\n\nThe activists draped an oil-black fabric from the roof, staying there from about 8am to 1.15pm, when they were arrested and later bailed as part of an ongoing investigation by North Yorkshire Police.\n\nThe PM suggested he agreed that it should not have been possible for protesters to get to his Yorkshire home, but said it 'wouldn't be right' for him to comment further following the arrests.\n\nMr Sunak said he had

This commitment has a 2019 baseline.\n\n\nThe SBTi has verified that the target is in line with the 1.5C pathway of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\nSage Group\u2019s priority focus areas for addressing Scope 1 (direct) and 2 (power-related) emissions include improving energy efficiency and procuring renewable electricity for its workplaces. At present, it meets 45% of its global electricity consumption needs. It will plan ways of increasing this proportion, including for employees working remotely and in hybrid patterns.\n\n\nAdditionally, Sage is refreshing its approach to employee engagement on climate. It will soon launch a carbon literacy programme for staff.\n\n\nAs with many other large businesses, Sage sees a significant proportion of its emissions arising from Scope 3 (indirect) sources. It is therefore requesting that all suppliers measure and disclose \u201caccurate and verified\u201d data on their emissions to Sage via CDP. Suppliers without their own SBTi-approved targets are also being encouraged and supported to set them.\n\n\nSage\u2019s executive VP for sustainability and society, Elisa Moscolin, said: \u201cAs a FTSE 100 corporation, we have an important role to play in driving sustainable business practices, but our ambition goes beyond our four walls: we are just as focused on empowering small and medium businesses across the world to get to net-zero.\n\n\n\u201cWith the right plans and people in place, I\u2019m looking forward to making progress against our targets and sharing our successes and learnings to ignite sustainable change across our ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\nSome 3,200 companies have set targets verified by the SBTi and around 11% of them are in the technology sector.\n\n\nThe SBTi is [in the process of phasing out 2C-aligned targets in a bid to push corporates to be more ambitious and align with 1.5C.](https://www.edie.net/sbti-to-increase-minimum-target-setting-requirements-to-1-5c/) It has also [begun to \u2018name and shame\u2019 businesses that fail to follow through on commitments to have their emissions goals verified.](https://www.edie.net/business-giants-named-and-shamed-for-flouting-science-based-targets-pledges/#:~:text=The%20Science%2DBased%20Targets%20Initiative,this%20timeframe%20from%20its%20dashboard.)\n\n\n**Kier Group** \n\n\nIn related news, Kier Highways Ltd has had new emissions goals verified by the SBTi as 1.5C-aligned through to 2030 and aligned with the initiative\u2019s Net-Zero Standard in the longer term.\n\n\nThe Net-Zero Standard requires companies to reduce emissions across all scopes by at least 90% by 2050 at the latest.\n\n\nKier Highways has pledged to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by more than 97% by 2039. It will also reduce Scope 3 emissions by 90% by 2045. This will enable it to create a net-zero value chain by this point. It is hoping to bring the former targets forward if possible.\n\n\nIn the meantime, interim targets have been set to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030. To help deliver this, Kier Highways will transition to 100% renewable electricity, up from 0% in the 2018 baseline year.\n\n\nKier Group, the parent company of Kier Highways, is currently awaiting SBTi verificiation for group-wide emissions targets \u2013 both near-term and longer-term.\n\n\n\u201cReducing our emissions as quickly as possible in order to help limit the impact of climate change is a top priority for us,\u201d said Kier Transportation\u2019s head of environment and sustainability Matt Tompsett.\n\n\n\u201cWe are already seeing the impacts of climate change all around us in the form of extreme weather. This impacts our staff, our local communities and our ability to deliver our projects for our clients.\u201d\n\n\n***The SBTi\u2019s chief impact officer Maria Outters is a guest on edie\u2019s most recent Sustainability Uncovered podcast episode.

Thanks to the partnership, we've been able to invest in solar and desalination technology which has both lowered our emissions and allowed us to supply delicious tomatoes to Coles customers all year round,\" said Steve.\n\nMeat and Livestock Australia Managing Director Jason Strong congratulated Coles on working with its suppliers to take positive action on climate, as the Australian red meat and livestock sector works towards achieving its target of being carbon neutral by 2030.\n\n\"Initiatives like this from Coles have potential to provide direction and leadership to help achieve our target of carbon neutrality by 2030. We look forward to seeing the progress Coles can make with its supply chain in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nThis new target and resulting emission reductions will help Coles and its suppliers support the delivery of Australia's national Paris Agreement commitment to reduce emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\nTo further support suppliers to drive innovation and sustainability, Coles continues to award grants of up to $500,000 to small and medium sized businesses as part of the Coles Nurture Fund. To date more than $33 million has been provided to over 100 businesses since the initiative started in 2015.\n\n\n![Coles supplier at his farm](https://www.colesgroup.com.au/FormBuilder/_Resource/_module/ir5sKeTxxEOndzdh00hWJw/image/170823_SCOPE_3.jpg)\n\n\n/Public Release.

Every sector, from agriculture to health, feels the weight of its impact. Yet, Africa, contributing a mere 5% of global GHG emissions, stands at the frontline of vulnerability.\n \n\n\n MTN recognizes this challenge and is poised to lead the charge toward a brighter, sustainable future. The recent COP27, aptly named the \"African COP,\" spotlighted Africa's unique position-rich in opportunities yet fraught with challenges. We were not just participants; we were collaborators, inspired by the global commitment to support developing nations.\n \n\n\n The journey to a low-carbon economy is more than an environmental mandate; it's a call for equity, inclusivity, and a recognition of Africa's diverse landscape. Success means more than reduced emissions; it means broader access to modern amenities, enhanced telecommunications, and pathways to sustainable livelihoods.\n \n\n\n MTN's 2023 climate change report, aligned to Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), outlines our unwavering commitment to addressing climate change. Our Project Zero, with its ambitious goal of Net Zero emissions by 2040, is a testament to our dedication and belief in growth that harmonizes with, not against, our planet's well-being.\n \n\n\n Our actions echo our words. This year, we have taken bold steps, from submitting our climate goals to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to expanding our green energy footprint. We are not just aiming for growth; we are aiming for sustainable growth.\n \n\n\n We are investing in the future-electric vehicles, high-efficiency lighting, solar, wind, and battery storage into our operations. Believing that these types of investments can bring about a thriving green economy, fostering green industries, green enterprises, and green jobs for Africa by Africans.\n \n\n\n Our digital innovations are resilient by design, primed to counteract the capricious impacts of climate change. With the rollout of our advanced 5G and fibre networks, we will further increase energy efficiency in terms of energy consumption per traffic unit.\n \n\n\n But the journey is not without its hurdles. The rising demand for connectivity, for instance, brings with it the challenge of increased energy consumption. Yet, we are undeterred. Inspired by our belief that everyone deserves a modern, connected life, we are charting a course toward a sustainable future.\n \n\n\n Africa's moment is now. We are embracing the challenges, unlocking the opportunities, and driving toward a future where technology and sustainability converge. Our path is clear, and our commitment is unwavering. Together, we're building a sustainable, inclusive world for all.\n \n\nClick here to read our 2023 Climate change report.\n \n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "MTN is committed to addressing climate change and aims to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "MTN's commitment to addressing climate change and setting an ambitious goal for Net Zero emissions by 2040 is seen as a positive effort towards sustainability."}, {"summary": "MTN is investing in green technologies such as electric vehicles, high-efficiency lighting, solar, wind, and battery storage.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "MTN's investments in green technologies are considered positive as they can contribute to a thriving green economy and create green jobs for Africa."}, {"summary": "MTN aims to increase energy efficiency in their networks through the rollout of advanced 5G and fibre networks.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "MTN's focus on increasing energy efficiency in their networks is seen as a positive step towards sustainability and reducing environmental impact."}, {"summary": "The rising demand for connectivity poses a challenge in terms of increased energy consumption.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The statement about the rising demand for connectivity and its challenge of increased energy consumption is a neutral observation."}, {"summary": "MTN is embracing the challenges and driving towards a future where technology and sustainability converge.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "MTN's readiness to embrace challenges and work towards a future where technology and sustainability converge is seen as a positive commitment."}], "semantic_commentary": "Potential buyer for carbon credits.", "sentiment_score": 0.8, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions that MTN is committed to addressing climate change and aims to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions that MTN is investing in green technologies such as electric vehicles, high-efficiency lighting, solar, wind, and battery storage."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions that MTN aims to increase energy efficiency in their networks through the rollout of advanced 5G and fibre networks."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions a challenge of increased energy consumption due to the rising demand for connectivity."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article provides news about MTN's commitment to addressing climate change and investing in green technologies."}]}, {"source": "WWSB", "link": "https://www.mysuncoast.com/prnewswire/2023/08/17/csl-appoints-jeffrey-ball-first-chief-sustainability-officer/", "title": "CSL Appoints Jeffrey Ball as First Chief Sustainability Officer", "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia, Aug. 17, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Global biotechnology leader CSL (ASX: CSL) (USOTC: CSLLY) announced today that **Jeffrey Ball**, an established global leader across multiple disciplines and functions, has been appointed Chief Sustainability Officer effective immediately.

He recognizes the business value of aligning the Sustainability Strategy with our 2030 Strategy, and of executing through careful consideration of our impacts, challenges, and opportunities, and taking meaningful action to realize our vision of a sustainable future for all our stakeholders.\"\n\nCSL's [Sustainability Strategy](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3945338-1&h=181126267&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.csl.com%2Fsustainability&a=Sustainability+Strategy) focuses on Environment, Social and Sustainable Workforce, with strong Governance underpinning all pillars. On the Environment pillar, CSL is focusing on integrating sustainability into business decisions, reducing carbon emissions, minimizing end-to-end production of waste through removal, reduction & recycling and is supporting similar efforts throughout its supply chain. In June 2023, CSL committed to seeking validation of its near-term company-wide emissions reduction in line with climate science with the SBTi.\n\nMr Ball said, \"I am honored to serve as CSL's first Chief Sustainability Officer and to continue the work of embedding sustainability throughout the enterprise. I am proud of the significant work the CSL team has already done and look forward to the opportunity to advance these important efforts. Guided by CSL's values and our purpose for a sustainable future for people and planet, we are taking the critical next steps on our sustainability journey.\"\n\nPrior to joining CSL, Mr Ball served as the Executive Officer of Operations for Aspen Aerogels, where he was responsible for establishing the strategic and tactical direction of the supply side of the organization and forging a closer partnership with R&D to introduce new technologies, projects, and improvements. Prior to Aspen Aerogels, Mr Ball held various leadership roles of increasing responsibility in the chemical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with Genzyme, Amgen, and Bayer. Mr Ball earned his bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Bucknell University and his master's degree in Chemical Engineering from Villanova University.\n\n**About CSL**\n\n[CSL](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3945338-1&h=212824024&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.csl.com%2F&a=CSL)\u00a0(ASX:CSL; USOTC:CSLLY) is a global biotechnology company with a dynamic\u00a0portfolio of lifesaving medicines, including those that treat haemophilia and immune deficiencies, vaccines to prevent influenza, and therapies in iron deficiency and nephrology.

(MHI) has delivered and installed a compact CO2 pilot capture system \"CO2MPACT\u2122\" at its cement plant in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n\n\nThrough a partnership between Heidelberg Materials, the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta, the facility is expected to become the first full-scale carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) solution for the cement industry globally. The new facility, which Heidelberg Materials anticipates being operational by late 2026, will capture more than 1 million tonnes of CO2 annually from its Edmonton cement plant and the combined heat and power facility that is integrated with the capture process.\n\n\nAlberta Minister of Environment and Protected Areas, Rebecca Schulz, joined the Heidelberg Materials and MHI teams at the Edmonton cement plant to formally initiate operations of the pilot CO2 capture system. \"Alberta is widely recognized as a leader in developing CCUS technology thanks in large part to industry trailblazers like Heidelberg Materials,\" said Minister Rebecca Schulz. \"Our province has invested billions of dollars to help industry cut emissions and will continue to support practical innovations that create jobs and grow the economy. We look forward to seeing this exciting Alberta success story continue in the years ahead.\"\n\n\nThis project supports Heidelberg Materials' vision of leading the decarbonization of the cement industry. Actively contributing to the development of the new 1.5\u00b0C framework, Heidelberg Materials was the first company in the cement sector to have its targets endorsed by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in 2019.\n\n\n\"Today is substantial milestone in our journey to building the world's first full-scale carbon capture project in the cement industry,\" said Joerg Nixdorf, Vice President Cement Operations, Northwest Region for Heidelberg Materials North America. \"This initiative focuses the cement industry's decarbonization efforts on the Province of Alberta, and we are encouraged by this significant step to lead the sector in CCUS.\"\n\n\nThe Edmonton cement plant will leverage MHI's proprietary Advanced KM CDR Process\u2122 using the KS-21\u2122 solvent (jointly developed with The Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc.) and will initially pilot the technology by testing different fuel sources and various plant operating modes. The pilot plant will enable Heidelberg Materials to validate the effectiveness of MHI's technology on its specific flue gas as part of a two-stage competitive process that is currently underway to inform the final design. At full operation, captured CO2 will be transported via pipeline and permanently sequestered. MHI's involvement also includes providing remote support services for the facility, using its proprietary remote monitoring system. \"MHI Group is proud to collaborate with Heidelberg Materials as an innovative solution provider for decarbonization of the cement sector, which is still a new frontier for CCUS and excited to contribute to the effort on carbon neutrality in the Province of Alberta.\" said Kenji Terasawa, CEO and Head of Engineering Solutions.\n\n\n\n\n![With Alberta Environment Minister in front of MHI's newly installed carbon capture system at Heidelberg Materials' cement plant in Canada, Aug. 15, 2023 \n(photo courtesy of Heidelberg Materials.)](/jp/media/406351/download \"With Alberta Environment Minister in front of MHI's newly installed carbon capture system at Heidelberg Materials' cement plant in Canada, Aug. 15, 2023 \n(photo courtesy of Heidelberg Materials.)\")With Alberta Environment Minister in front of MHI's newly installed carbon capture system at Heidelberg Materials' cement plant in Canada, Aug. 15, 2023 (photo courtesy of Heidelberg Materials.)\n\n\n\n**About MHI Group's CO2 Capture Technologies**  \n\nMHI has been developing the KM CDR Process \u2122 (Kansai Mitsubishi Carbon Dioxide Recovery Process) and Advanced KM CDR Process \u2122 in collaboration with Kansai Electric Power since 1990. As of August 2023, the Company has delivered 15 plants adopting the KM CDR Process \u2122, and three more are currently under construction. The Advanced KM CDR Process \u2122 uses KS-21 \u2122, which incorporates technological improvements over the amine-based KS-1 \u2122 solvent adopted at all 15 of the commercial CO2 capture plants MHI has delivered to date. The advanced version offers superior regeneration efficiency and lower deterioration than the KS-1 \u2122, and it has been verified to provide excellent energy saving performance, reduce operating costs, and result in low amine emissions.\n\n\nFor further information on MHI's CO2 capture plants:\n\n\n* [https://www.mhi.com/products/engineering/co2plants.html](/products/engineering/co2plants.html\n)\n\n**About Heidelberg Materials**  \n\nBased in Irving, Texas, Heidelberg Materials North America is part of Heidelberg Materials, one of the world's largest integrated manufacturers of building materials and solutions.

The UNESCO World Heritage site Duerrenstein-Lassingtal Wilderness Area in Lower Austria has announced its first climate partnership with a cosmetics and food supplements company, aiming to provide corporates with a means to offset their emissions while protecting valuable nature. The area consists of a large primeval forest and has been listed as a World Heritage site since 2017. It has now launched the Klimapartnerschaft.at. Under the partnership, cosmetics firm Ringana has provided finance to take 139 ha of the forest \u201cout of use\u201d for 10 years, and it is estimated this will store 833 tonnes of CO2 annually. ([Carbon Pulse](https://carbon-pulse.com/216605/))\n\n\n**Joining in** \u2013 California-based land management restoration firm Vibrant Planet this week became the latest to join the UN-backed Biodiversity Credit Alliance, a coalition of companies working on developing principles and guidance for the voluntary biodiversity credit market. For more about the alliance\u2019s plans, [read this interview](https://carbon-pulse.com/202356/) Carbon Pulse did with acting BCA coordinator Johan Maree in May.\n\n\n***BUSINESS & FINANCE***\n\n\n**Elephiance** \u2013 WWF is launching the Asian Elephant Alliance (AEA) to secure a future in which loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats is reduced, people and elephants live side by side in a sustainable way, and wild elephant populations are stable. The Alliance calls for partnership and collective action as it acknowledges that the challenges faced by the elephants in the region cannot be solved in isolation. Improved research, monitoring, protection, and management are the key focus areas of AEA. ([Vietnamnet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/asian-elephant-alliance-launched-2177170.html))\n\n\n**Coming back** \u2013 Conservationists are planting trees to lure the endangered glossy black cockatoo back to the South Australian mainland, where it has been extinct for decades. Two potential \u201cscouting\u201d birds have already been spotted. For now, the SA subspecies of \u201cglossies\u201d exists only on Kangaroo Island, where it rose from the ashes of the 2019-20 bushfires that destroyed much of its habitat. Now, Greening Australia and WWF Australia are planting almost 20,000 trees in the hope of tempting the birds across Backstairs Passage to the Fleurieu Peninsula.

The inquiry will look at how private investment can help achieve the government\u2019s nature commitments and how the UK might develop markets in natural capital assets while avoiding the greenwashing of investments. ([ESG Clarity](https://esgclarity.com/uk-launches-inquiry-into-role-of-private-investment-in-nature/))\n\n\n***SCIENCE & TECH***\n\n\n**What works** \u2013 Protected areas, land managed by Indigenous people, ecosystem payment services, commodity certification programmes, supply-chain initiatives, and strong legislation are the efforts that work best to halt deforestation, according to [research released this week](https://www.conservation.org/press-releases/2023/08/16/how-to-best-halt-and-reverse-deforestation-largest-study-of-its-kind-finds-answers) by Conservation International and the University of British Columbia. The study, an update on a 2017 report on the same issue, was intended to help policy-makers as they draw up plans to meet their Global Biodiversity Framework commitments. Agriculture and livestock were found to be major drivers of deforestation, while good governance, democracy, peace, land tenure rights, and gender balance were found to largely have little impact on deforestation levels.\n\n\n**Got a tip?

The resort has tapped researchers at Southwestern University in Texas in the effort, with student scientists staking out test plots on five ski runs where they can monitor vegetation growth using native seeds, compost and\u00a0[biochar](https://coloradosun.com/2023/04/07/biochar-carbon-capture-climate-change/).\n\n\n### Read more from Jason Blevins at [ColoradoSun.com](https://coloradosun.com/2023/08/15/copper-mountain-conservation-summit/).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Environment\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/2/2023/08/16104036/Screen-Shot-2023-08-16-at-9.55.40-AM-300x225.png)](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/copper-mountain-starts-seeding-to-spark-a-landscape-scale-biodiversity-effort/)\n\n\n#### [Copper Mountain starts seeding to spark a landscape-scale biodiversity effort](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/copper-mountain-starts-seeding-to-spark-a-landscape-scale-biodiversity-effort/)\n\n\n\nAug 16, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/2/2023/08/15103912/120914_FP_Powerlines-1240x799-1-150x150.jpg)](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/1-5-billion-hydropower-development-pushes-forward-in-northwest-colorado/)\n\n\n###### [$1.5 billion hydropower development pushes forward in Northwest Colorado](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/1-5-billion-hydropower-development-pushes-forward-in-northwest-colorado/)\n\n\n\nAug 15, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/2/2022/10/21170406/Screen-Shot-2022-10-08-at-4.51.13-PM-150x150.png)](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/40-million-people-share-the-shrinking-colorado-river-heres-how-that-water-gets-divvied-up/)\n\n\n###### [40 million people share the shrinking Colorado River.

Credit: Liu Chenggang\n  \n\n\nLand use change is one of the greatest threats to soil biodiversity and ecological functions. Tropical deforestation to establish monoculture cash tree plantations poses the greatest threat to biodiversity. However, how such a transition affects soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics driven by fungal communities at the aggregate level remains unclear.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a study published in *Science of The Total Environment*, researchers from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences assessed the impact of tropical land use change on soil fungal functional guilds and the effects on soil C and N cycling processes at the aggregate level.\n\n\nThe researchers determined C and N fractions, [fungal communities](https://phys.org/tags/fungal+communities/), enzymatic activities and chemical properties within three soil aggregates in a [natural forest](https://phys.org/tags/natural+forest/), 12- and 24-year-old rubber monocultures and corresponding agroforestry systems in Xishuangbanna, southwest China.\n\n\nThey found that the differential [land use change](https://phys.org/tags/land+use+change/) on soil C and N dynamics were mediated by fungal functional guilds across aggregate sizes. The C and N pools in all aggregates were generally reduced when [tropical forests](https://phys.org/tags/tropical+forests/) were converted to rubber monocultures. Microbial C and N biomass decreased in agroforestry systems.\n\n\nCarbon- and N-degrading enzyme activities responded differently to forest conversion and were increased in agroforestry systems. As the soil aggregate size decreased, the levels of C and N pools and associated enzyme activities increased.\n\n\nIn addition, pathogenic fungi increased at the expense of saprotrophic and symbiotic fungi with forest conversion. Soil aggregate size influenced fungal diversity rather than composition, with microaggregates having the highest diversity.\n\n\nC and N pools within aggregates were variedly affected by fungal functional guilds, mainly driven by soil pH, regardless of land use type. According to the researchers, all the differences were attributed to changes in species diversity, soil properties and associated agroforestry management.\n\n\n\"Our study provides an important insight into the early establishment of agroforestry systems in tropical cash tree plantations due to the greater benefits in nutrient cycling and pathogen control,\" said Liu Chenggang of XTBG.\n \n \n\n\n**More information:**\n Chenggang Liu et al, Land use change alters carbon and nitrogen dynamics mediated by fungal functional guilds within soil aggregates, *Science of The Total Environment* (2023).

However, what conditions these \u2018canopy soils\u2019 form in, and what kind of biodiversity they support, has been difficult to study.\n\n\n\n> The fact it\u2019s taken until now to even start to recognise [canopy soils'] importance is amazing \u2013 not least because we may be destroying them faster than we can study them. Dr Bonnie Waring\n\n\nNow, researchers from Utah State University and Imperial College London have surveyed dozens of trees in Costa Rica, mapping the canopy soils to determine where they form and how they might be affected by a changing climate. The results are published in *[Geoderma](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116609)*.\n\n\nFirst author Jessica Murray, from Utah State University, said: \u201cWe found canopy soils most often form in cool, foggy areas in these tropical forests where there are large, old trees. Unfortunately, this describes some of the most at-risk forest types, which are threatened by changing climate and deforestation.\u201d\n\n\nHer PhD supervisor [Dr Bonnie Waring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.waring), now at the Department of Life Sciences (Silwood Park) at Imperial, added: \u201cCanopy soils in tropical cloud forests are rich in life and nutrients and could be large carbon stores. The fact it\u2019s taken until now to even start to recognise their importance is amazing \u2013 not least because we may be destroying them faster than we can study them.\u201d\n\n\nUnique habitat\n--------------\n\n\nTo study the soils, Murray climbed trees in six primary (i.e. untouched) rainforest sites in Costa Rica. These included sites along one of the last continuous lines of primary rainforest in South America, with elevations ranging from 67\u20132700 m above sea level and mean annual temperature ranging from 10\u201324\u00baC, plus variable rainfall and fog abundance.\n\n\n![The legs and feet of a person on a branch looking down into the forest far below](//www.imperial.ac.uk/ImageCropToolT4/imageTool/uploaded-images/pc-marco-molina_1692116890493_x2.jpg?r=4807)\nCredit: Marco Molina\n\nShe scaled trees up to heights of 15-30m to find canopy soils and measure their biodiversity and soil chemistry. This revealed a great diversity in composition, even along a branch and between trees close to each other \u2013 making each soil mat (soil + moss + plants) its \u201cown little forest\u201d.\n\n\nThese forests-in-miniature contain abundant plant and animal life, with invertebrates also supporting varied bird species. The plants include epiphytes \u2013 plants that live on other plants \u2013 which are especially common in cloud forests.\n\n\nCanopy soils are nutrient-rich, thanks to mosses that convert nitrogen from the air, meaning the epiphytes that live there are healthier than other types that live directly on tree bark (commonly known as air plants). There is even evidence that the trees themselves take advantage of the soils, growing roots into them to obtain some of the nutrients.\n\n\nUnder threat\n------------\n\n\nThe results show canopy soils in general were most abundant in higher, cooler areas with plenty of fog and larger, older trees. While it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how long they take to form, the team estimate some soil mats could take more than a hundred years to reach full maturity.\n\n\n\n> If these soils are crucial for the forest to be an optimum carbon sink, then their formation should be a final marker of a truly recovered forest. Jessica Murray\n\n\nUnfortunately, this means they could be difficult to replace if they are lost. As the climate heats up, the fog cloud levels are rising in these forests, meaning many soils could disappear and there may not be trees high enough to replace them.\n\n\nMany such forests have also been logged or face future deforestation, and even where forests have been allowed to recover (secondary forests), few if any would have had sufficient time to regrow mature canopy soils.\n\n\nMurray said: \u201cDetermining the contribution of canopy soils to forest carbon budgets is important for assessing their role in mitigating climate change. It could also be an important marker for recovery: if these soils are crucial for the forest to be an optimum carbon sink, then their formation should be a final marker of a truly recovered forest.\u201d\n\n\nThe rich habitat of canopy soils also means they hold a lot of carbon, and could be an important missing factor in carbon balance models \u2013 whether a forest as a whole is releasing or drawing down carbon. To determine the contribution, Murray says the next steps in the research will be to find a way to determine how much canopy soil there is within a landscape, for example via remote sensing.\n\n\nDr Waring concluded: \u201cThis research shows the value of intact forest ecosystems: restoration of logged forests is important, but some features can\u2019t be put back. We need some policies that focus on preserving landscapes that are ecologically diverse and carbon rich.\u201d\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u2018[Climate, as well as branch-level processes, drive canopy soil abundance and chemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706123002860)\u2019 by Jessica\u00a0Murray,\u00a0A.

This wealth of natural resources has made the country a target of logging and mining operations \u2013 and, in recent years, of [carbon finance](https://news.globallandscapesforum.org/60983/blue-carbon-emerges-as-a-small-but-growing-source-of-climate-finance/) schemes, too.\n\n Forest carbon credits could well be a boon for the relatively cash-poor country \u2013 if it can earn an adequate and appropriate income by keeping these ecosystems intact, rather than exploiting them.\n\n But many such projects don\u2019t seem to stand up to scrutiny. Earlier this year, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) published a confronting investigation, \u2018[Carbon Colonialism](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-14/carbon-credits-projects-papua-new-guinea-logging-four-corners/101936714),\u2019 which laid out a litany of concerns.\n\n The investigators honed in on the practices of an American company called NIHT Inc., which operates a carbon finance project in the isolated north-eastern province of New Ireland.\n\n The initiative operates in the voluntary [carbon market](https://news.globallandscapesforum.org/41410/a-brief-explainer-on-carbon-markets/), which means the credits are bought by companies and individuals seeking to offset their emissions voluntarily, rather than being sold through mandatory national or international carbon reduction regimes through what are known as compliance markets.\n\n The NIHT project promises to prevent commercial timber harvesting in its designated area, whilst helping alleviate poverty. But after traveling by boat to the province, the investigators found a vastly different story on the ground. Commercial logging *was* taking place within the project area, apparently permitted by Papua New Guinea authorities \u2013 and with NIHT\u2019s knowledge.\n\n  ![Wewak Papua New Guinea](data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MjcyODoxNjA3-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTAwIDYwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjkwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI2MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)![Wewak Papua New Guinea](https://i0.wp.com/news.globallandscapesforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PNG1_1280.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1)As of 2011, almost two-thirds of Papua New Guinea was [forested](https://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Papua_New_Guinea.htm). Osbourne Wangillen, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/m8kQGygT8KY) **Broken promises**\n-------------------\n\n What seems to have happened is that the company promised local communities considerable infrastructure \u2013 schools, health centers, housing, roads, etc. \u2013 as well as a regular income to replace potential earnings from logging the forests.\n\n But after community leaders signed up to the project \u2013 with little understanding of how it would work, and no access to independent legal advice \u2013 they received only minimal payments (around USD 80 per community member) and none of the promised infrastructure. So, they signed up for a logging operation in the same area.\n\n Following the ABC investigation, the NIHT project has been suspended from trading by its certifier Verra \u2013 the largest such body in the world \u2013 and landholders are now [taking the company to court](https://carbon-pulse.com/206618/).\n\n Verra itself has been shouldering serious concerns about its practices since The Guardian [published an investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) claiming that forest carbon offsets approved by the certifier are \u201clargely worthless\u201d in terms of creating genuine emission reductions.\n\n Since then, though, a long list of experts on climate mitigation have urged the global community not to \u2018throw the baby out with the bathwater\u2019 and give up entirely on carbon markets. They say carbon finance still has an important role in helping mitigate climate change, preserve biodiversity, and recognize and value the role of Indigenous Peoples in keeping the world\u2019s remaining tracts of carbon-rich primary forest intact.\n\n \u201cCarbon offsetting is often presented as either a panacea or as \u2018greenwashing\u2019 which constitutes a dangerous distraction from the difficult task of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Robert Nasi and Pham Thu Thuy, respectively the CEO and a senior scientist at [CIFOR-ICRAF](http://www.cifor-icraf.org/), in an [op-ed](https://news.mongabay.com/2023/02/forest-carbon-offsets-are-a-tool-not-a-silver-bullet-commentary/) responding to the Guardian article.\n\n \u201cIn reality, it is neither one nor the other. It is a tool. No particular policy instrument stands out as a \u2018silver bullet,\u2019 but improving the coherence and complementarity of the policy mix across government levels can enhance the effectiveness of policies \u2013 both individually and in combination.\u201d\n\n  ![Indigenous Papuan dance](data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=Mjc2MzoxMzQx-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTAwIDU5NCIgd2lkdGg9IjkwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1OTQiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+)![Indigenous Papuan dance](https://i0.wp.com/news.globallandscapesforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PNG2_1280.jpg?resize=900%2C594&ssl=1)Indigenous Papuans performing a traditional dance. Bob Brewer, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/GOIR5V_OH-k) **Can carbon markets be inclusive?**\n------------------------------------\n\n Earlier this year, a group of Indigenous-led organizations based in the Global South working in more than 40 countries released an [open letter](https://www.fscindigenousfoundation.org/global-south-voices-in-support-of-redd/) in support of high-integrity, inclusive carbon markets, which they say are currently one of the only ways to directly access climate finance.\n\n \u201cAs it stands now, there are very few ways for our communities to access the finance that we are due for our efforts and successes in protecting nature,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n Carbon finance projects \u201cprovide one of the only proven avenues available to our communities to access the finance required to not only conserve and protect our environments, but also to drive sustainable development for our communities that are shaped by our traditions and values,\u201d say the authors.\n\n \u201cRecent criticisms \u2026 have ignored these positive benefits and have put this critical source of finance at risk \u2013 ultimately putting the well-being of our communities at risk.\u201d\n\n Beto Borges, Director of the Communities and Territorial Governance Initiative at conservation finance nonprofit Forest Trends, agrees.\n\n \u201cWhen the media chooses to focus on the negative aspects of [carbon crediting programs] to prove a point, it directly harms communities and perpetuates their exclusion from the conversations and decisions they have a right to participate in,\u201d he said in a [recent article](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/artigos-sobre-cowboys-do-carbono-recebem-cliques-mas-correm-o-risco-de-ignorar-o-que-as-comunidades-indigenas-estao-realmente-dizendo/) on the topic.\n\n Back in Papua New Guinea, the government last year [imposed a moratorium](https://news.mongabay.com/2022/04/png-suspends-new-carbon-deals-scrambles-to-write-rules-for-the-schemes/) on new voluntary carbon schemes and has now created regulations attempted to better govern its voluntary carbon market. However, it has been criticized by local green groups for [breaching its own rules](https://carbon-pulse.com/212434/) in this process by not carrying out proper consultation, and there\u2019s still considerable concern about its capacity for enforcement.\n\n But challenges like these seem to call for more careful international engagement in the voluntary carbon market, rather than a reason to give up on the quest entirely.\n\n As the authors of the open letter state, \u201cwe need immediate and steadfast support from Global North governments and buyers \u2013 they must keep responsibly engaging with the voluntary carbon market and other REDD+ crediting programs as they continue to evolve and ensure finance continues to flow to the Global South.\u201d\n\n ", "summaries": [{"summary": "Papua New Guinea, a country with high biodiversity, has faced challenges with carbon finance projects, including logging within project areas and broken promises to local communities.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Logging taking place within project area and broken promises to local communities."}, {"summary": "The NIHT project has been suspended from trading by its certifier Verra, and landholders are taking the company to court.

CFTC and FTC Both Scrutinize Fraud in Carbon Markets | Holland & Knight LLP - JDSupra", "content": "\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have recently and aggressively signaled their intent to ramp up enforcement activity regarding the use of carbon offsets to make environmental claims. These moves should encourage market participants to understand and evaluate the impact of agency actions on any current and planned activities to make environmental marketing claims about use of offsets.\n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n\nCarbon offsets represent carbon emission reductions or removal and are traded in either in the over\u2011the\u2011counter market or on exchanges. There are futures contracts on various types carbon offsets, many of which allow physical delivery of the offsets at settlement. The market is global and has grown to $2 billion as of 2022, with projections valuing the market at upwards of $10 billion by 2030.\n\n\nOffsets are a popular tool that companies use to reduce their net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and live up to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, as well as promises to consumers. By purchasing carbon offsets, businesses are typically financing renewable energy projects that remove GHG emissions from the atmosphere or avoid GHG emissions \u2013 such as commitments to preserve forests or the construction of facilities to capture carbon emissions \u2013 without being involved directly in these projects.\n\n\nDouble Regulation of Carbon Offset Markets and Related Environmental Claims\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFor the first time since 2012, the FTC is evaluating potential updates to its Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims (Green Guides or Guides) to provide clarity to marketers labeling products or making environmental claims, including stricter guidance for marketing claims made in connection with carbon offsets.[1](#_edn1) The proposed update seeks to add more teeth to the guidance by addressing how companies link their use of offsets to claims that products or businesses are carbon-neutral, have net\u2011zero emissions, or are low\u2011carbon or carbon-negative.[2](#_edn2) Because the Guides provide the definitive interpretation of how the FTC will exercise its broad statutory authority over unfair and deceptive practices with respect to environmental claims, failure to follow the Guides may result in an increased risk of enforcement by both the FTC and its counterpart state regulators.\n\n\nThe update to the Green Guides is happening at the same time as several actions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) signifying its increased focus on environmental markets. **Historically viewed as a futures and swaps regulator, the CFTC also has jurisdiction to bring enforcement actions for fraud and manipulation in physical commodity markets. The CFTC has turned that jurisdictional focus to environmental markets.**\n\n\nNew Environmental Fraud Task Force: Watch for Increased Enforcement\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe CFTC recently created an Environmental Fraud Task Force to scrutinize fraud and other misconduct in regulated and voluntary carbon markets. The task force will examine, among other things, fraud with respect to the purported environmental benefits of purchased carbon offsets, as well as registrants' material misrepresentations regarding ESG products or strategies.\n\n\nThe CFTC also issued a whistleblower alert seeking tips related to misconduct in carbon markets. The CFTC's whistleblower program offers a monetary reward, not only to the victim of the fraud, but also to company insiders and any other market participant who voluntarily provides information about violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or CFTC regulations that lead to successful enforcement.\n\n\nThe Environmental Fraud Task Force will use the whistleblower alert as a tool to gather information to bring cases. In particular, the CFTC is interested in:\n\n\n* manipulative and wash trading or other violations of the CEA in carbon market futures contracts\n* fraud in the underlying spot markets related to ghost (illusory) carbon offsets listed on carbon market registries\n* double counting or other fraud related to carbon offsets\n* fraudulent statements relating to material terms of the carbon offset\n* manipulation of tokenized carbon markets\n\n\nThe CEA gives the CFTC the far\u2011reaching authority to pursue enforcement against \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in connection with \"a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce,\" regardless of a business' intent.[3](#_edn3) And the characterizations of double counting and fraud in the whistleblower alert are incredibly broad. Under these descriptions, **the CFTC could potentially bring enforcement actions outside of the trading context**. For example, the CFTC could prosecute a project developer that uses deceptive claims in marketing offsets or a company that markets cargos of \"carbon-neutral\" crude oil. To avoid potential enforcement by both the CFTC and the FTC, businesses will need to be careful in structuring not only their trades in carbon offsets, but also in crafting their project documentation and in making marketing claims related to their use of carbon markets to offset their emissions.\n\n\nDouble Enforcement?\n-------------------\n\n\n**Could both the FTC and the CFTC bring separate enforcement actions against a company for the same underlying fact pattern involving fraud in carbon markets? Right now, without further guidance from either agency, the answer is yes.**[4](#_edn4) Comments to the Green Guides illustrate that businesses are concerned about the possibility of double enforcement and recommend that the FTC consult with the CFTC and other agencies asserting jurisdiction over carbon markets.\n\n\nBelow is a nonexclusive list of interrelated potential problems with carbon offsets that may lead to enforcement actions by the FTC or CFTC or both:\n\n\n* **Fraudulent Claims that Offsets Are \"Additional.\"** \"Additionality\" refers to the guarantee that a business' use of carbon offsets leads to carbon reduction actually occurring in addition to any reductions that would have occurred in a business-as-usual scenario or as required by law. Several commenters in response to the FTC's proposed update of the Green Guides responded in favor of requiring that parties using offsets demonstrate additionality, and the CFTC's whistleblower alert specifies that a fraudulent or deceptive claim about additionality in the material terms of a carbon offset constitutes misconduct that could lead to enforcement. Parties using offsets should take care to understand the actual carbon reduction or removal linked to the offset and ensure that the reduction or removal is \"additional.\"\n* **Double Counting and Ghost Credits.** The CFTC has stated that it is examining fraud in the underlying spot markets related to \"ghost credits\" (illusory offsets), as well as double counting of offsets (when the same offset is claimed by more than one entity without an additional carbon benefit). Ghost credits and double counting exist because there is currently no legal requirement that companies verify the quality of offsets used to make climate claims, although many parties are currently voluntarily verifying through bodies such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM). Comments to the Guides supported the idea that verification of the quality of offsets should be required for their use. Likewise, entities have suggested that the CFTC create a registration framework for offsets, offset registries and offset brokers and conduct greater oversight of the existing registries; however, it is not clear that these actions are within the CFTC's authority. Companies should be careful not to make marketing claims about the use of offsets to create a \"net\u2011zero\" supply chain, for example, before verifying that the offsets exist and are not being double-counted.\n* **Fraudulent Claims Related to Sustainability and ESG.** The CFTC and FTC could both potentially bring an enforcement action based on a company's fraudulent use of offsets to create a \"sustainable\" business in line with its ESG goals. The FTC asked whether it should provide specific guidance on the use of \"sustainability\" or \"sustainable\" claims, given that Guides do not currently define the terms. In response, commenters criticized some companies' current use of offsets to substantiate misleading sustainable or net\u2011zero claims. Similarly, the CFTC's new Environmental Fraud Task force will specifically look for \"material misrepresentations regarding ESG products or strategies.\"[5](#_edn5) It is difficult for companies to know when statements about sustainability and ESG in relation to carbon offset trading, projects or marketing are fraudulent because the terms are not currently defined in the Guides or by the CFTC.\n\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n\nThe CFTC has limited resources, and the actions discussed above signify that carbon markets are an area of increased focus for the CFTC. As agency enforcement in carbon markets develops alongside the markets themselves, businesses will face increasing challenges when both trading in carbon offsets and making advertising claims based on the use of offsets. We anticipate that actions of the FTC and CFTC, among other agencies, will overlap in the carbon market space. Agency authority over carbon markets has not yet been tested in courts, although it is expected that these challenges are coming.\n\n\nIn the meantime, businesses will need to comply with agency actions concerning carbon markets to avoid adverse enforcement consequences.

Credit: Richard Whitcombe via Shutterstock\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon market (VCM) is a decentralised global market in which individuals and corporations can opt-in to buying and selling carbon credits, representing some form of environmental or climate action. The VCM first began in the 1990s, but only really took off towards the end of the last decade, as companies increasingly seek to align themselves with tightening national and global emissions reduction targets, as well as addressing a growing public demand for action against climate change.\n\n\nOften climate credits are bought by companies with emissions offsets in mind, enabling polluters such as non-renewable power plants to balance their emissions for \u201cnet zero\u201d. These come largely from carbon sequestration projects, such as reforestation, mangrove swamp restoration, or engineered carbon removal facilities. Some come from biodiversity projects or social programmes.\n\n\n ### Recommended Reports\n\n* ![ReportsLogo](https://pr-fr-json-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/pharmaceutical-technology/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/report.png)[Reports](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/)#### [Environment Sustainability in Power: Ethylene Co-Polymer Pv Modules](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/ethylene-co-polymer-pv-modules-environment-sustainability-in-power-innovation-and-trend-analysis?scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n[GlobalData](https://www.globaldata.com/)\n* ![ReportsLogo](https://pr-fr-json-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/pharmaceutical-technology/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/report.png)[Reports](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/)#### [China Waste to Energy Market Summary, Competitive Analysis and Forecast to 2027](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/china-waste-to-energy-market-analysis?scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n[GlobalData](https://www.globaldata.com/)\n\n [View all](https://www.globaldata.com/store/industry/power-market/)### Companies Intelligence\n\n#### [Shell plc](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1543695&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n#### [BP Plc](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1375079&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n#### [Chevron Corp](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1544307&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n#### [easyJet Plc](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1013936&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n#### [Gucci](https://www.globaldata.com/store/?s=Gucci&scalar=true&searchKeyName=companyname&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n[View all](https://www.globaldata.com/companies/)\nAt their core, voluntary carbon credits are a way for corporations to offset difficult-to-decarbonise emissions, and to signal a level of movement against climate change. However, exactly what this movement entails can be vague or undefined, because taxonomies and regulation within the VCM remain lax. \u201cCurrently, there are over 170 different ways to generate a carbon credit,\u201d Luke Leslie, CEO and co-founder of carbon credits supplier [Carbon Neutral Royalty](https://www.carbonneutralltd.com/), told *Future Power Technology.* The variety of carbon credits range drastically from \u201chigh-integrity\u201d projects with genuine environmental effect, to those with little or no impact. These categories, Leslie says, \u201care fast evolving\u201d.\n\n\nHere lies the crux of the debate. While some organisations hail carbon credits as an authentic method of decarbonisation, a necessary addition to corporations\u2019 journeys to net zero, other groups argue that they are ultimately a [scam](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/50689/carbon-offsets-net-zero-greenwashing-scam/), giving companies an easy but ineffective alternative to reducing their own emissions. So which is it, and how might changing regulations affect the VCM landscape?\n\n\nLax regulation breeds \u201cworthless\u201d offsets\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nAlready this year, several scandals relating to corporate misuse of carbon credits have made headlines. Two in particular have stuck out. The first came in mid-January when a [joint investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) by the UK\u2019s *The* *Guardian,* Germany\u2019s *Die Zeit* and online climate reporters *SourceMaterial* revealed that more than 90% of rainforest offsets offered by Verra, the world\u2019s leading carbon credits certifier, were likely to be \u201cphantom credits\u201d and did not represent genuine emissions reductions. Multinationals including Disney, [Shell](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1543695&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21), [BP](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1375079&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21), [easyJet](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1013936&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21), Leon, and Gucci used Verra\u2019s credits to earn low-carbon branding for their goods. Now, it seems that these labels were never truly earned.\n\n\nSpecifically, the investigation found that only a handful of Verra\u2019s rainforest projects showed evidence of tangible deforestation reductions, with further analysis suggesting that 94% of the credits sold to companies had no benefit regarding climate change. In at least one of Verra\u2019s carbon offsetting projects, human rights violations were a serious concern. On a visit to a major project in Peru, journalists at *The* *Guardian* were shown videos that residents said depicted their homes being destroyed with chainsaws and ropes by guards and police working alongside carbon credit companies. Local people also described forced evictions from their homes.\n\n\nVera criticised the investigation\u2019s methodology and said the conclusions drawn were \u201cincorrect\u201d. The company also said that since 2009, its work has enabled billions of dollars to be put into forest preservation and restoration.\n\n\nChevron using \u201cjunk\u201d carbon credits\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nThen in mid-May, [a study](https://corporateaccountability.org/resources/chevrons-junk-agenda-report/) looking at oil giant [Chevron](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1544307&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\u2019s use of carbon offsets made headlines. The report, titled *\u201cDestruction is at the* *heart of everything we do\u201d,* came from NGO watchdog Corporate Accountability. It found that 93% of Chevron\u2019s carbon credits, purchased through the VCM to offset some of its own substantial emissions, \u201cseem to be worthless\u201d or actively harm communities. Both its natural and engineered carbon removal projects are either \u201cjunk\u201d, contributing nothing to emissions reductions, or severely underperforming, sometimes missing targets by 50%. The study found that 42% of the company\u2019s offset schemes are linked to claims of local community abuse or environmental degradation, and could be further fuelling climate breakdown.\n\n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for Chevron challenged the report\u2019s conclusions. \u201cThe cited report is biased against our industry and paints an incomplete picture of Chevron\u2019s efforts to advance a lower carbon future,\u201d external affairs adviser Bill Turenne said in an email to [*Offshore Technology*](https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/chevron-carbon-offsets-junk-or-harmful/#catfish). \u201cChevron supports offsets as part of that effort and views them as an important market-based approach to efficient carbon reductions.\u201d Turenne added that \u201cthe majority\u201d of the credits referred to in the study are \u201ccompliance-grade\u201d and accepted by the governments in the regions where the company operates.\n\n\nDespite recent scandal, properly selected and well-calculated carbon credits are considered to be a useful tool in funding climate change mitigation projects. The UK\u2019s independent climate advisory body the [Climate Change Committee](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/voluntary-carbon-markets-and-offsetting/#:~:text=Voluntary%20carbon%20markets%20are%20markets,to%20'offset'%20their%20emissions.) encourages the use of \u201chigh-integrity\u201d nature-based and biological credits by businesses as an additional means of climate action, although it states that even top-quality credits can play but a \u201csmall role\u201d in the transition to net zero.\n\n\n\u201cMaking carbon market buyers a bit more careful\u201d\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn January, on the same day as the publication of the Verra investigation, Nat Keohane, president of the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions in the US, told [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/carbon-markets-credits-offsets-deforestation-aoe): \u201cWe need to use every channel we can for funding\u2026 We can\u2019t leave anything on the table. We know that we will not be able to meet even 2\u00b0C if we do not end tropical deforestation,\u201d but reiterated that carbon credits \u201cshould be complimentary, not a substitute\u201d for cutting emissions.\n\n\nWhen asked about the possible effects of bad press on the VCM as a whole, Leslie said that he sees the scrutiny as a \u201cpositive\u201d. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is much more attention from the media on the VCM, and this is all part of the VCM\u2019s growing pains,\u201d he says. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s just pausing immediate decisions and it\u2019s making buyers a bit more careful about what they buy, making sure that they do their own their own diligence.\n\n\n\u201cThings need to continue improving quickly in order to for the VCM to scale up,\u201d he adds, explaining that scrutiny is \u201cneeded\u201d so that improvements can be made to the methodologies used to calculate a carbon credit\u2019s worth. \u201cAnd you can see these methodologies getting updated all the time,\u201d he reassures, but concedes that stories of worthless or harmful carbon offsets \u201care not great, reputationally\u201d for the VCM.\n\n\n\u201cI think in the short-term it does shake a market that is fragile, but it\u2019s a difficult one. You always need to have this scrutiny in order for change to accelerate. The way that the VCM operates today needs to be improved.\u201d\n\n\nThe turning of the tide\n-----------------------\n\n\nIn the middle of July something did happen: the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMII), an international non-profit organisation that defines standards for carbon credit trading, published an updated [code of practice](https://vcmintegrity.org/vcmi-claims-code-of-practice/) setting out rules on how to use carbon credits in ways that accelerate climate change mitigation.\n\n\nThe new code, developed through a multi-organisational collaborative process with stakeholders, provides recommendations and guidance to corporations and other non-state actors on how they can credibly use carbon credits to make genuine environmental claims, and what specifically these claims can be. The rules aim to set a global standardised method for assessing the quality of corporate environmental claims, in an effort to stave off accusations of greenwashing and salvage the VCM\u2019s reputation. The code also advises companies looking to purchase \u201chigh-integrity\u201d credits to do so from another standards body, the [Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market](https://icvcm.org/), which is due to publish its own guidelines on what makes a \u201cquality\u201d credit soon.\n\n\nPerhaps most significant is the code\u2019s official recommendation that companies stop claiming that carbon credits offset, or \u201ccancel out\u201d, their own emissions. Instead, it suggests that credits should only be used to contribute to climate change mitigation as an additional step to an organisation\u2019s own direct emissions reductions. It also states that these reductions should be clearly and transparently disclosed on an annual basis to show, in scientific terms, how they meet targets that align with the Paris Agreement.\n\n\nThe VCMII\u2019s new recommendations shake the foundations upon which carbon credits were built. Currently, they are used overwhelmingly by organisations to make emissions-based environmental claims, to claim \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d while still polluting. \u201cIt could have quite a few ripple effects within the VCM,\u201d Leslie says.\n\n\nEnabling carbon markets to scale up\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\u201cIt should be positive because what [the VCMII] is saying is: \u2018you can\u2019t use this for compensation claims, but you can use it for beyond-value contribution claims\u2019. Companies are nervous about buying a credit and making an [environmental] claim and then getting attacked for it. If you remove that ability to be criticized, then it may mobilise more buyers and more demand.\u201d In other words, clarifying the intended use of carbon credits could remove the possibility of backlash making an enticing, risk-free prospect for companies.\n\n\n\u201cBut the other effect which we\u2019re still working through is: what does this mean in terms of the type of carbon credit that buyers buy? Because if it\u2019s not to offset, if it\u2019s just a contribution, well, does that mean the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals are going to become more important? Does it mean there will be more of a focus on biodiversity? What we need to see now is more guidance on how these framework-setters intend these new claims to operate. We can then take a view on what that means from a demand perspective.\u201d\n\n\nTightening taxonomies and regulations, in theory, leaves less room for dishonesty, making scandal less common and greenwashing more difficult. More clear and precise methodologies for calculating the value of a carbon credit will also aid companies in navigating their way to authentic environmental credentials. According to Leslie, the voluntary market still needs to grow \u201cby about a hundred times what it is today\u201d. If the VCM is here not just to stay, but also to scale up, regulatory frameworks will have to keep improving to guarantee corporate responsibility and ensure corporate accountability. Leslie concludes: \u201cWe want to see this happening much faster than it is.\u201d\n\n\n \n\n\n \nShare this

One such idea is \u201cgreen capitalism\u201d in the form of carbon markets.\n\n\nCarbon trading was officially adopted by 192 countries with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The idea is that trading the right to emit greenhouse gases means that emissions can be controlled and reduced using financial markets.\n\n\nBy producing a new commodity, \u201ccarbon credits,\u201d greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced.\n\n\nIn global carbon trading, money can be transferred away from rich polluting companies, where reductions in carbon emissions is thought to be costly, to poor countries, where carbon can supposedly be more inexpensively captured, thus resulting in a global transfer of wealth, and a reduction in carbon in one fell swoop.\n\n\nThis is the \u201cClean Development Mechanism\u201d of the protocol that came into effect in 2007, one of three forms of market that the protocol established.\n\n\nSince then a zoo of carbon markets has opened up, dealing with different jurisdictions, sectors or instruments. All rely on the trading of carbon credits, where one credit is a permit to release greenhouse gases equivalent to one ton of carbon dioxide.\n\n\nThe report by the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP, a intergovernmental forum) on carbon markets explains that emissions trading now operates in countries responsible for 55 per cent of global GDP (although covers just 17 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions), and that they \u201craised $161 billion globally as of the end of 2021.\u201d A bit less, but of a similar order of magnitude as the global market for cosmetics, or eggs.\n\n\nCarbon credits are tied to a physical process. Each carbon credit corresponds to real gases (not) being released into the atmosphere, and as such the price should reflect the real cost to make that (not) happen \u2014 unlike, for example, the value of a brand name.\n\n\nBut they are an artificial commodity thought up by committee, rather than one that has emerged from pre-existing markets: by construction, the only use of the credits is for legal or \u201cjustified\u201d pollution, and more strikingly, the non-release of hypothetical carbon requires various accounting schemes based on imagined alternative realities.\n\n\nMany of the carbon markets are \u201ccap and trade schemes.\u201d In these, jurisdictions like the EU or China decide a cap on the total carbon that can be emitted by industries. In practice, this limit covers aviation and industries like the manufacture of steel, glass, concrete, aluminium and paper.\n\n\nCredits for this pollution are distributed (generally for free) to the companies that will do the polluting. These companies must then keep their emissions below the credits they have, or buy more credits traded from other members of the scheme. The overall cap should then decrease over time.\n\n\nThe cap and distribution of credits is generous and subject to intense lobbying from polluting industries. In principle they are fined for emitting beyond the credits they hold, or buy, but in practice they often receive governmental bailouts to buy those credits if they get into trouble.\n\n\nFor example Tata and Jingye\u2019s British steel-manufacturing branches were handed millions of pounds to buy additional carbon credits to account for pollution they had already produced.\n\n\nThe other major form of carbon market is the voluntary carbon market. This is where individuals or companies outside of heavy-industry choose to contribute to buy carbon credits. These markets operate through investment in carbon-reduction projects. Voluntary carbon markets are estimated to be worth $2bn and growing.\n\n\nAlthough the cap-and-trade mechanisms are constructed so that the overall limit of carbon emitted in one jurisdiction must decrease, the Clean Development Mechanism and the voluntary markets are designed to allow rich countries and companies to continue emitting, and to outsource the reduction in emissions to poorer countries and companies.\n\n\nThis has been criticised for being neocolonial, ineffective, and for resulting in profiteering rather than actually reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\nThe question of whether the carbon credits themselves correspond to real reduction in pollution is important. Has financialisation brought a meaningful change, or is it merely a distraction?\n\n\nThere are many ways that carbon can be prevented from entering the atmosphere: projects promise filters in chimneys, carbon capture, burning biomass and sequestering it\u2026 This makes the accountancy of all the hypotheticals working out the meaning of carbon credit schemes very complex.\n\n\nMuch of the money that a carbon credit costs is required to pay an accrediting organisation for calculation and verifying projects. There are many such accrediting organisations, each with their own scheme (such as The Gold Standard or the Carbon Social Standard).\n\n\nCarbon credits can also be justified by removing carbon through storing in soil, water or burying it underground. Biomass proponents claim that they could capture carbon produced from burning plantation trees for power, and bury it underground so that it won\u2019t be released as greenhouse gases.\n\n\nSome biomass projects have big questions over them. For example, Drax runs a biomass power station in North Yorkshire which was accused by BBC Panorama of burning natural-growth Canadian forests.\n\n\nDrax made profits of \u00a3731m in 2022 and is heavily subsidised by the British government as a \u201cbioenergy firm\u201d \u2014 but although it intends to start saving and sequestering carbon in the future, that hasn\u2019t started yet.\n\n\nHowever, the most popular carbon offset projects in the voluntary markets are rainforest protection schemes.\n\n\nMoney spent on these credits is supposed to protect pristine forest from destruction or allow it to grow back. This requires projecting where and how rainforest is likely to be destroyed, and then reducing that destruction, a task full of the challenge of hypothetical situations.\n\n\nThe largest of the accreditors for these schemes is Verra. At the beginning of 2023 a large study found that unfortunately, the credits verified by Verra are worthless.

But it\u2019s not sedans and SUVs that are steering India\u2019s transition to electric mobility. \u201cWe are rooted in two-wheelers and three-wheelers \u2014 these are the two ways in which India really commutes,\u201d **Anup Jain** of Mumbai-based Orios Venture Partners tells ImpactAlpha contributor **Shefali Anand** in Delhi. Investors are pumping capital into India's e-mobility transition, helping startups in the sector raise more than $1.6 billion last year, more than double the total in 2021. **Ola Electric**, launched by ride-hailing platform Ola, has raised $1.2 billion to make electric scooters. E-scooter maker **Ather Energy** raised debt and equity in multiple rounds last year. In March, **International Finance Corp.** invested $70 million in **Mahindra's** newLast Mile Mobility company to ramp up electric three-wheeler and small commercial EV production. EV infrastructure is also popular: **Battery Smart** operates a battery-swapping network, while **Electric Pe** is building an electric charging platform. \u201cWe are at the cusp of takeoff,\u201d says **Arpit Agarwal** of Blume Ventures, an investor in both Battery Smart and Electric Pe.\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Dealflow: Climate Tech\n\n\n\n**Direct-air carbon capture gets a boost from federal funding \u2013 and Occidental Petroleum.** Calgary-based **Carbon Engineering** scored one of the first blockbuster exists in climate tech \u2013\u00a0by selling out to Big Oil. Houston-based Occidental\u2019s $1.1 billion acquisition reflects the oil industry\u2019s growing interest in direct air capture, or DAC, both to generate new revenue streams from selling carbon removal credits to other corporations, and to use the captured carbon to extract more oil, a process called \"enhanced oil recovery.\" Oil producers have been the biggest buyers of captured carbon and have coined the controversial term \u201cnet-zero oil.\u201d Occidental, backed by **Warren Buffett**, has had a four-year partnership with Carbon Engineering, whose investors include Buffett\u2019s old friend, **Bill Gates**. \u201cWe believe using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery and generating net-zero barrels is the way,\u201d Occidental\u2019s **Vicki Hollub** told Bloomberg last year. \u201cThe last company standing that produces the last barrel of oil should do so from CO2-enhanced oil recovery.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Impact Voices: Patient Capital\n\n\n\n**In India, \u2018zebra\u2019 companies deliver impact at scale and exits for investors.** An investor in India looking for quick 10x returns might have missed ambulance company **Ziqitza Healthcare**, clean cookstove firm **Greenway Grameen**, and affordable housing financier **Sitara**. The companies are delivering tangible impact for tens of millions of very low-income people. Last year, each delivered an exit for **Acumen India**, which has invested more than $35 million in 33 companies since 2004. The exits returned three times Acumen\u2019s initial investment. The successful, if slow, exits suggest that VCs in the country may be focusing too much \u201chigh, quick returns\u201d from investments in unicorns, Acumen\u2019s **Mahesh Yagnaraman** argues in a guest post. Moderate-growth zebras, he says, \u201chave immense potential to solve problems of poverty, but require more time and a greater tolerance to risk.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Agents of Impact: Follow the Talent\n\n\n\n**Marc Becker**, former co-head of impact investing at Apollo Global Management, passed away on Monday this week.

Yet the vast continent of nearly 1.5 billion people attracts just $30 billion, or about 2% of global climate funding. \n\n *One promising source of climate financing:* the $2 billion global market for voluntary carbon credits. \n\n Carbon credits have been criticized for greenwashing and poor quality projects, but African leaders see an opportunity to boost oversight and fund sustainable development. Kenya\u2019s President **William Ruto** has called carbon credits Kenya\u2019s \u201cnext significant export.\u201d \n\n The Carbon Credit and Benefit Sharing bill, now making its way through Kenya\u2019s parliament, splits carbon proceeds among project owners, local and national\u00a0governments and communities. A project in a community forest, for example, would channel 55% of proceeds to communities, 25% to national governments, and 15% to county governments. Another bill, the Climate Change Amendment, regulates trading and engagement in carbon markets. \n\n Ruto helped launch the [Africa Carbon Markets Initiative](https://www.energyalliance.org/news-insights/acmi-adsw/) at last year\u2019s COP27 in Egypt to help African nations unlock up to $120 billion from carbon markets and create more than 110 million jobs by 2050. The world has \u201ca golden opportunity,\u201d Ruto [said](https://www.energyalliance.org/news-insights/acmi-adsw/), to develop carbon markets that \u201ccan yield attractive income and development opportunities for communities at the frontlines in the fight against climate change.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n ### **Everyone in**\n\n Malawi launched an initiative in June to regulate carbon projects on its land and ensure that the government and local communities benefit. In May, Zimbabwe abruptly declared that it would take a 50% cut of all carbon projects. \n\n One of the largest and earliest forest conservation projects, the Kariba Project in Zimbabwe, was the subject of a July [investigation](https://www.ftm.eu/articles/renowed-carbon-credit-project-lacks-transparancy?share=cHi%2Fzsg0VVHEU%2FC4vV5bIUY%2FqxdsVZCK%2Fe2vpM9ckaHSyufCO%2FHmMhz993lGPbM%3D) by *Follow The Money* that found that communities received very little from the $100 million generated from the sale of credits to buyers like Gucci and Volkswagen.\u00a0\n\n ### **Carbon capture**\n\n Kenya issued more than 20% of all carbon credits in Africa between 2016 and 2021. The nation has the potential to mobilize up to $600 million per year by 2030, based on an average price of $20 per ton, according to the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative. That would require it to generate credits from a broader range of projects.\n\n Nairobi-based direct air capture startup Octavia Carbon is working with New York-based Cella Mineral Storage to remove carbon from the air and store it in mineral rock in Kenya\u2019s Great Rift Valley.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n ###### \nGuest Author\n\n #### Lucy Ngige\n\n  ###### \nImpactAlpha Editor\n\n #### Amy Cortese\n\n   ###### August 17, 2023\n\n ### The Brief\n\n ##### Featured: Electric Vehicles\n\n **Small vehicles have investors thinking big about India's e-mobility transition.** American electric car makers like **Tesla** are touting plans to bring their cars to India. But it\u2019s not sedans and SUVs that are steering India\u2019s transition to electric mobility. \u201cWe are rooted in two-wheelers and three-wheelers \u2014 these are the two ways in which India really commutes,\u201d **Anup Jain** of Mumbai-based Orios Venture Partners tells ImpactAlpha contributor **Shefali Anand** in Delhi. Investors are pumping capital into India's e-mobility transition, helping startups in the sector raise more than $1.6 billion last year, more than double the total in 2021. **Ola Electric**, launched by ride-hailing platform Ola, has raised $1.2 billion to make electric scooters. E-scooter maker **Ather Energy** raised debt and equity in multiple rounds last year.

Picture this: A permit granting countries and organizations a set carbon emission limit. But here\u2019s where it gets intriguing \u2013 if they don\u2019t use up their allowance, they can trade it. Imagine a company selling its unused emissions to another that\u2019s gone overboard their emission limits. In simple words, carbon credits grant organizations the right to emit a certain amount of CO2 annually, acting as a regulatory framework which allows countries to stay within their emission control goals.\n\n\n**Emission trading systems**\n\n\nCarbon markets mainly fall into two types: Compliance and voluntary. Compliance markets emerge due to the presence of national, regional and/or global policies or regulatory obligations. These are obligatory responsibilities that businesses must meet. Voluntary carbon markets, both at the national and international levels, refer to the voluntary trading, purchasing and selling of carbon credits. The current supply of voluntary carbon credits comes mostly from private organizations that develop carbon projects, or governments with certified programs that reduce emissions and/or removals.\n\n\nDemand is generated by businesses with sustainability goals, private individuals looking to offset their carbon footprints and other parties looking to profit by trading credits. One of the first tradable emission offset mechanisms is the 1997 US Clean Air Act. This act enabled a permitted facility to increase emissions if it compensated by paying another company to cut emissions by an equal or greater amount.\n\n\nThis act laid the groundwork for a mesmerizing dance of emission trading that echoes across subnational, national, and international stages. In 2023, under India\u2019s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, entities exceeding emission limits now face a choice: Pay a penalty or embrace responsible practices. Programs like California\u2019s Cap Trade Program cover about 85 percent of statewide GHG emissions. One of the biggest emission trading systems is the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS), which witnessed emission allowances from \u20ac12.4 per ton by the end of 2010 to a jaw-dropping \u20ac100.3 per metric ton of CO? by 2023.\n\n\n[![](https://www.kuwaittimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20002-300x297.jpeg)](https://www.kuwaittimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20002.jpeg)**Nadine Mustafa**\n**Carbon offset schemes for carbon credit**\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about carbon offset schemes \u2014 these schemes are programs which produce credits in exchange for funding programs that offset carbon emissions. Carbon credits and offsets are produced from diverse projects like fuel switching, energy efficiency, reforestation and renewable energy. In practice, a developed country can fund a greenhouse gas reduction project in a developing country. As a result, the developed country receives credit for achieving its carbon reduction goals, while the developing country receives funding for projects, technologies or a favorable change in land use. This falls under the Clean Development Mechanism, a UN-administered carbon offset initiative. CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for Inte\n\n\nrnational Aviation, represents a global initiative aimed at limiting international aviation emissions, which also establishes a framework for generating credits and offsets on a global scale. The REDD+ program is another international program that aims to monetize landowners to refrain from deforestation or degradation. In doing so, the program fosters a collaborative balance between conservation and compensation. Dr Nadine Moustafa, a PhD researcher specializing in carbon capture technologies, said: \u201cShould Kuwait embark on implementing such a scheme, it must brace itself for an ongoing and vigilant monitoring process.\n\n\nEmbracing an emissions trading scheme becomes especially pivotal if Kuwait intends to embrace industrial innovation, championing technologies like carbon capture and storage.\u201d Some carbon markets are implementing blockchain technology for processes like tracking carbon credit transactions or monitoring, reporting and verification. This can improve the auditability of emission-reduction project data, streamlining verification processes, thus reducing transaction costs and enhancing trust among market participants, according to the World bank.\n\n\n**Value of Credits**\n\n\nHow are the carbon credits valued? How can we ensure the quality of a carbon credit? How do we determine the value of a carbon credit produced by a carbon offset program? We will all answer it here. A number of factors can affect the prices of the value of the credits produced in an offset program. Project development costs and certification from a respected organization, projects that absorb CO2 and projects with added social and environmental advantages can all command a higher price. Carbon credits with older vintages tend to be valued lower on the market. The vintage is the year in which the carbon emissions reduction project generates the carbon offset credit. Certification programs are a key component of this community. In 2022, voluntary carbon market prices ranged from $8 to $30 per ton of CO2 for the most common types of offset projects.\n\n\n**Risks of the current market**\n\n\nDr Moustafa also informed Kuwait Times about potential drawbacks and uncertainties such as carbon leakage, overallocation of credits, lack of additionality and inaccurate emission accounting. She added it is important to note that these risks can be managed and mitigated through proper design and transparency.\n\n\n **Carbon credit for Kuwait**\n\n\nKuwait has huge potential to implement this into their system in the future, according to Shariq Ahmed, who works as an HSE Specialist in a Kuwait petroleum company. \u201cSeveral factors could influence the implementation and success of carbon credits or an emission trading system, as Kuwait\u2019s economy profoundly depend on oil exports, and the oil industry is a major supplier to its carbon emissions.\n\n\nThe availability of technologies for monitoring and reporting emissions is important for an effective ETS or carbon credit system. Precise measurement is necessary to ensure the integrity of emission reductions,\u201d he said. Kuwait Finance House supported the first carbon offset platform in 2021. Its aim was to mitigate carbon emissions by increasing tree plantings and starting new environmental projects. But Kuwait has still not established a proper emissions trading system.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Carbon credits grant organizations the right to emit a certain amount of CO2 annually, acting as a regulatory framework which allows countries to stay within their emission control goals.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article presents carbon credits as a regulatory framework that helps countries meet emission control goals, suggesting a positive impact on reducing carbon emissions."}, {"summary": "Compliance and voluntary carbon markets exist, with compliance markets being obligatory responsibilities and voluntary markets involving the trading of carbon credits.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The information provided does not inherently suggest a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Emission trading systems have been established in various regions, such as India and the European Union, to enforce emission limits and create incentives for responsible practices.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The existence of emission trading systems implies a positive effort to control emissions and incentivize responsible practices."}, {"summary": "Carbon offset schemes allow developed countries to fund greenhouse gas reduction projects in developing countries in exchange for credits that count towards their own emission reduction goals.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Carbon offset schemes create a collaborative balance between conservation and compensation, providing funding for projects while achieving emission reduction goals."}, {"summary": "Implementing an emissions trading scheme can be pivotal for Kuwait's industrial innovation and adoption of technologies like carbon capture and storage.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article suggests that implementing an emissions trading scheme can support industrial innovation and the adoption of carbon capture and storage technologies, indicating a positive outlook."}, {"summary": "The value of carbon credits can be influenced by project development costs, certification, CO2 absorption, and social and environmental benefits.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The information provided does not inherently suggest a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Potential drawbacks and uncertainties in the current market include carbon leakage, overallocation of credits, lack of additionality, and inaccurate emission accounting, which can be managed through proper design and transparency.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The information provided does not inherently suggest a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Kuwait has the potential to implement carbon credits or an emissions trading system in the future, but challenges include its dependence on oil exports and the need for technologies to monitor and report emissions accurately.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The information provided does not inherently suggest a positive or negative sentiment."}], "semantic_commentary": "Commentary: Carbon credits can help organizations reduce emissions and meet goals.", "sentiment_score": 0.5, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions carbon offset schemes, carbon credits, emission trading systems, and carbon capture and storage technologies."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions countries enforcing emission limits and creating incentives for responsible practices."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article discusses the current market, potential drawbacks, uncertainties, challenges, and the need for technologies to monitor and report emissions accurately."}]}, {"source": "GlobeNewswire", "link": "https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/16/2726216/0/en/NFI-Announces-Second-Quarter-2023-Results-and-Update-on-Comprehensive-Refinancing-Plan.html", "title": "NFI Announces Second Quarter 2023 Results and Update on", "content": "\nAll figures quoted in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted:  \n\n\n * **2023 Q2 revenue of** **$660** **million;** **931** **equivalent units (\"EUs\") delivered, with** **25%** **being battery- and fuel cell-electric buses (\"ZEBs\").**\n* **2023 Q2 Adjusted EBITDA****2** **of** **$12** **million;

(\"NFI\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in zero-emission electric mobility solutions, today announced its unaudited consolidated financial results for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n Key financial metrics of the quarter and for the last twelve months are highlighted below:\n\n \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| in millions except deliveries and per Share amounts | **2023 Q2** | **Change****1** | **2023 Q2 LTM** | **Change****1** |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Deliveries (EUs) |  | 931 |  | *66* | *%* |  | 3,540 |  | *16* | *%* |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| **IFRS Measures****3** |  |  |  |  |\n| Revenue | $ | 660 |  | *66* | *%* | $ | 2,381 |  | *16* | *%* |\n| Net loss |  | (48 | ) | *14* | *%* |  | (286 | ) | *(165)**%* |\n| Net loss per Share | $ | (0.62 | ) | *15* | *%* | $ | (3.70 | ) | *(157)**%* |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| **Non-IFRS Measures****2,3** |  |  |  |  |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 12 |  | *159* | *%* | $ | 0 |  | *(101)**%* |\n| Adjusted Net Loss | $ | (35 | ) | *27.1* | *%* | $ | (143 | ) | *(23.9)**%* |\n| Adjusted Net Loss per Share | $ | (0.46 | ) | *28.1* | *%* | $ | (1.86 | ) | *(16.3)**%* |\n| Free Cash Flow | $ | (31 | ) | *37* | *%* | $ | (139 | ) | *(44)**%* |\n| Liquidity (minimum liquidity requirement of $25 million) | $ | 82 |  | *(34)**%* | $ | 82 |  | *(34)**%* |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n Footnotes:\n\n 1. Results noted herein are for the 13-week period (\"2023 Q2\u201d) and the 52-week period (\"LTM 2023 Q2\u201d) ended July 2, 2023. The comparisons reported in this press release compare 2023 Q2 to the 13-week period (\"2022 Q2\") and LTM 2023 Q2 to the 53-week period (\"LTM 2022 Q2\") ended July 3, 2022. Comparisons and comments are also made to the 13-week period (\u201c2023 Q1\u201d) ended April 2, 2023. The term \"LTM\" is an abbreviation for \"Last Twelve Month Period\".\n2. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Free Cash Flow represent non-IFRS measures, Adjusted Net Loss per Share and Return on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\") are non-IFRS ratios, and Liquidity and Backlog are supplementary financial measures. Such measures and ratios are not defined terms under IFRS and do not have standard meanings, so they may not be a reliable way to compare NFI to other companies. Adjusted Net Loss per Share is based on the non-IFRS measure Adjusted Net Loss. ROIC is based on net operating profit after tax and average invested capital, both of which are non-IFRS measures. See \u201cNon-IFRS Measures\u201d and detailed reconciliations of IFRS Measures to Non-IFRS Measures in Appendix B of this press release. Readers are advised to review the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements (including notes) (the \u201cFinancial Statements\u201d) and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis (the \"MD&A\").\n3. The Company retrospectively adopted IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts on January 2, 2023. Refer to the section, \"new and amended standards adopted by the Company\" for details of the impact of the adoption. NFI's Financial Statements were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with IFRS. Readers are recommended to read the section \"capital allocation policy\" in the MD&A regarding the basis of preparation and the determination of application of the going concern assumption.\n\n \"In the second quarter of 2023, we continued to see significant improvements in supply chain performance, bus and coach deliveries, gross margins, and Adjusted EBITDA. The aftermarket segment delivered another period of outperformance, with record quarterly Adjusted EBITDA, and overall market demand remained very strong. During the quarter, we submitted our highest number of bids ever, and our quarter-end backlog reached a record $6.7 billion, with 36% of backlog being zero-emission buses and coaches, up from just 20% in the second quarter of last year.\n\n \"New contract pricing continues to improve, with the average sale price in our backlog up 20% year-over-year, and we expect to complete and deliver nearly all remaining inflation-impacted legacy contracts before the end of 2023. We maintain our plan to significantly increase new vehicle production rates in the second half of the year, a process that started in earnest towards the end of the second quarter. As we ramp-up production, we anticipate some temporary inefficiencies, but we see a path for significant margin growth in 2024 and 2025 from a combination of pricing improvements, higher delivery volumes, sales mix and enhanced operational performance.\n\n \"Our comprehensive refinancing plan is nearing completion, and we are pleased to announce an additional equity private placement of Shares for approximately $38 million, which brings our total expected gross proceeds from all transactions of the plan to $443 million. When complete, this plan will help improve our liquidity and financial flexibility, improve our leverage profile and provide appropriate covenants to support our recovery as we drive towards our goal of $400 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2025,\" said Paul Soubry, President and Chief Executive Officer, NFI.\n\n **Refinancing Plan and Liquidity**\n\n The Company continues to advance its comprehensive refinancing plan (\"Refinancing Plan\"), and today announced that as part of that plan it has entered into subscription agreements with a leading global asset manager (the \u201cInvestor\u201d) whereby certain funds managed and/or advised by the Investor have agreed to subscribe for and purchase from the Company an aggregate of 5,000,000 Shares, on a private placement basis, at a subscription price of C$10.10 per share (the \u201cSubscription Price\u201d), for aggregate gross proceeds to NFI of C$50,500,0001 (approximately $38,113,000) (the \"August Private Placement\u201d).\n\n The net proceeds from the August Private Placement will be used by the Company to repay outstanding indebtedness under NFI's existing credit facilities and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Shares to be issued in the August Private Placement will be subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities law rules. Completion of the August Private Placement is subject to customary conditions, approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\"), and is conditional upon the concurrent completion of the other elements of the Refinancing Plan.\n\n Following completion of the Refinancing Plan, NFI expects that it will have 118.9 million Shares outstanding. NFI expects to close all elements of the Refinancing Plan concurrently prior to August 31, 2023.\n\n Based on the expected proceeds from the August Private Placement, NFI intends to lower the gross proceeds from its proposed second lien debt financing from $200 million to approximately $180 million. This is expected to generate annual interest savings of up to $2.9 million per annum.\n\n Upon close of the Refinancing Plan, the Company will permanently reduce capacity under its Secured Facilities by $250 million, and receive additional liquidity of approximately $135 to $140 million as the Company will lower carrying balances on its revolving credit facilities and increase cash on-hand. A summary of the expected gross proceeds is provided below:\n\n \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Refinancing Plan Gross Proceeds** | **$ millions** | **Shares Issued(millions)** |\n| **Equity** |  |  |\n| Coliseum Private Placement | $ | 133 | *21.7* |\n| Subscription Receipts Offering | $ | 92 | *15.1* |\n| August Private Placement | $ | 38 | *5.0* |\n|  |  |  |\n| **Debt**  |  |  |\n| Second Lien Debt | $ | 180 | *N/A* |\n|  |  |  |\n| **Total Refinancing Plan Gross Proceeds** | **$** | **443** | ***41.8*** |\n|  |\n\n The Company's liquidity position, which combines cash on-hand plus available capacity under its credit facilities, without consideration given to the minimum liquidity requirement of $25 million, was $82 million as at the end of 2023 Q2, down $43 million from the end of 2023 Q1. The decrease in liquidity is primarily due to increased requirements for letters of credit (\"LOC\") and increased debt drawings to support increased worked capital levels.\n\n While NFI finalizes its Refinancing Plan, which is expected to significantly improve NFI's liquidity position, the Company is focused on cash management with expectations that working capital levels will be reduced in the second half of 2023 as the Company lowers inventory levels, collects on receivable balances and pursues advance payments and deposits from customers, wherever possible. The Company's current focus on simultaneously reducing work in progress and ramping up production puts additional stress on liquidity.\n\n To further support liquidity, subsequent to quarter-end NFI received approval under its senior credit facilities to lower the minimum liquidity requirement from $25 million to $5 million, effective as of July 31, 2023 to August 31, 2023. Post-completion of the Refinancing Plan, the minimum liquidity requirement under the senior facilities will increase to $50 million. If the Refinancing Plan is not completed by August 31, 2023, the Company will require relief from the lenders under its senior secured facilities and potentially additional liquidity support. There can be no assurance that such relief or support will be available.\n\n **Segment Results**\n\n **Manufacturing segment** revenue for 2023 Q2 increased by $238 million, or 84%, compared to 2022 Q2. The increase was driven by higher new vehicle and pre-owned coach deliveries. NFI experienced significant improvement in supplier performance and on-time production during the quarter, supporting a 66% year-over-year increase in bus and coach deliveries. While there was improvement, Quarterly and LTM deliveries are down relative to pre-COVID-19 levels due to global supply chain challenges and related production inefficiencies.\n\n Manufacturing Adjusted EBITDA increased by $26 million, or 63%, compared to 2022 Q2. The increase was driven by higher overall deliveries, favourable sales mix, and a lower number of legacy inflation-impacted contracts.\n\n **Aftermarket segment** revenue for 2023 Q2 of $138 million increased by $23 million, or 20% compared to 2022 Q2, driven by increased volume in the North America region. 2023 Q2 Aftermarket Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, a $7 million, or 33%, year-over-year increase, stemming from improved sales volume and product mix.\n\n **Net loss, Adjusted Net Loss, and Return on Invested Capital**\n\n 2023 Q2 net loss of $48 million decreased by $8 million from 2022 Q2, primarily due to higher overall deliveries, favourable sales mix, and a lower number of legacy inflation impacted contracts, offset by higher interest expense from higher carrying balances on the Company's facilities and higher interest rates.\n\n 2023 Q2 Adjusted Net Loss of $35 million compared to 2022 Q2 Adjusted Net Loss of $48 million. The decrease in Adjusted Net Loss was driven by the same items that impacted Adjusted EBITDA and net loss, with several one-time costs in 2022 related to insurance, pension and restructuring that did not repeat in 2023.\n\n LTM 2023 Q2 ROIC increased by 1% from LTM 2023 Q1, due to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA and by a lower invested capital base. The decrease in invested capital is primarily due to a decrease in shareholders' equity, partially offset by increases in long-term debt.\n\n **Outlook** \n\n NFI anticipates positive improvements to revenue, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, reduction in net loss, and improvement in ROIC as it delivers on its backlog, and benefits from record government investments in public transportation, and growing demand for its buses, coaches, parts and Infrastructure SolutionsTM services.\n\n Market demand is evident through the high volume of active bus and motor coach procurements in both North America and international markets. As of 2023 Q2, the Company's North American active bids remained high at 10,054 EUs. This bid activity is expected to drive additional backlog growth in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024. The current five-year forecasted demand within the Company's North American bid universe is also strong at 21,569 EUs, and, when combined with active bids, provides a record Total Bid Universe of 31,623 EUs.\n\n In addition to the increased numbers of bids for ZEBs, the number of EUs per bid has increased, as transit agencies are progressing from pilot or trials to more active deployment and operation of ZEB fleets. NFI expects active ZEB bids to remain high through the coming years based on strong government funding levels.\n\n While certain supply chain challenges continue, and have impacted NFI's operating and financial performance, the Company has seen signs of significant improvement in the first half of 2023. The number of moderate and high risk suppliers within NFI's supply base has decreased, and, when combined with actions taken by NFI, on-time supplier delivery performance has improved, supporting expected increases to 2023 production volumes. Higher production allows NFI to absorb less fixed overhead on a per unit basis.\n\n NFI is maintaining its plan to increase new vehicle production rates in the second half of 2023, subject to continued and sustained supply performance and anticipates it will hire approximately 100 additional direct labour team members before the end of 2023. This will be a phased approach with gradual headcount additions throughout the second half of the year driving improvements to new vehicle starts and deliveries. NFI anticipates that it will experience some temporary production inefficiencies as it ramps-up production of new vehicles.\n\n Gross margins and other profitability metrics are expected to improve as NFI increases production rates, delivers more vehicles, and completes the remaining inflation impacted legacy contracts, originally bid in 2020 and 2021, in 2023. The Company has experienced signs of inflation easing during the first half of 2023 and anticipates that newer contracts in NFI's backlog now reflect appropriate, inflation-adjusted pricing.\n\n **Financial Guidance and Targets**\n\n NFI updates its financial guidance for Fiscal 2023, including revenue of $2.6 to $2.8 billion (previous: $2.5 to $2.8 billion) and Adjusted EBITDA of $40 to $60 million (previous: $30 to $60 million); anticipated ZEBs as a percentage of manufacturing sales and cash capital expenditures remain unchanged for 2023. NFI also reaffirms its Fiscal 2024, and its 2025 targets, as presented on March 1, 2023.\n\n \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 2019 Pro-forma Results | 2023 Guidance | 2024 Guidance | 2025 Targets |\n| Revenue | $3.2 billion | **$2.6 to $2.8 billion** | $3.2 to $3.6 billion | ~$4 billion |\n| ZEBs (electric) as a percentage of manufacturing sales | 6% | 25% to 30% | 30% to 35% | ~40% |\n| Adjusted EBITDA2 | $331 million | **$40 to $60 million** | $250 to $300 million | ~$400 million |\n| Cash Capital Expenditures |  | $35 to $40 million | $50 to $60 million | ~$50 million |\n| Return on Invested Capital - provided for 2025 targets | 9.8% |  |  | >12% |\n\n   \nPlease review the Company's March 1, 2023 press release and the 2022 Q4 and Fiscal Year MD&A for details on the assumptions that drive Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2024 guidance, and 2025 targets, as well as certain applicable risks. Management's expectations regarding financial guidance and targets above are also subject to the risks and other factors referred to in Appendix B.\n\n The 2023 and 2024 guidance ranges and the 2025 targets provided above are driven by numerous expectations and assumptions including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n * **Revenue:** Anticipated revenue growth in 2023, 2024 and 2025 is based on year-to-date results, NFI's firm order backlog, current 2023 and 2024 production schedules, expected backlog option order conversion, and anticipated 2023, 2024 and 2025 new vehicle orders and aftermarket parts sales. Revenue guidance and targets reflect higher volume of ZEB sales and anticipated product mix benefits, plus expected international sales expansion. The guidance ranges also reflect potential variances in delivery volumes from supply disruption, product mix and expected timing of production recovery driving improved efficiency in the second half of 2023 and Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025.\n* **Adjusted EBITDA**: Adjusted EBITDA performance is driven by 2023 year-to-date results, anticipated recoveries in new vehicle deliveries, changes to product mix, a higher percentage of ZEB deliveries and improved operating margins, especially from the second half of 2023 onwards, due to anticipated recovery in supply chain health. While there will be some impact to margins in 2023 from legacy inflation impacted contracts, contracts secured in the second half of 2022 and in Fiscal 2023 reflect updated pricing and improved margins.\n* The ranges for ZEBs as a percentage of manufacturing sales are based on year-to-date results combined with existing firm backlog, active bids, and anticipated future orders. Cash capital expenditures are based on investments made in 2023 and expected future maintenance and growth projects.\n\n Guidance and targets above are conditional on several factors and expectations, including the recovery of supply chain performance, a higher percentage of ZEB sales (which provide a higher revenue and dollar margin benefit), the mitigation of inflationary pressures, end markets recovering in-line with management expectations, international expansion, aftermarket parts sales, continuous improvement initiatives and completion of the Refinancing Plan. There can be no assurance that the Refinancing Plan will be completed on the terms disclosed or otherwise.\n\n NFI's guidance and targets are subject to the risk of extended duration of the current supply disruptions and the risk of additional supply disruptions affecting particular key components. In addition, the guidance and targets do not reflect potential escalated impact on supply chains or other factors arising directly or indirectly as a result of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although NFI does not have direct suppliers based in Russia or Ukraine, additional supply delays and possible shortages of critical components may arise as the conflict progresses and if certain suppliers\u2019 operations and/or subcomponent supply from affected countries are disrupted further. In addition, there may also be further general industry-wide price increases for components and raw materials used in vehicle production as well as further increases in the cost of labour and potential difficulties in sourcing an increase in the supply of labour. See Appendix B Forward Looking Statements for risks and other factors and the Company's filings on SEDAR.\n\n **Environmental, Social & Governance**\n\n In May 2023, NFI released its environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") Report for 2022, which updated key performance indicators, highlights for 2022, ESG priorities for 2023, as well as some specific projects and initiatives the Company undertook in the year. The Report focuses on the three main components of NFI\u2019s Sustainability Pledge, first adopted in 2006: \u201cBetter Product. Better Workplace. Better World\u201d, which guides the Company\u2019s daily actions and long-term planning. The ESG Report for 2022 can be found at: [https://www.nfigroup.com/esg/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KHcC4kPwWzNl0ICOvauTtoODMtcFfTnCKAuYUfiWuCL5XVzYHVWfpGbpYVvG_dk8sgJ1FNS4OPRxTL3TZ6HrD2OxnZgOaucOINrLYZam0iG0uPhbbHp9V7OG1f5xw5b9)\n\n In June 2023, NFI announced that it had been ranked among Corporate Knights\u2019 Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada for the second consecutive year. The Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada highlights companies that outperform their peers in corporate sustainability leadership.\n\n **Second Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call and Filing**\n\n NFI intends to release its second quarter 2023 financial results on Wednesday, August 16, 2023, prior to market open.

However, Adjusted EBITDA and NOPAT are not recognized earnings measures under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA and NOPAT may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Readers of this press release are cautioned that Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings or loss determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company's performance and NOPAT should not be construed as an alternative to earnings or loss from operations determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company's performance. See \"Non-IFRS Measures\" for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. The following table reconciles net loss to Adjusted EBITDA based on the historical financial statements of the Company for the periods\u00a0indicated. The Company defines NOPAT as Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation of plant and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets and income taxes at a rate of 31%.\n\n \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (U.S. dollars in thousands) - unaudited | **2023 Q2** | **2022 Q2** |  |  | **52-Weeks Ended July 2, 2023** | **53-Weeks Ended July 3, 2022** |\n| Net loss | (48,101 | ) | (56,009 | ) |  |  | (285,992 | ) | (107,910 | ) |\n| Addback |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Income taxes | (8,606 | ) | (17,595 | ) |  |  | (37,249 | ) | (32,410 | ) |\n| Interest expense15 | 39,970 |  | 9,120 |  |  |  | 109,171 |  | 14,768 |  |\n| Amortization | 18,731 |  | 20,282 |  |  |  | 84,494 |  | 92,720 |  |\n| (Gain) loss on disposition of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets | 969 |  | (58 | ) |  |  | 818 |  | 25 |  |\n| Fair value adjustment for total return swap9 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | 2,335 |  |\n| Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss on non-current monetary items and forward foreign exchange contracts | 4,471 |  | 1,045 |  |  |  | (2,363 | ) | 12,968 |  |\n| Costs associated with assessing strategic and corporate initiatives7 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | (106 | ) |\n| Past service costs and other pension costs11 | \u2014 |  | 7,000 |  |  |  | 4,764 |  | 7,000 |  |\n| Proportion of the total return swap realized10 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | (1,525 | ) |\n| Equity settled stock-based compensation | 831 |  | 243 |  |  |  | 2,058 |  | 1,114 |  |\n| Unrecoverable insurance costs and other12 | \u2014 |  | 7,913 |  |  |  | 164 |  | 8,324 |  |\n| Expenses incurred outside of normal operations17 | 480 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | 5,487 |  | \u2014 |  |\n| Prior year sales tax provision 13 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | 1,996 |  |\n| COVID-19 costs14 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | 3,205 |  |\n| Out of period costs16 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | (1,597 | ) | 1,234 |  |\n| Impairment loss on goodwill18 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | 103,900 |  | \u2014 |  |\n| Restructuring costs8 | 3,433 |  | 7,435 |  |  |  | 16,183 |  | 16,462 |  |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 12,178 |  | (20,624 | ) |  |  | (162 | ) | 20,200 |  |\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets | (10,896 | ) | (12,346 | ) |  |  | (53,387 | ) | (60,350 | ) |\n| Tax at 31% | (397 | ) | 10,221 |  |  | \u2014 | 16,600 |  | 12,447 |  |\n| NOPAT | 885 |  | (22,749 | ) |  |  | (36,949 | ) | (27,703 | ) |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of: |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Manufacturing | (15,912 | ) | (42,380 | ) |  |  | (106,330 | ) | (87,353 | ) |\n| Aftermarket | 29,567 |  | 22,256 |  |  |  | 100,093 |  | 96,342 |  |\n| Corporate | (1,477 | ) | (500 | ) |  |  | 6,075 |  | 11,211 |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow per Share\n\n Management uses Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow per Share as non-IFRS measures to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating performance and liquidity and to assess the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its Shares, service debt, and meet other payment obligations. However, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow per Share are not recognized earnings measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. Accordingly, Free Cash Flow and the associated per Share figure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Readers of this press release are cautioned that Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of liquidity and cash flow. See \"Non-IFRS Measures\" for the definition of Free Cash Flow. The following table reconciles net cash generated by operating activities to Free Cash Flow.\n\n The Company defines Free Cash Flow per Share as Free Cash Flow divided by the average number of Shares outstanding.\n\n \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (U.S. dollars in thousands, except per Share figures) - unaudited | **2023 Q2** | **2022 Q2** |  |  | **52-Weeks Ended July 2, 2023** | **53-Weeks Ended July 3, 2022** |\n| Net cash generated by (used in) operating activities | (13,775 | ) | 8,440 |  |  |  | (196,551 | ) | (12,629 | ) |\n| Changes in non-cash working capital items3 | 11,284 |  | (60,802 | ) |  |  | 109,520 |  | (57,524 | ) |\n| Interest paid3 | 27,957 |  | 12,959 |  |  |  | 88,054 |  | 58,370 |  |\n| Interest expense3 | (30,112 | ) | (18,570 | ) |  |  | (99,011 | ) | (72,106 | ) |\n| Income taxes paid (recovered)3 | (19,509 | ) | 2,974 |  |  |  | (24,388 | ) | 6,079 |  |\n| Current income tax recovery (expense)3 | 53 |  | 2,824 |  |  |  | 13,452 |  | 3,105 |  |\n| Repayment of obligations under lease | (5,283 | ) | (6,029 | ) |  |  | (24,025 | ) | (18,722 | ) |\n| Cash capital expenditures | (5,089 | ) | (4,232 | ) |  |  | (19,007 | ) | (28,697 | ) |\n| Acquisition of intangible assets | (2,583 | ) | (2,214 | ) |  |  | (10,727 | ) | (5,673 | ) |\n| Proceeds from disposition of property, plant and equipment | 66 |  | 228 |  |  |  | 579 |  | 4,477 |  |\n| Costs associated with assessing strategic and corporate initiatives7 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | (106 | ) |\n| Defined benefit funding4 | 454 |  | 1,261 |  |  |  | 3,240 |  | 4,511 |  |\n| Defined benefit expense4 | (779 | ) | (1,746 | ) |  |  | (2,336 | ) | (6,735 | ) |\n| Past service costs and other pension costs11 | \u2014 |  | 7,000 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | 7,000 |  |\n| Expenses incurred outside of normal operations17 | 480 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | 5,488 |  | \u2014 |  |\n| Equity Hedge | 229 |  | (124 | ) |  |  | 42 |  | (124 | ) |\n| Proportion of the total return swap realized10 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | (1,525 | ) |\n| Unrecoverable insurance costs and other12 | \u2014 |  | 7,913 |  |  |  | 164 |  | 10,320 |  |\n| Out of period costs16 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | (1,597 | ) | 2,498 |  |\n| Restructuring costs8 | 3,433 |  | 3,627 |  |  |  | 13,228 |  | 12,492 |  |\n| COVID-19 costs14 | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | 3,217 |  |\n| Foreign exchange gain (loss) on cash held in foreign currency5 | 2,405 |  | (2,118 | ) |  |  | 4,915 |  | (4,384 | ) |\n| Free Cash Flow1 | (30,769 | ) | (48,609 | ) |  |  | (138,960 | ) | (96,156 | ) |\n| U.S. exchange rate2 | 1.3245 |  | 1.2883 |  |  |  | 1.3590 |  | 1.2710 |  |\n| Free Cash Flow (C$)1 | (40,754 | ) | (62,624 | ) |  |  | (188,847 | ) | (122,213 | ) |\n| Free Cash Flow per Share (C$)6 | (0.5281 | ) | (0.8118 | ) |  |  | (2.4474 | ) | (1.8726 | ) |\n| Declared dividends on Shares (C$) | \u2014 |  | 4,096 |  |  |  | 4,096 |  | 39,668 |  |\n| Declared dividends per Share (C$)6 | \u2014 |  | 0.0531 |  |  |  | \u2014 |  | 0.5312 |  |\n\n 1. Free Cash Flow is not a recognized measure under IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS.\n2. U.S. exchange rate (C$ per US$) is the weighted average exchange rate applicable to dividends declared for the period.\n3. Changes in non-cash working capital are excluded from the calculation of Free Cash Flow as these temporary fluctuations are managed through the credit facilities which are available to fund general corporate requirements, including working capital requirements, subject to borrowing capacity restrictions. Changes in non-cash working capital are presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows net of interest and income taxes paid.\n4. The cash effect of the difference between the defined benefit expense and funding is included in the determination of cash from operating activities. This cash effect is excluded in the determination of Free Cash Flow as management believes that the defined benefit expense amount provides a more appropriate measure, as the defined benefit funding can be impacted by special payments to reduce the unfunded pension liability.\n5. Foreign exchange gain (loss) on cash held in foreign currency is excluded in the determination of cash from operating activities under IFRS; however, because it is a cash item, management believes it should be included in the calculation of Free Cash Flow.\n6. Per Share calculations for Free Cash Flow (C$) are determined by dividing Free Cash Flow by the total number of all issued and outstanding Shares using the weighted average over the period. The weighted average number of Shares outstanding for 2023 Q2 was 77,174,517 and 77,140,467 for 2022 Q2. The weighted average number of Shares outstanding for 2023 Q2 LTM and 2022 Q2 LTM are 77,159,634 and 74,517,345, respectively. Per Share calculations for declared dividends (C$) are determined by dividing the amount of declared dividends by the number of outstanding Shares at the respective period end date.\n7. Normalized to exclude non-operating expenses and recoveries related to the costs of assessing strategic and corporate initiatives.\n8. Normalized to exclude non-operating restructuring costs. Costs primarily relate to severance costs, inefficient labour costs, increased medical costs and right-of-use asset impairments and inventory impairments associated with NFI Forward and other restructuring initiatives. Free Cash Flow reconciling amounts are net of right-of-use asset and property, plant and equipment impairments.\n9. The fair value adjustment of the total return swap is a non-cash (gain) loss that is excluded from the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Beginning in Q2 2022, hedge accounting was applied to the total return swap derivative and therefore, the portion of the (gain) loss on the fair value adjustment, which does not apply to the current period is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n10. A portion of the fair value adjustment of the total return swap is added to Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to match the equivalent portion of the related deferred compensation expense recognized. Beginning in Q2 2022, hedge accounting was applied to the total return swap derivative and therefore, the portion of the (gain) loss on the fair value adjustment, which does not apply to the current period is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n11. Costs and recoveries associated with amendments to, and closures of, the Company's pension plans. Q2 2022 includes $7.0 million for the liability related to the closure of the Pembina facility and withdrawal from the multi-employer pension plan. Also included is $4.8 million of pension past service costs.\n12. Normalized to exclude non-operating costs related to an insurance event that are not recoverable, or are related to the deductible.\n13. Provision for sales taxes as a result of a previous state sales tax review.\n14. Normalized to exclude COVID-19 related costs. Costs primarily relate to asset impairments, medical costs directly related to COVID-19 and miscellaneous operating costs associated with COVID-19. Asset impairments are primarily attributable to pre-owned coach inventory. During 2022, management determined costs related to sanitization and masks were an operating cost and would no longer be included in the definition.\n15. Includes fair market value adjustments to interest rate swaps and the cash conversion option on the Convertible Debentures. 2023 Q2 includes a loss of $2.0 million and 2022 Q2 includes a gain of $5.8 million for the interest rate swaps. 2023 Q2 includes a loss of $4.5 million and 2022 Q2 includes a gain of $5.9 million on the cash conversion option.\n16. Includes adjustments made related to expenses that pertain to prior years. 2022 Q2 includes expenses related to amounts that should have been capitalized from Fiscal years 2010 - 2021.\n17. Includes adjustments made related to items that occurred outside of normal operations. This includes specified items purchased in broker markets at a premium and associated broker fees, which the Company provided to suppliers, and does not normally directly purchase. Also included is the additional labour costs associated with the shortage of the specified item.\n18. Includes 2022 Q4 impairment charges with respect to ARBOC's goodwill of $23.2 million and the ADL manufacturing cash generating unit (\"CGU\")'s goodwill of $80.7 million.\n\n Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Loss\n\n Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Loss per Share are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS.

The average invested capital for the last twelve months is used in the calculation of ROIC. ROIC is not a recognized measure under IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. Accordingly, ROIC may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. See Non-IFRS Measures for the definition of ROIC.\n\n \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (U.S. dollars in thousands) - unaudited |  | **2023 Q2** |  | **2023 Q1** |  | **2022 Q4** |  | **2022 Q3** |  |\n| Shareholders' Equity | $ | 495,140 |  | 533,756 |  | 577,575 |  | 710,984 |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Addback |  |  |  |  |\n| Long term debt |  | 935,605 |  | 911,203 |  | 896,626 |  | 859,297 |  |\n| Obligation under lease |  | 124,405 |  | 127,247 |  | 131,625 |  | 122,666 |  |\n| Convertible Debentures |  | 225,081 |  | 218,719 |  | 217,516 |  | 211,281 |  |\n| Senior unsecured debt |  | 87,363 |  | 86,431 |  | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |\n| Derivatives |  | 9,422 |  | (17,164 | ) | (21,620 | ) | (18,904 | ) |\n| Cash |  | (57,488 | ) | (59,375 | ) | (49,987 | ) | (39,832 | ) |\n| Bank indebtedness |  | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |\n| **Invested Capital** |  | 1,819,528 |  | 1,800,817 |  | 1,751,735 |  | 1,845,492 |  |\n| Average of invested capital over the quarter |  | 1,810,173 |  | 1,776,276 |  | 1,798,614 |  | 1,822,554 |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | **2022 Q2** | **2022 Q1** | **2021 Q4** | **2021 Q3** |\n| Shareholders' Equity |  | 783,905 |  | 850,323 |  | 871,772 |  | 787,010 |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Addback |  |  |  |  |\n| Long term debt |  | 718,139 |  | 677,996 |  | 586,411 |  | 1,049,273 |  |\n| Capital leases |  | 131,077 |  | 139,129 |  | 143,675 |  | 150,212 |  |\n| Convertible Debentures |  | 224,947 |  | 229,673 |  | 225,768 |  | \u2014 |  |\n| Senior unsecured debt |  | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |\n| Derivatives |  | (8,179 | ) | 4,806 |  | 31,883 |  | 20,920 |  |\n| Cash |  | (50,274 | ) | (26,604 | ) | (77,318 | ) | (64,822 | ) |\n| Bank indebtedness |  | \u2014 |  | 1,233 |  | \u2014 |  | \u2014 |  |\n| **Invested Capital** |  | 1,799,615 |  | 1,876,556 |  | 1,782,191 |  | 1,942,593 |  |\n| Average of invested capital over the quarter |  | 1,838,086 |  | 1,829,373 |  | 1,862,392 |  | 1,924,303 |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\n **Appendix B - Non-IFRS Measures and Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n **Non-IFRS Measures**\n\n References to \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d are to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization after adjusting for the effects of certain non-recurring and/or non-operations related items and expenses incurred outside the normal course of operations that do not reflect the current ongoing cash operations of the Company. These adjustments include gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, fair value adjustment for total return swap, unrealized foreign exchange losses or gains on non-current monetary items and forward foreign exchange contracts, costs associated with assessing strategic and corporate initiatives, past service costs and other pension costs or recovery, non-operating costs or recoveries related to business acquisition, fair value adjustment to acquired subsidiary company's inventory and deferred revenue, proportion of the total return swap realized, equity settled stock-based compensation, expenses incurred outside the normal course of operations, recovery of currency transactions, prior year sales tax provision, COVID-19 costs and impairment loss on goodwill and non-operating restructuring costs.\n\n References to \"NOPAT\" are to Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation of plant and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets and income taxes at a rate of 31%.\n\n \u201cFree Cash Flow\u201d means net cash generated by or used in operating activities adjusted for changes in non-cash working capital items, interest paid, interest expense, income taxes paid, current income tax expense, repayment of obligation under lease, cash capital expenditures, acquisition of intangible assets, proceeds from disposition of property, plant and equipment, costs associated with assessing strategic and corporate initiatives, fair value adjustment to acquired subsidiary company's inventory and deferred revenue, defined benefit funding, defined benefit expense, past service costs and other pension costs or recovery, expenses incurred outside the normal course of operations, proportion of total return swap, unrecoverable insurance costs, prior year sales tax provision, non-operating restructuring costs, extraordinary COVID-19 costs, foreign exchange gain or loss on cash held in foreign currency.\n\n References to \"ROIC\" are to NOPAT divided by average invested capital for the last twelve month period (calculated as to shareholders\u2019 equity plus long-term debt, obligations under leases, other long-term liabilities and derivative financial instrument liabilities less cash).\n\n References to \"Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss)\" are to net earnings (loss) after adjusting for the after tax effects of certain non-recurring and/or non-operational related items that do not reflect the current ongoing cash operations of the Company including: fair value adjustments of total return swap, unrealized foreign exchange loss or gain, unrealized gain or loss on the interest rate swap, impairment loss on goodwill, portion of the total return swap realized, costs associated with assessing strategic and corporate initiatives, fair value adjustment to acquired subsidiary company's inventory and deferred revenue, equity settled stock-based compensation, gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, past service costs and other pension costs or recovery, recovery on currency transactions, expenses incurred outside the normal course of operations prior year sales tax provision, COVID-19 costs and non-operating restructuring costs .\n\n References to \"Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share\" are to Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) divided by the average number of Shares outstanding.\n\n Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, ROIC, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) per Share are useful measures in evaluating the performance of the Company. However, Adjusted EBITDA, ROIC, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share are not recognized earnings or cash flow measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. Readers of this press release are cautioned that ROIC, Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings or loss or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of NFI\u2019s performance, and Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of liquidity and cash flows. A reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, based on the Financial Statements, has been provided under the headings \u201cReconciliation of Net Earnings (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA\u201d. A reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) is provided under the heading \u201cReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Loss\u201d.\n\n NFI's method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA, ROIC, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings per Share may differ materially from the methods used by other issuers and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other issuers. Dividends paid from Free Cash Flow are not assured, and the actual amount of dividends received by holders of Shares will depend on, among other things, the Company's financial performance, debt covenants and obligations, working capital requirements and future capital requirements, all of which are susceptible to a number of risks, as described in NFI\u2019s public filings available on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\n \"Liquidity\" is not a recognized measure under IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. The Company defines liquidity as cash on-hand plus available capacity under its credit facilities.\n\n \"Backlog\" value is not a recognized measure under IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS.\n\n References to NFI's geographic regions for the purpose of reporting global revenues are as follows: \"North America\" refers to Canada, United States, and Mexico; United Kingdom and Europe refer to the United Kingdom and Europe; \"Asia Pacific\" or \"APAC\" refers to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand; and the \"Other\" category includes any sales that do not fall into the categories above.\n\n **Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n This press release contains \u201cforward-looking information\u201d and \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws, which reflect the expectations of management regarding the Company's Refinancing Plan, the Private Placement, the use of proceeds therefrom, the second lien debt financing, the Company\u2019s future growth, financial performance, and liquidity and objectives and the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives, plans, business prospects and opportunities, including the duration, impact of and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and plans to address them, and the Company's expectation of obtaining long-term credit arrangements and sufficient liquidity. The words \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cviews\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201cprojects\u201d, \u201cforecasts\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d, \u201cguidance\u201d, \u201cgoals\u201d, \u201cobjectives\u201d and \u201ctargets\u201d and similar expressions of future events or conditional verbs such as \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current expectations regarding future events (including the temporary nature of the supply chain disruptions and operational challenges, production improvement, labour supply shortages, the recovery of the Company\u2019s markets and the expected benefits to be obtained through its \u201cNFI Forward\u201d initiatives) and the Company\u2019s financial and operating performance and speak only as of the date of this press release. By their very nature, forward-looking statements require management to make assumptions and involve significant risks and uncertainties, should not be read as guarantees of future events, performance or results, and give rise to the possibility that management\u2019s predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that the assumptions may not be correct and that the Company\u2019s future growth, financial condition, ability to generate sufficient cash flow and maintain adequate liquidity, obtain long-term credit arrangements, and the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives, objectives, plans, business prospects and opportunities, including the Company\u2019s plans and expectations relating to the duration, impact of and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, operational challenges, labour supply shortages and inflationary pressures, will not occur or be achieved. There can be no assurance that the transactions comprising the Refinancing Plan will be completed on the terms disclosed or otherwise. There can be no assurance that further relief from the lenders under NFI's senior secured facilities or additional liquidity support will be available.\n\n A number of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements include: the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain and operational challenges, inflationary effects and labour supply challenges; the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine due to factors including but not limited to further supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and tariffs on certain raw materials and components that may be necessary for the Company\u2019s operations; funding may not continue to be available to the Company\u2019s customers at current levels or at all; the Company\u2019s business is affected by economic factors and adverse developments in economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on the demand for the Company\u2019s products and the results of its operations; currency fluctuations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results or competitive position; interest rates could change substantially, materially impacting the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability; an active, liquid trading market for the Shares and/or the Debentures may cease to exist, which may limit the ability of security holders to trade Shares and/or Debentures; the market price for the Shares and/or the Debentures may be volatile; if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about the Company and its business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the Shares or if the Company\u2019s results of operations do not meet their expectations, the Share price and trading volume could decline, in addition, if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about the Company or its business, the Share price and trading volume of the Shares could decline; competition in the industry and entrance of new competitors; current requirements under U.S. \u201cBuy America\u201d regulations may change and/or become more onerous or suppliers\u2019 \u201cBuy America\u201d content may change; failure of the Company to comply with the U.S. Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (\u201cDBE\u201d) program requirements or the failure to have its DBE goals approved by the U.S. FTA; absence of fixed term customer contracts, exercise of options and customer suspension or termination for convenience; local content bidding preferences in the United States may create a competitive disadvantage; requirements under Canadian content policies may change and/or become more onerous; the Company\u2019s business may be materially impacted by climate change matters, including risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy; operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and/or systems or from external events, including fiduciary breaches, regulatory compliance failures, legal disputes, business disruption, pandemics, floods, technology failures, processing errors, business integration, damage to physical assets, employee safety and insurance coverage; international operations subject the Company to additional risks and costs and may cause profitability to decline; compliance with international trade regulations, tariffs and duties; dependence on unique or limited sources of supply (such as engines, components containing microprocessors or, in other cases, for example, the supply of transmissions, batteries for battery-electric buses, axles or structural steel tubing) resulting in the Company\u2019s raw materials and components not being readily available from alternative sources of supply, being available only in limited supply, a particular component may be specified by a customer, the Company\u2019s products have been engineered or designed with a component unique to one supplier or a supplier may have limited or no supply of such raw materials or components or sells such raw materials or components to the Company on less than favorable commercial terms; the Company\u2019s vehicles and certain other products contain electrical components, electronics, microprocessors control modules, and other computer chips, for which there has been a surge in demand, resulting in a worldwide supply shortage of such chips in the transportation industry, and a shortage or disruption of the supply of such microchips could materially disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and its ability to deliver products to customers; dependence on supply of engines that comply with emission regulations; a disruption, termination or alteration of the supply of vehicle chassis or other critical components from third-party suppliers could materially adversely affect the sales of certain of the Company\u2019s products; the Company\u2019s profitability can be adversely affected by increases in raw material and component costs; the Company may incur material losses and costs as a result of product warranty costs, recalls, failure to comply with motor vehicle manufacturing regulations and standards and the remediation of transit buses and motor coaches; production delays may result in liquidated damages under the Company\u2019s contracts with its customers; catastrophic events, including those related to impacts of climate change, may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns;

the Company may be adversely affected by rising insurance costs; the Company may not be able to maintain performance bonds or letters of credit required by its contracts or obtain performance bonds and letters of credit required for new contracts; the Company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business and may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and other claims; the Company may have difficulty selling pre-owned coaches and realizing expected resale values; the Company may incur costs in connection with regulations relating to axle weight restrictions and vehicle lengths; the Company may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws; dependence on management information systems and cyber security risks; the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategy and conduct operations is dependent upon its ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, including its ability to retain and attract executives, senior management and key employees; the Company may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-corruption laws and any determination that it violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on its business; the Company\u2019s risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in achieving their intended purposes; internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations; there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures; ability to successfully execute strategic plans and maintain profitability; development of competitive or disruptive products, services or technology; development and testing of new products or model variants; acquisition risk; reliance on third-party manufacturers; third-party distribution/dealer agreements; availability to the Company of future financing; the Company may not be able to generate the necessary amount of cash to service its existing debt, which may require the Company to refinance its debt; the Company\u2019s substantial consolidated indebtedness could negatively impact the business; the restrictive covenants in the Company\u2019s credit facilities could impact the Company\u2019s business and affect its ability to pursue its business strategies; in December 2022, the Board made the decision to suspend the payment of dividends given credit agreement constraints and to support the Company\u2019s focus on improving its liquidity and financial position and the resumption of dividend dividends is not assured or guaranteed; a significant amount of the Company\u2019s cash may be distributed, which may restrict potential growth; the Company is dependent on its subsidiaries for all cash available for distributions; the Company may not be able to make principal payments on the Debentures; redemption by the Company of the Debentures for Shares will result in dilution to holders of Shares; Debentures may be redeemed by the Company prior to maturity; the Company may not be able to repurchase the Debentures upon a change of control as required by the trust indenture under which the Debentures were issued (the \u201cIndenture\u201d); conversion of the Debentures following certain transactions could lessen or eliminate the value of the conversion privilege associated with the Debentures; future sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial number of Shares or Debentures may impact the price of the Shares and/or the Debentures and could result in dilution; payments to holders of the Debentures are subordinated in right of payment to existing and future Senior Indebtedness (as described under the Indenture) and will depend on the financial health of the Company and its creditworthiness; if the Company is required to write down goodwill or other intangible assets, its financial condition and operating results would be negatively affected; and income and other tax risk resulting from the complexity of the Company\u2019s businesses and operations and the income and other tax interpretations, legislation and regulations pertaining to the Company\u2019s activities being subject to continual change.\n\n Factors relating to the global COVID-19 pandemic include: the magnitude and duration of the global, national and regional economic and social disruption being caused as a result of the pandemic; the impact of national, regional and local governmental laws, regulations and \u201cshelter in place\u201d or similar orders relating to the pandemic which may materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to continue operations; partial or complete closures of one, more or all of the Company\u2019s facilities and work locations or the reduction of production rates (including due to government mandates and to protect the health and safety of the Company\u2019s employees or as a result of employees being unable to come to work due to COVID-19 infections with respect to them or their family members or having to isolate or quarantine as a result of coming into contact with infected individuals); production rates may be further decreased as a result of the pandemic; ongoing and future supply delays and shortages of parts and components, and shipping and freight delays, and disruption to or shortage of labour supply as a result of the pandemic; the pandemic will likely adversely affect operations of suppliers and customers, and reduce and delay, for an unknown period, customers\u2019 purchases of the Company\u2019s products and the supply of parts and components by suppliers; the anticipated recovery of the Company\u2019s markets in the future may be delayed or increase in demand may be lower than expected as a result of the continuing effects of the pandemic; the Company\u2019s ability to obtain access to additional capital if required; and the Company\u2019s financial performance and condition, obligations, cash flow and liquidity and its ability to maintain compliance with the covenants under its credit facilities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain sufficient liquidity for an extended period, obtain long-term credit arrangements, or access to additional capital or access to government financial support or as to when production operations will return to previous production rates. There is also no assurance that governments will provide continued or adequate stimulus funding during or after the pandemic for public transit agencies to purchase transit vehicles or that public or private demand for the Company\u2019s vehicles will return to pre-pandemic levels in the anticipated period of time. The Company cautions that due to the dynamic, fluid and highly unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its impact on global and local economies, supply chains, businesses and individuals, it is impossible to predict the severity of the impact on the Company\u2019s business, operating performance, financial condition and ability to generate sufficient cash flow and maintain adequate liquidity and any material adverse effects could very well be rapid, unexpected and may continue for an extended and unknown period of time.\n\n Factors relating to the Company's \u201cNFI Forward\u201d initiatives include: the Company's ability to successfully execute the initiative and to generate the planned savings in the expected time frame or at all; management may have overestimated the amount of savings and production efficiencies that can be generated or may have underestimated the amount of costs to be expended; the implementation of the initiative may take longer than planned to achieve the expected savings; further restructuring and cost-cutting may be required in order to achieve the objectives of the initiative; the estimated amount of savings generated under the initiative may not be sufficient to achieve the planned benefits; combining business units and/or reducing the number of production or parts facilities may not achieve the efficiencies anticipated; and the impact of the continuing global COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operational benefits, cost savings or other benefits of the initiative.\n\n Factors relating to the Company\u2019s financial guidance and targets disclosed in this press release include, in addition to the factors set out above, the degree to which actual future events accord with, or vary from, the expectations of, and assumptions used by, the Company\u2019s management in preparing the financial guidance and targets and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully execute the \u201cNFI Forward\u201d initiatives and to generate the planned savings in the expected time frame or at all.\n\n Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended or to occur or be achieved at all. Specific reference is made to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Information Form for a discussion of the factors that may affect forward-looking statements and information. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements and information.

canopy](https://www.environmentalleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Planet-Forest-Tracking.jpg.webp)(Credit: Planet Labs)Planet Labs has announced plans to release its Forest Carbon Planetary Variable, a dataset that will provide insights into forest changes and carbon capture.\n\nThe modeling product will be able to analyze forest ecosystems nearly at the individual tree level. The tool will prove especially useful for voluntary carbon market participants, service providers dependent on forests in their supply chains, and regulators needing insights into changes in forest area and carbon stocks, to name a few. The dataset will also match the accuracy of physical and airborne measurements of forest cover and carbon at a much lower cost.\n\nA 30-meter resolution product will be released this year, and the company plans to also launch a [3-meter resolution product in 2024](https://learn.planet.com/forest-carbon-prerelease).\n\n\u201cOur Forest Carbon Planetary Variable represents a significant leap forward in carbon monitoring capabilities, and we\u2019re excited to offer it at such an accessible price to empower organizations to truly scale their understanding of forest change,\u201d said Planet Labs\u2019 President of Product and Business, Kevin Weil. \u201cWith its high resolution, accuracy, and frequency, Planet\u2019s Forest Carbon sets a new industry standard that will enable more informed decision-making and drive effective climate action worldwide.\u201d\n\n [![](https://static.environmentalleader.com/645015b1d9767a179775a770265270f8.png)](https://ads.environmentalleader.com/www/delivery/cl.php?bannerid=7361&zoneid=272&sig=dde46187b5006cb3c81b1f1e716209cea2d2624dbe4aef88c069d88e826edd4d&oadest=https%3A%2F%2Fevents.zoom.us%2Fev%2FAl5n1Ep1ox-fuR7yq3oWsGb_prHVdZ73pL5YezY34Kl6wv6av4XJ%7EAggLXsr32QYFjq8BlYLZ5I06Dg%3Futm_source%3DWebsite%26utm_medium%3DBanner%26utm_campaign%3DEESummit23)![](https://ads.environmentalleader.com/www/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=7361&campaignid=2820&zoneid=272&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.environmentalleader.com%2F2023%2F08%2Fplanet-labs-releases-forest-carbon-dataset%2F&cb=0384dc1110)\n[![](http://ads.environmentalleader.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=272&cb=&n=abab4b2c)](http://ads.environmentalleader.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=abab4b2c&cb=)Importance of Accurate Carbon Monitoring for Greenwashing Prevention\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlanet Labs\u2019 new tool will provide frequent and granular data that contributes to accurate carbon monitoring, helping [limit fraud and other greenwashing tactics](https://www.environmentalleader.com/2023/03/cse-net-zero-climate-commitments-ambitious-goals-or-greenwashing/). The company also aims to make transparency affordable by offering the product at as low as $0.10 per hectare.\n\nThe World Economic Forum claims the voluntary [carbon market lacks transparency](https://www.environmentalleader.com/2023/08/blockchain-technology-adds-transparency-and-integrity-to-carbon-markets/), so various technologies like these are being developed and adopted to better monitor them. With such carbon-tracking abilities, companies can show stakeholders exactly where carbon credits derive.\n\nWith the Forest Carbon tool, data can be collected on aboveground live carbon, canopy height, and canopy cover. It will also be updated quarterly to ensure up-to-date decision-making for its stakeholders.\n\n\nCategories [Air &

With [carbon offsetting demands growing](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/major-increase-in-carbon-offsetting-thanks-to-greta-thunberg-effect-2/) to accommodate net-zero targets, the independent body aims to issue labelled credits by the end of the year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe global carbon offset market is unregulated, which makes it hard for companies to gauge which credits are good, with questions over the industry\u2019s poor transparency and the environmental quality of projects. To combat this, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) has published its criteria for projects to achieve its new [Core Carbon Principles](https://icvcm.org/the-core-carbon-principles/) (CCPs).\n\n\nSpeaking to [FoodNavigator](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2023/08/11/Carbon-market-gives-clearer-rules-on-offsetting), an ICVCM spokesperson said: \u201cThe past year has seen a number of companies withdraw from earlier commitments to purchase carbon credits as concerns mounted over the quality of credits on the market.\u201d\n\n\nThey added that the issue wasn\u2019t a lack of good carbon credits, but rather a difficulty for buyers to distinguish between the good and the bad. The sector is filled with bilateral transactions, with minimal standardisation and no central exchange, meaning companies must carry out extensive due diligence in-house. Some have found that the credits they bought turned out to be of lower quality than they initially thought. \u201cThis has reduced confidence and purchases, which ultimately means less finance for projects to reduce and remove carbon emissions,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\u201cIt is expected that this [new guideline] will give buyers greater confidence and drive up both purchases and prices for high-quality credits, increasing finance for impactful projects and providing incentives for developers to improve standards,\u201d they added.\n\n\n\n\nThe result of a 60-day deliberation between stakeholders in the voluntary carbon market and scientific and industry experts, the 10 core principles are spread into three categories: emissions impact, governance and sustainable development. Additionality, permanence, robust quantification and prohibiting double counting make up the first part, while effective governance, tracking, transparency and third-party validation and verification compose the governance category. The last one, meanwhile, involves sustainable development benefits and safeguards, and contributions towards net-zero transition.\n\n\nCurrently, it isn\u2019t mandatory for a business retiring a carbon credit to disclose its name, but under the new standards, registries retiring CCP credits will need to identify on whose behalf the credits have been retired. And once a credit has been retired, it can\u2019t be traded or used to meet climate targets by another company.\n\n\n\u2018Carbon-neutral\u2019 claims and greenwashing concerns\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAccording to FoodNavigator, the carbon credit framework advises companies to follow a \u2018climate contribution\u2019 approach, where \u201ccarbon credits are not counted towards, nor represent compensation for, a company\u2019s remaining value chain emissions\u201d.\u200b It refers to using credits for climate mitigation, rather than making claims that a company has canceled, counterbalanced or netted out its emissions.\n\n\nA spokesperson from climate action organisation [Science Based Targets Initiative](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) said this could lead to pushback against carbon-neutral claims, historically the most widely used climate-related \u2018achievement\u2019 used by businesses. The term can have multiple connotations \u2013 some feel it can facilitate a company\u2019s climate mitigation action beyond its value chain, while others find it conceals the impact of firms that haven\u2019t decarbonised.\n\n\n\n![carbon offsetting](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAMAAQMAAACAdIdOAAAAA1BMVEUAAACnej3aAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAFiS0dEAIgFHUgAAAB2SURBVBgZ7cEBAQAAAIKg/q92SMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIB7AYMPAAECmJwtAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)![carbon offsetting](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stop-Using-Carbon-Offsets-To-Avoid-Emissions-Cuts-Says-Greenpeace.jpg)Courtesy: Pexels\nThis confusion has also led to a reduction in carbon credit investment out of fear of being accused of greenwashing. It echoes a [recent poll](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/greenwashing-marketing-professionals-sustainability-campaigns-training-wualificatin/) by the [Chartered Institute of Marketing](https://www.cim.co.uk/newsroom/release-consumer-focus-on-sustainability-outstrips-marketers-current-skill-set-with-half-still-fearful-of-greenwashing/)\u00a0that revealed that 45% of marketing professionals have come under pressure from clients to provide more \u2018green\u2019 marketing, but the demand for such campaigns is outpacing education in this sector.\n\n\nMany of the surveyed marketers don\u2019t feel comfortable working on such projects as they fear they\u2019ll be accused of greenwashing, and almost half (49%) said they had spoken to their employer or client about the reputational and legal risks accusations of greenwashing have brought in the last five years.\n\n\nCompanies have been using carbon offsets \u2013 which include measures like tree planting \u2013 to cut emissions and meet their net-zero plans for years, but this practice has been criticised by many experts, [including Greenpeace](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/greenpeace-carbon-offsets/). One argument is that there [aren\u2019t enough trees](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/there-arent-enough-trees-in-the-world-offset-societys-carbon-emissions-there-never-will-be/) in the world to offset everybody\u2019s emissions, and there likely never will be.\n\n\n\u201cWe do expect this will have a significant impact on the market,\u201d ICVCM COO William McDonnell \u00a0told\u00a0[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/global-standards-launched-boost-2-bln-voluntary-carbon-market-2023-07-26/), \u201cbut we can\u2019t prejudge the pre-designed assessment process we are about to start.\u201d\n\n\n  \n[![APAC 2022 Article Banner](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAB4AAAADdAQAAAAByblLMAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAABKSURBVHja7cExAQAAAMKg9U9tCy+gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4GzQDQABO+wqCgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)![APAC 2022 Article Banner](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/APAC-2022-Report-Article-Banner.png)](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/apac-alt-protein-report-2022/) ", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) has released guidance to help companies choose better carbon credits and introduce more transparency to the unregulated sector.

The price signal incentivizes emission reductions and promotes investment in innovative, low-carbon technologies, whilst trading brings flexibility that ensures emissions are cut where it costs least to do so.\n\n\n> This European directive does have a large impact on the sector and as with any sector we assume there will be a process to figure out the exact structure of this market and how compliance and participation will look like.\n> \n> \n\n\u2026 said Ellen De Vocht, EEX Policy Advisor, in a talk organized by EEX Group which discussed the impact of EU ETS on the shipping industry.\n\nAfter each year, an operator must surrender enough allowances to cover fully its emissions, otherwise heavy fines are imposed. If an installation reduces its emissions, it can keep the spare allowances to cover its future needs or else sell them to another operator that is short of allowances.\n\nRevenues from the sale of allowances in the EU ETS mostly feed into Member States\u2019 budgets. Allowances are also auctioned to supply the funds supporting innovation in low-carbon technologies and the energy transition.\n\n\n> The fewer emissions you blow out into the world, the higher competitive advantage you have because it\u2019s directly linked to these common credits that you have to buy, so you one emission equals a carbon credit, and you can then level out how much that is going to cost you.\n> \n> \n\n\u2026 commented Tjard J\u00fcrgens, Senior Vice President \u2013 Business Development at Zeaborn during the same talk as Ellen De Vocht.\n\nThe EU ETS will concern all ships operating within the EU, regardless of flag state.\n\nTjard J\u00fcrgens also proposed three measures that industry parties can implement in order to comply with the EU ETS. These are as follows:\n\n1. Getting data reporting right is crucial as wrong calculations can result in major loss.\n2. Examine whether the company is ready to enter into the scheme as the process takes time\n3. Find trading partners such as brokers and discuss the decision\n\n**International Maritime Organization\u2019s take** \n\nThe highest level of ambition of the [2023 IMO GHG Strategy, adopted during MEPC 80](https://safety4sea.com/mepc-80-agrees-on-revised-ghg-strategy/), is to limit GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and to reach net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050, taking into account different national circumstances.\n\nIndicative checkpoints to reach net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping:\n\n* To reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20%, striving for 30%, by 2030, compared to 2008; and\n* To reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 70%, striving for 80%, by 2040, compared to 2008\n\nIMO uses two metrics to calculate GHG emissions:\n\n1. [The Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)](https://safety4sea.com/watch-imos-carbon-intensity-indicator-explained/#:~:text=The%20CII%20rating%20reflects%20the,intensity%20rating%20to%20be%20determined.): A continuous indicator of how environmentally friendly a ship\u2019s operations are. CII varies depending on factors such as speed, length of journeys, and kind and volume of cargo.\n2. [The Energy Efficiency eXisting ship Index (EEXI)](https://safety4sea.com/watch-imos-energy-efficiency-existing-ship-index-eexi-explained/): A one-time certification analyzing the technical aspects of the ship.\n\nRequirements for EEXI and CII certification came into effect on 1 January 2023. This means that the first annual reporting will be completed in 2023, with initial ratings given in 2024. IMO\u2019s Data Collection System (DCS) data is used to calculate ship\u2019s operational carbon intensity (CII).\n\n**Carbon pricing**\n\nOne major distinction in the EU\u2019s and IMO\u2019s approaches to decarbonization is the issue of price. During the most recent Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 80), industry stakeholders were eager to learn if the IMO would\u00a0proceed with the implementation of a carbon fee.\n\nMany groups and governments express the idea that a [carbon levy\u00a0is the only solution for the shipping industry to meet the IMO\u2019s GHG reduction targets](https://safety4sea.com/ics-ambitious-net-zero-target-can-only-be-achieved-with-a-levy/). For example, the [EU\u2019s proposal to the IMO contained a levy](https://safety4sea.com/eu-proposes-levy-on-shipping-emissions-in-view-of-mepc-80/), the amount of which would be proportional to the quantity of GHG released by the ship in question.\n\n\n> There is a broad support for a global market-based measure by the IMO that should be decided in an international context. In an ideal world, one carbon price is applied to a global sector and everyone in this global sector.\n> \n> \n\n\u2026 noted Ellen De Vocht\n\nFor more information, watch the video below:\n\n\u00a0\n\n[![](https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/login_button6_2-2022_07.png)](http://plus.safety4sea.com/login/)[![](https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subscribe_button-2019_08.png)](http://www.safety4sea.com/mailing-lists/)Tags: [decarbonization](https://safety4sea.com/tag/decarbonization/)[EU ETS](https://safety4sea.com/tag/eu-ets/)[IMO](https://safety4sea.com/tag/imo/)[regulatory update](https://safety4sea.com/tag/regulatory-update/)[videos](https://safety4sea.com/tag/videos/)", "summaries": [{"summary": "Prominent organizations are taking steps to limit emissions in the shipping industry to build a more sustainable future.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article highlights efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the impact of the shipping industry on climate change, indicating a positive intention and action."}, {"summary": "The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) aims to reduce carbon emissions in the maritime sector by setting a cap on greenhouse gases and allowing trading of emissions allowances.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The information provided describes the mechanism of the EU ETS without expressing a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "The EU ETS has a major impact on the shipping sector and operators must comply with emission limits or face fines.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The statement simply presents the consequences of not complying with the emission limits set by the EU ETS without showing a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "The International Maritime Organization aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050 and sets interim targets for emission reduction.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The goal of achieving net-zero emissions and setting interim reduction targets indicates a positive commitment and intention to combat climate change."}, {"summary": "The EU and IMO differ in their approaches to decarbonization, with the EU considering a carbon fee while the IMO explores a global market-based measure.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article presents the different approaches without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment."}], "semantic_commentary": "Potential customers in the shipping industry may be interested in buying carbon credits.", "sentiment_score": 0.4, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions systems, policies, and regulations (EU Emissions Trading System and International Maritime Organization) aimed at reducing carbon emissions in the shipping industry."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions organizations committing to reducing carbon emissions (EU and IMO) and setting targets for emission reduction."}]}, {"source": "Mondaq", "link": "https://www.mondaq.com/canada/environmental-law/1355816/alberta-environment-lays-charges-against-a-carbon-offset-firm-under-the-emissions-management-and-climate-resilience-act", "title": "Alberta Environment Lays Charges Against A Carbon Offset Firm Under The Emissions Management And Climate Resilience Act - Environmental Law - Canada", "content": "\nFor the first time, [Alberta Environment and Protected Areas](https://www.alberta.ca/environment-and-protected-areas.aspx)\n(**AEPA**) [charge](https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=8854718285539-B441-AE1E-F611B585ABDA84AE)d an Alberta based environmental\nservices company that provided third party verification services in\nconnection with the compliance and reporting obligations required\nunder the [*Emissions Management and Climate Resilience\nAct*](https://canlii.ca/t/56128) (***Emission Management Act***)\nand the [*Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction\nRegulation*](https://canlii.ca/t/561rl) (**TIER**). Specifically, this\nentity, among other things, allegedly contravened the *Emission\nManagement Act* by providing false information and lacked the\nnecessary qualifications to provide their verification service.\n\n\n### Compliance Obligations\n\n\nTIER, which is enacted under the *Emission Management\nAct*, implements Alberta's industrial carbon pricing and\nemissions trading system and regulates: (i) facilities that emit\n100,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide per year; (ii) facilities\nthat emit 2,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide per year and have\nvoluntarily opted-in to TIER; or (iii) owners or operators of two\nor more conventional oil and gas facilities, who have applied to\nhave their facility regulated by TIER (each a **Regulated\nFacility**).\n\n\nTIER prescribes a \"person responsible\" for each\nRegulated Facility, and requires such person to submit annual\ncompliance reports, detailing how the Regulated Facility has met\nits greenhouse gas (**GHG**) emission reduction\nrequirements required by TIER.\n\n\nSuch GHG emission reduction requirements can be achieved in a\nnumber of ways including: (i) physically abating GHG emissions from\nsuch Regulated Facility; (ii) submitting emission offsets\n(**Emission Offsets**); (iii) submitting emission\nperformance credits (**EPCs**); (iv) converting\nEmission Offsets into sequestration credits (**Sequestration\nCredits**) and then submitting them; (v) purchasing fund\ncredits (**Fund Credits**) by paying into a TIER fund\nat an annual per tonne price prescribed by TIER (which, as of 2023\nis $65/tonne); or (vi) subject to certain restrictions, any\npermutation of (i) through (v) above.\n\n\nTIER is not only relevant to Regulated Facilities and the\npersons responsible for them. Project proponents of Emission Offset\nproducing facilities must comply with certain TIER requirements as\nwell. Such facilities, if operated in accordance with TIER\nprescribed GHG quantification protocols, can generate Emission\nOffsets which can be sold to a person responsible for a Regulated\nFacility so that such Emission Offset can be used to achieve the\nannual compliance obligations in respect of such Regulated\nFacility.\n\n\nA key feature of TIER is the requirement for persons responsible\nfor Regulated Facilities and Emission Offset project proponents, to\nhave their TIER prescribed filings scrutinized by an entity\naccredited as a verification body to the ISO Standard 14065:2013 (a\n**Third Party Assurance Provider**). Accordingly,\nThird Party Assurance Providers play a critical role in maintaining\nthe integrity of TIER's industrial carbon pricing and emission\ntrading system.\n\n\n### The Charges\n\n\nAmberg Corp. (**Amberg**) and Olga Kiiker\n(**Kiiker**) face the following 25 charges for actions\nalleged to have occurred between April 1, 2021 and June 29,\n2021:\n\n\n* 1 charge under section 44(a) of [the *Emission\nManagement Act*](https://canlii.ca/t/56128) for knowingly providing false or misleading\ninformation pursuant to a requirement under *Emission Management\nAct* or the regulations to provide information;\n* 1 charge under section 44(b) of *Emission Management\nAct* for providing false or misleading information pursuant to\na requirement under *Emission Management Act* or the\nregulations to provide information;\n* 11 charges under section 33(b) of TIER for failing to comply\nwith the rules and other requirements set out in Part 1 of the\nStandard for Validation, Verification and Audit, in providing a\nverification referred to in section 15(4)(e) of TIER contrary to\nsection 15(6); and\n* 12 charges under section 33(f) of TIER for performing the\nfunctions of a third party assurance provider and not having the\nqualifications, or is not eligible to be a third party assurance\nprovider under section 27.\n\n\nEach of the charges carry the potential for penalties, ranging\nbetween $50,000 - $100,000 for an individual and $500,000 -\n$1,000,000 for a corporation. Should Amberg and Kiiker be found\nguilty in respect of all 25 charges, Amberg could be liable for up\nto $13,000,000 in penalties and Kiiker, individually, could be\nliable for up to $1,450,000. Although unlikely, the charges against\nKiiker, as an individual, also bring the risk of up to two years in\nprison.\n\n\n### The Role of Environmental Reporting in the Carbon Credit\nSystem\n\n\nThe legitimacy and validity of TIER required filings and any\nEPCs, Emission Offsets or Sequestration Credits referenced therein,\nis critical to Alberta's carbon market.\n\n\nIn the case where an EPC, Emission Offset or Sequestration\nCredit referenced in an annual compliance report is subsequently\nfound to be invalid, the person responsible for the Regulated\nFacility to which such compliance report pertains must, within 60\ndays of receiving notice of the cancellation or direction from\nAEPA, do one of the following:\n\n\n* pay into the TIER Fund an amount equal to the amount it would\nhave had to contribute to obtain one fund credit for the year the\ninvalidated Emission Offset, EPC or Sequestration Credit was used;\nor\n* use another unused Emission Offset, EPC, or Sequestration\nCredit, in place of the invalidated Emission Offset, EPC or\nSequestration Credit.\n\n\nIt is important to note that such curative requirements are\noperative notwithstanding that such invalidated Emission Offset,\nEPC or Sequestration Credit may have been verified by a Third Party\nAssurance Provider, as required under TIER. Such verification,\nwhile indicative of the validity of such credits, is not\nconclusively determinative of their validity.\n\n\nAccordingly, it is critical for those transacting in any\nEmission Offsets, EPCs or Sequestration Credits to not view\nsuccessful verification as a substitute for the proper allocation\nof invalidation risk as between buyer and seller in the operative\ntransaction documents.\n\n\nTo view the original article click [here](/redirection.asp?article_id=1355816&company_id=18&redirectaddress=https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/canadian-era-perspectives/alberta-environment-lays-charges-against-carbon-offset-firm-under-emissions-management-and-climate-resilience-act)\n\n\n*The content of this article is intended to provide a general\nguide to the subject matter.

[Chris Bowen told an Australian Business Economists forum in Sydney that policies were needed to ensure a level playing field for Australian firms](https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/bowen-s-green-tariff-to-shield-steel-cement-against-carbon-leakage-20230814-p5dwew). Mentioning the European Union\u2019s (EU) CBAM by name, he said that his department would prepare a review to assess carbon leakage risks, develop policy options and look at the feasibility of an Australian CBAM, particularly in relation to steel and cement.\n\n\nThe Antipodean nation has past form when it comes to carbon legislation. Back in 2012 it introduced the Clean Energy Act under the Gillard administration. The legislation was intended to introduce an emissions trading scheme with a carbon pricing scheme. However, it faced opposition from rival political parties and the Cement Industry Federation warned that the local cement sector was vulnerable to overseas competitors outside of the scheme. Job losses followed and Adelaide Brighton appeared to react by focusing more on imports. The Abbott administration then abolished the act in 2014 putting forward its Clean Energy Future package instead, which focused more on investing towards change. Jump forward nearly a decade and the Albanese government passed its Climate Change Bill in 2022. This set legally binding targets, including a commitment to cut CO2 emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2030. Bowen\u2019s look at a CBAM is an obvious next step from here, addressing one of the main criticisms of the previous Clean Energy Act.\n\n\nLocal building materials company Boral reacted positively to a CBAM in its annual results released earlier this week with chief executive officer Vik Bansal saying that the company was \u201c...advocating for an effective Carbon Border Adjusted Mechanism for Australia.\u201d He also reconfirmed the group\u2019s commitment to a target of net zero emissions by 2050. However, at the same time, Boral also reduced its emissions reduction target to 2025 from 2019 figures to up to 14% from 19% previously. This was blamed on \u201cexternal factors\u201d such as delays in securing the required regulatory approvals for the next phases of an alternative fuel program. Mining company Rio Tinto also warned in late July 2023, as part of its half-year financial results, that it might potentially miss its emissions target for 2025 unless it resorted to buying carbon credits.\n\n\nCBAMs became serious in 2023 when the EU passed its own scheme into law in May 2023. The EU CBAM will now enter into a transitional phase from 1 October 2023 until the end of 2025. During this period importers of goods covered by the legislation will be required to report greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) embedded in their imports (direct and indirect emissions) but they will not have to make any financial payments or adjustments. The system will then enter its full format from 1 January 2026, with affected importers being forced to purchase and surrender CBAM certificates, which will be priced at the EU emission trading scheme (ETS) rate, currently at around Euro88/t. [Other CBAMs have also been mooted in Canada and the US](/3.\thttps://www.globalcement.com/news/item/14316-too-taxing-how-the-cbam-affects-cement-exporters-to-the-eu). [In Canada the government ran a consultation on border carbon adjustments in 2021](/2.\thttps://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/consultations/2021/border-carbon-adjustments.html). It is currently considering its next steps. The US meanwhile has had both Republican and Democrat party senators make separate suggestions for a CBAM since at least 2021.\n\n\nJust because the EU is set to implement its CBAM and other countries are considering their own versions doesn\u2019t mean that they are necessarily a good idea. Cembureau, the European cement association, has been steadily lobbying on the details such as indirect emissions and waste incineration in the EU CBAM for years. Criticisms of CBAMs in general include potential clashes with World Trade Organisation rules, accusations of protectionism, triggering inflation, not being equitable to less developed nations and even failing to stop carbon leakage in the first place. The EU CBAM has also linked itself to the local ETS price. So, even after the transitional period, the carbon price may start to jump about in unpredictable ways once the system fully goes live in 2026.\n\n\nThe game-changer in recent years for international carbon emissions reduction legislation though was arguably when the US government introduced its Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This is because it served both sustainability and self-interest on a grander scale than seen previously. The act promised US$369bn in subsidies for companies to invest in low carbon technology. However, the catch was that the investment tied supply chains to the US market, much to the ire of some of the US\u2019 trade partners such as the EU. CBAMs offer a similar opportunity to governments around the world if they choose. They can be used to protect domestic carbon emission reduction effects in heavy industry but they can also be used for protectionism. Hence Bowen was due to say during his speech that the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies elsewhere \u201cmean that Australia needs to act to stay in the game.\u201d Australia has the advantage that it can watch how the EU CBAM pans out before it implements its own version.\n\n ", "summaries": [{"summary": "Australia's Climate Change Minister plans to look at a potential carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to ensure a level playing field for Australian firms.

Professionals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/images/responsive/etenergyworld-default.jpg)With 176.49 GW [renewable energy](/tag/renewable+energy) (including large hydro) accounting for approximately 42.5 per cent of the total generation capacity, installed in India as of June 2023, the country remains steadfast on its trajectory of augmenting RE capacity to fulfill its ambitious pledge of sourcing 50 per cent of energy demand from renewables by 2030 [1]. India has also committed to curtailing its overall carbon emissions by one billion tonne by 2030, and to honour such a commitment, a plethora of policy decisions have been introduced during the past six months, including the [National Electricity Plan](/tag/national+electricity+plan) 2023 (NEP 2023) [2], the [National Green Hydrogen Mission](/tag/national+green+hydrogen+mission), 2023 (NGH Mission) [3], the [Carbon Credit Trading Scheme](/tag/carbon+credit+trading+scheme) (CCTS) [4] and the draft [Green Credit Programme Implementation Rules](/tag/green+credit+programme+implementation+rules) [5].  \n  \n\n\nAdvt\n\n\n\n\n\nThese initiatives are expected to propel integration of renewables and non-fossil feedstock into India\u2019s energy mix, as well as alleviate the economic burden associated with reduction of carbon emissions. While the NEP 2023 sets out the blueprint for amplifying India\u2019s generation capacity to address the growing energy demand [6], India\u2019s ability to unlock the path of decarbonisation hinges on capitalising on energy efficiency and carbon reduction technologies. For this purpose, CCTS has been rolled out as a cap-and-trade system and envisages formulation of a carbon trading market, wherein obligated entities emitting carbon within the limits set out, are entitled to receive carbon credits, which can then be sold to entities exceeding their quotas. Imposition of a price on emissions beyond the prescribed limit will empower the CCTS to channel private sector investments in clean energy technologies. If implemented in earnest, the energy efficiency measures can yield approximately 11-16 per cent energy saving benefits in the industrial sector [7].  \n  \nHarnessing the benefits of carbon market, however, is contingent upon its successful implementation, which necessitates rigorous target and price setting, development of credible verification mechanisms and penalties for failure to achieve targets. The total valuation of the global carbon market (along with carbon taxes) was estimated to be upward of $95 billion by the [World Bank](/tag/world+bank) in 2022, covering around 23 per cent of the global emissions [8]. To garner a sizeable share of this evolving market, the Bureau of Economic Efficiency (BEE) must draw from its experience under the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, and avoid the pitfalls which lead to oversupply of credits in the market. Clarity is also needed on permissibility and mechanics of voluntary purchasing (outside the compliance market), which is itself a $2 billion domain [9]. Although an earlier draft of the CCTS contemplated this aspect, it was omitted in the final version without any explanation. Additionally, expanding the ambit of carbon market to provide for cross-border transactions in carbon credits within the contours of CCTS, can be useful for monetising the cost of emission reduction and encouraging deployment of critical capital towards new \u2018green\u2019 technology, including low-carbon fuels.  \n  \n\n\nAdvt\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attempt to proliferate low-carbon fuels has been bolstered by the institutional support extended by flagship schemes of the government, such as NGH Mission and the strategic interventions for green hydrogen transition programmes [10]. While inclusion of green hydrogen and green ammonia in renewable purchase obligations of the obligated entities [11] will drive up the demand for such fuels, the government may also consider implementing measures to scale up production, improve logistics, establish a robust supply chain, and stimulate demand of other low-cost fuels (including sustainable aviation fuel) through minimum demand mandates. Despite high initial costs, if budgets provide for viability gap funding for the low-carbon fuels and the uptake of such fuels is guaranteed by introduction of demand mandates, technologically efficient measures for production of such fuels will emerge and give impetus to the green shift [12].  \n  \nAs India navigates this transition journey to meet its commitments, it is faced with the challenge of striking a balance between the demands of industrialisation and decarbonisation. It is now imperative for India to implement solutions, which draw wisdom from past endeavours and incorporate innovative approaches, to emerge as a global frontrunner in the green transition.  \n  \n**(This piece was written exclusively for ETEnergyworld by Ajay Sawhney, Partner, and Ragini Agarwal, Associate, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.)**  \n*References:  \n1 \u2018Installed Capacity\u2019 Dashboard, [Central Electricity Authority](/tag/central+electricity+authority) (last accessed on August 03, 2023).  \n2 National Electricity Plan \u2013 Volume I (Generation), Central Electricity Authority (May, 2023), available at   \nhttps://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/irp/2023/05/NEP\\_2022\\_32\\_FINAL\\_GAZETTE-1.pdf.  \n3 National Green Hydrogen Mission, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (January 2023), available at  \nhttps://mnre.gov.in/img/documents/uploads/file\\_f-1673581748609.pdf.  \n4 Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023, Ministry of Power (June 30, 2023), available at  \nhttps://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/CCTS.pdf.  \n5 (Draft) Green Credit Programme Implementation Rules, 2023, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (June 26, 2023), available at https://moef.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Draft-GCP-Notification-Inviting-Comments-27062023.pdf.  \n6 20th Electric Power Survey of India, Central Electricity Authority (November 2020), available at   \nhttps://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/ps\\_\\_\\_lf/2022/11/20th\\_EPS\\_\\_\\_\\_Report\\_\\_\\_Final\\_\\_\\_16.11.2022.pdf.  \n7 Unlocking National Energy Efficiency Potential (UNNATEE) (Strategy Plan Towards Developing an Energy Efficient Nation (2017-2031)), [Bureau of Energy Efficiency](/tag/bureau+of+energy+efficiency) (June, 2019), available at  \nhttps://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/UNNATEE\\_0.pdf.  \n8 State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2023, World Bank (May 2023), available at   \nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/05/23/record-high-revenues-from-global-carbon-pricing-near-100-billion.  \n9 State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2023, World Bank (May 2023), available at  \nhttps://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/58f2a409-9bb7-4ee6-899d-be47835c838f.  \n10 Scheme guidelines for implementation of \u201cStrategic Interventions for Gren Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Programme\u201d of the NGH Mission, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (June 28, 2023), available at:  \nhttps://mnre.gov.in/img/documents/uploads/file\\_f-1687964057675.pdf and  \nhttps://mnre.gov.in/img/documents/uploads/file\\_f-1687963916599.pdf.  \n11 Electricity (Promoting Renewable Energy Through Green Energy Open Access) Rules, 2022.  \n12 The Gren Shift (The low carbon transition of India\u2019s Oil & Gas sector), Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (April 2023), available at https://mopng.gov.in/files/uploads/ETAC\\_2023\\_FINAL\\_PRINT.pdf.*  \n \n* By \n Ajay Sawhney\n & \nRagini Agarwal\n,\n* [ETEnergyWorld](/agency/88675631/ETEnergyWorld)\n\n\n* Published On Aug 17, 2023 at 10:28 AM IST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* + Telegram\n\t+ Facebook\n\t+ Copy Link\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-no-comments.svg)\n\nBe the first one to comment.\nComment Now\n\n\nCOMMENTS\n--------\n\n\n\n\nComment Now\nRead Comment (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Comments\n------------\n\n\n\n\nPost\n\n\n\n\n\nPost\n\n\n\nFind this Comment Offensive?\n----------------------------\n\n\nChoose your reason below and click on the submit button.
