Ebb’s technology uses electrochemistry to split saltwater into its acidic and alkaline parts. The long-term plan is to return alkalinity to the ocean, creating chemical reactions that pull CO2 from the air and store it safely in the sea.\n\n\n“We’re essentially accelerating a natural process,” Ben Tarbell, CEO and co-founder of Ebb Carbon, told Canary Media. ​“So instead of taking millions of years [to happen], it takes weeks to months.”\n\n\n\nSubscribe to receive Canary's latest news\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, the two-year-old startup unveiled its first-of-a-kind demonstration project, which is designed to remove 100 metric tons of CO2 per year at full capacity. Along with PNNL, Ebb is partnering with research institutions such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Washington to better predict how its system could work at scale — and how it could potentially affect ocean ecosystems.\n\n\nOcean-based approaches are gaining traction within the burgeoning field of carbon dioxide removal, a process that’s considered ​“[unavoidable](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/carbon-removal-now-unavoidable-part-of-fighting-climate-change-un-says)” in fighting climate change. While countries must prioritize phasing out fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, those steps aren’t likely to be enough to avoid the worst effects of a warming planet, according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n\nSolutions for removing CO2 — including using [giant air filters](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/a-buzzy-new-carbon-removal-plant-is-catching-and-releasing-co2), [injecting ​“bio-oil” underground](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/inside-charm-industrials-multimillion-dollar-bid-to-remove-co2-with-plants) and [transforming mining waste](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/meet-a-startup-that-plans-to-use-mining-waste-to-capture-carbon-dioxide) — are all relatively nascent, and they all face significant scientific and technical barriers to scaling up. Even so, government agencies and private investors are plowing funding into these fledgling technologies in the hopes of making it easier and cheaper to draw down planet-warming carbon.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![Two tubes labeled \"raw seawater\" and a tube labeled \"filtered seawater\" run from a calm bay onto land.]()\nSeawater flows into PNNL's facility from the tranquil Sequim Bay. (Ebb Carbon)\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the Department of Energy [awarded](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/us-announces-first-winners-in-3-5b-carbon-removal-program) a total of $1.1 billion to two ​“direct air capture” hubs along the U.S. Gulf Coast, with two more hubs slated to be announced next year. The agency also [said it plans](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/notice-intent-issue-funding-opportunity-carbon-negative-shot-pilots) to offer funding to a variety of carbon-removal pilot projects, including five ocean-based systems. The program’s overarching goal is to enable ​“gigaton scales” of CO2 removal and storage by 2050, up from perhaps thousands of tons today.\n\n\nFor new outfits like Ebb, supersizing their projects isn’t the only challenge. Companies and researchers are still figuring out how to accurately quantify and verify just how much CO2 they’re locking away, and for how long. That information is key to knowing whether projects will ultimately benefit the climate — especially if businesses plan on selling carbon-removal ​“credits” or ​“offsets” to other entities.\n\n\n“The momentum is really just getting going around using the ocean as a climate solution,” said Christian Meinig, who leads the coastal sciences division at PNNL. ​“These are still early days, and we’re really going to learn a lot in these coming years.”\n\n\n**Harnessing the ocean to lock away CO2**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nOcean-based carbon removal strategies typically fall into [one of two categories](https://www.wri.org/insights/ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal).\n\n\n“Biotic” approaches rely on photosynthetic organisms to soak up carbon from the atmosphere and store it as biomass. For example, the Israeli companies [Rewind](https://www.rewind.earth/) and [BlueGreen Water Technologies](https://bluegreenwatertech.com/) are taking discarded plant matter and harmful algal blooms, respectively, and [sinking them](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/can-we-fight-climate-change-by-sinking-carbon-into-the-sea) to the bottom of the sea. [Ocean fertilization](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/complicated-role-iron-ocean-health-and-climate-change-180973893/), a theoretical and controversial idea, calls for sprinkling nutrients like iron over seawater to grow CO2-absorbing phytoplankton.\n\n\nThe second category, ​“abiotic” approaches, involves harnessing the seawater itself. [Artificial upwelling](https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/removing-carbon-dioxide-through-artificial-upwelling-and-downwelling-legal-challenges-and) refers to pumping nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean to the surface so it can absorb carbon, a process that would naturally happen over longer periods of time. Electrochemical techniques aim to use electricity to either enhance seawater’s ability to store carbon — or to directly extract CO2 from the ocean.\n\n\n[Equatic](https://www.equatic.tech/), a spinout of UCLA’s Institute for Carbon Management, is working on that last approach.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![A blue box with wires and tubes sits near the waterfront.]()\nEquatic's pilot reactor pumps in seawater at the Port of Los Angeles, California. (Equatic)\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the startup began operating pilot-scale plants in Los Angeles and Singapore, each of which can not only remove 100 kilograms of CO2 per day from seawater — they can also produce smaller amounts of hydrogen. The company plans to trap the extracted CO2 into calcium carbonate, which can be used in low-carbon building materials, and sell the hydrogen to industrial facilities, or use it to power their own process.  \n\n\n\nEquatic’s closed-system design enables it to track and monitor carbon ​“so that we know exactly what is happening before anything leaves the plant,” said Edward Sanders, the startup’s chief operating officer. ​“That’s quite a different approach” from other ocean-focused efforts, he added.\n\n\nEbb Carbon, meanwhile, is ramping up testing on its new demonstration project.\n\n\n","summaries":null,"semantic_commentary":null,"sentiment_score":null,"classifications":null},{"source":"ABC News","link":"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/hearings-begin-summits-proposed-co2-pipeline-project-stand-102415941","title":"ABC News – Breaking News, Latest News and Videos - ABC News","content":"BISMARCK, N.D. -- Public utility regulators in Iowa will begin a hearing Tuesday on a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline for transporting emissions of the climate-warming greenhouse gas for storage underground that has been met by resistant landowners who fear the taking of their land and dangers of a pipeline rupture.\n\nSummit Carbon Solutions' proposed $5.5 billion, 2,000-mile pipeline network would carry CO2 from 34 ethanol plants in five states to North Dakota for storage deep underground — a project involving carbon capture technology, which has attracted both interest and scrutiny in the U.S.\n\nNorth Dakota regulators earlier this month denied a siting permit for Summit's proposed route in the state, citing myriad issues they say Summit didn't appropriately address, such as cultural resource impacts, geologic instability and landowner concerns. On Friday, Summit petitioned regulators to reconsider. \n\nOther similar projects are proposed around the country, including ones by Navigator CO2 Ventures and Wolf Carbon Solutions, which would also have routes in Iowa.\n\nHere is what to know about Summit's project as more proceedings begin.\n\nWHAT IS CARBON CAPTURE?\n\nCarbon capture entails the gathering and removal of planet-warming CO2 emissions from industrial plants to be pumped deep underground for permanent storage.\n\nSupporters view the technology as a combatant of climate change. But opponents say carbon capture and storage isn't proven at scale and could require huge investments at the expense of cheaper alternatives such as solar and wind power, all at a time when there is an urgent need to phase out all fossil fuels.\n\nCarbon capture also is viewed by opponents as a way for fossil fuel companies to claim they are addressing climate change without actually having to significantly change their ways.\n\n“I think there's a recognition even in the fossil fuel industry that, whether you like it or not and agree or not, (climate change) is a reality you're going to deal with from a regulatory standpoint, and you'd better get out in front of it or you're going to get left behind,\" said Derrick Braaten, a Bismarck-based attorney involved in issues related to Summit’s project.\n\nNew federal tax incentives have made carbon capture a lucrative enterprise. The technology has the support of the Biden administration, with billions of dollars approved by Congress for various carbon capture efforts.\n\nHigh-profile supporters of Summit's project include North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum, a presidential candidate who has hailed the state's underground CO2 storage ability as a “geologic jackpot,\" and oil magnate Harold Hamm, whose company last year announced a $250 million commitment to Summit's project.\n\n“Carbon capture and storage is going to be more and more important every day as we go forward in America,” Hamm has said.\n\nWHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FIVE STATES?\n\nThe Iowa Utilities Board begins its public evidentiary hearing Tuesday in Fort Dodge, a hearing “anticipated to last several weeks,” according to a news release. The board's final decision on Summit's permit request will come sometime after the hearing.\n\nMinnesota's Public Utilities Commission has a hearing set for Aug. 31 in which the panel “will make decisions about the scope of environmental review” regarding Summit's permit application for its pipeline in two counties, said Charley Bruce, an energy facilities planner with the commission.\n\nA Summit attorney recently indicated to Minnesota that North Dakota regulators' decision to deny a permit will not affect the company's plans, including for other proposed routes in southern Minnesota.\n\nThe South Dakota Public Utilities Commission is set to begin its evidentiary hearing for the project on Sept. 11 and expects to make a final decision by Nov. 15. \n\nNebraska has no state-level regulatory authority for CO2 pipelines. Summit is working with counties individually in Nebraska.\n\nCounties don't approve or deny a route, but can institute ordinances' setbacks for land-use purposes that can dictate where a pipeline may go, and can enter into road haul agreements and road crossing permits, said Omaha-based attorney Brian Jorde. He represents more than 1,000 landowners opposed to CO2 pipeline projects in four states.\n\nSummit hasn't hit “an insurmountable legal obstacle” in North Dakota regulators' denial “because they literally said ‘try again,’” Braaten said.\n\n\"If they get over themselves I think that they could do it and get approved, but I think they certainly shot themselves in the foot and they're making it much harder in those other states because they're going to come in with those commissioners there looking at them with a certain level of skepticism because you literally just got denied a permit in North Dakota,\" he said.\n\nWHY ARE LANDOWNERS OPPOSED?\n\nLandowners have raised concerns about the pipeline breaking, as well as eminent domain, or the taking of private land for the project, with compensation.\n\nEminent domain laws vary state by state, said Jorde, who represents hundreds of people Summit has sued in South Dakota to take their land for its pipeline.\n\n“When you have the power of eminent domain like a hammer over a landowner's head, you can intimidate them into doing things they wouldn't otherwise do, which is sign easements, which Summit then turns around and says, ‘Look at all these “voluntary” easements we have. Look at all the “support” we have,' which is completely false,\" Jorde said.\n\nSummit has submitted eminent domain requests to the Iowa board. A Summit spokesperson did not specifically address the company's intentions related to eminent domain when asked by the AP.\n\n“Our team remains incredibly encouraged that Iowa landowners have signed voluntary easement agreements accounting for nearly 75% of the proposed pipeline route,\" spokesperson Sabrina Ahmed Zenor said in an email. \"This overwhelming level of support is a clear reflection that they believe like we do that our project will ensure the long-term viability of the ethanol industry, strengthen the agricultural marketplace for farmers, and generate tens of millions of dollars in new revenue for local communities across the Midwest.\"\n\nWHAT ABOUT UNDERGROUND STORAGE?\n\nSummit submitted a draft application for underground storage to a three-member state panel which Burgum chairs and includes the attorney general. The timeline for a hearing and decision by the panel is unclear.\n\nLast year, Summit and Minnkota Power Cooperative agreed to “co-develop” CO2 storage facilities in central North Dakota. Their agreement gives Summit access to Minnkota's storage site and sets a framework for jointly developing more CO2 storage nearby.\n\nMinnkota is pursuing Project Tundra, a project to install carbon capture technology at a coal-fired power plant.\n\nBraaten views Summit's Minnkota partnership as a backup plan, to “piggyback on a sure thing,\" he said.\n\nA North Dakota landowners group is suing over the state's process for allowing CO2 and gas storage on private land, and land survey laws.\n\nBraaten said the lawsuit, which would affect the permitting of a Summit storage site in North Dakota, is not directed at Summit but is tied to longtime legal battles related to landowner rights.\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Iowa begins hearing on proposed CO2 pipeline for underground storage","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"No strong positive or negative sentiment expressed"},{"summary":"North Dakota regulators denied siting permit for Summit's proposed route","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Landowner concerns and other issues inappropriately addressed by Summit"},{"summary":"Similar projects proposed in Iowa by Navigator CO2 Ventures and Wolf Carbon Solutions","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"No strong positive or negative sentiment expressed"},{"summary":"Carbon capture and storage technology promoted as combatant of climate change","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"Seen as potential solution to address climate change and supported by federal tax incentives"},{"summary":"Public Utilities Commissions in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota to make decisions on Summit's permit request and route","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"No strong positive or negative sentiment expressed"},{"summary":"Summit faces opposition from landowners over concerns of pipeline rupture and eminent domain","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Landowners fear land taking and dangers associated with pipeline"},{"summary":"Summit has obtained voluntary easements accounting for nearly 75% of the proposed pipeline route","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"Considered a clear reflection of support for the project"},{"summary":"Summit submitted draft application for underground CO2 storage","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"No strong positive or negative sentiment expressed"},{"summary":"North Dakota landowners group sues over CO2 and gas storage process on private land","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Legal battles related to landowner rights could affect Summit's storage site"}],"semantic_commentary":"Article relates to Intent as it discusses CO2 pipeline for underground storage.","sentiment_score":-0.1111111111111111,"classifications":[{"category":"category_s1","reason":"The article mentions carbon capture and storage technology as a combatant of climate change."},{"category":"category_n1","reason":"The article mentions news about carbon, specifically the proposed CO2 pipeline for underground storage."}]},{"source":"The Advocate","link":"https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/business/an-explainer-on-direct-air-capture-and-carbon-capture-and-why-both-are-growing-in/article_959846ba-3b9b-11ee-a6ea-cb640e445385.html","title":"An explainer on direct air capture and carbon capture, and why both are growing in Louisiana | Business | theadvocate.com","content":"\nOver the last few years, Louisiana has trumpeted the tens of billions of dollars being poured into carbon capture, the burgeoning technology designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions at industrial facilities.\n\nDirect air capture — carbon capture’s cousin — hasn't quite received that level of monetary love here.

The specifics are a little more complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon dioxide capture systems typically fall into one of two categories, according to LSU chemical engineering professor John Flake: solid adsorbents, which are used for direct air capture, and liquid absorbents, which are more suited for carbon capture.\n\nFor direct air capture, large fans circulate ambient air into a filtration system where solid adsorbents “grab” the carbon dioxide, Flake said. The carbon dioxide is later “driven off” the adsorbents using either a vacuum or heat before it is either sequestered deep underground or siphoned for other industrial purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s basically a fan and a filter,” said John Thompson, markets and technology director for the Clean Air Task Force, a Boston-based environmental organization.\n\nThe current atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is about 420 parts per million, Flake said. Though that figure is higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution, that concentration is still small enough to require “huge volumes of air” for the adsorbents to work. That makes direct air capture more energy intensive than carbon capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattelle, the lead developer of Project Cypress, has said it plans to use renewable energy generated by local utilities to power the complex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon capture, meanwhile, uses liquid solvents that absorb carbon dioxide from flue gas, or the mix of gases that flows out of an industrial combustion reaction, Flake said. The solvents can also absorb carbon dioxide produced from steam methane reforming, a hydrogen production process that combines methane with steam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solvents consist of an “absorber” that soaks up the carbon dioxide and a “stripper” that produces a concentrated carbon dioxide stream, Flake said. \n\n### Why now? And why Louisiana?\n\nThough many factors affect the fate of industrial projects, a significant driver of Louisiana’s carbon removal push is the dire need to reduce greenhouse gases, state officials have said. Gov. John Bel Edwards has said Louisiana typically ranks around the top five for annual carbon emissions nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other key driver, of course, is money.\n\nBoth Edwards and Flake see carbon capture as an [economic gold mine for Louisiana](https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/business/lsu-professor-industrial-emissions-are-economic-opportunity/article_8299a8ca-ae4b-11ed-a6a2-5b8038b65f66.html). Each LED carbon capture or energy transition announcement brings promises of hundreds of jobs and millions or even billions of dollars spent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Louisiana's nine announced carbon capture projects from 2020 to 2022, the smallest carried a roughly $200 million price tag, according to LED reports. The largest was $9.2 billion for Gron Fuels, the Port Allen-based renewable fuel facility that is also promising more than 5,500 jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 increased tax credits for companies that sequester their carbon dioxide emissions by either direct air capture or carbon capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Cypress will be funded through a direct air capture provision in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, helped usher into law in 2021.\n\nLouisiana also has the infrastructure — and the emissions — to provide a foundation for a carbon removal economy. Carbon dioxide and associated pipeline networks are aplenty, and the geology here is suited for deep sequestration, industry analysts and carbon capture advocates say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The direct air capture is independent of location, but the transport and storage (i.e. sequestration) is a good fit for the Gulf Coast,” Flake said in an email.\n\n### ‘Like trying to mop the ocean’\n\nDirect air capture poses risks similar to carbon capture, environmental advocates say.\n\nIt is “a little bit like trying to mop the ocean,” said Jane Patton, plastics and petrochemicals campaigns manager at the Center for International Environmental Law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatton noted that Louisiana emitted somewhere between 211 million and 219 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2018, according to LSU’s most recent [greenhouse gas inventory](https://www.lsu.edu/ces/publications/2021/louisiana-2021-greehouse-gas-inventory-df-rev_reduced.pdf). At best, Project Cypress will sequester 1 million tons annually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We’re talking about a very big planet here and very small filtration mechanisms,” she said.\n\nPatton said prior direct air capture pilot programs have missed their carbon dioxide sequestration goals while using more energy than promised. In addition, the filtration systems rely on amines and ethylene oxide, which are “very toxic.”\n\nPatton is also wary of the injection aspect of both direct air capture and carbon capture, which requires liquefying carbon dioxide, transporting it via pipeline and injecting it deep under cap rocks within Louisiana’s “sinking geology,” as she put it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“That has not been proven to work reliably anywhere in the world at the scale that industry is promising,” Patton said.\n\nThompson, of the Clean Air Task Force, said he understands the skepticism of direct air capture, but he argued that decades of carbon dioxide injection for oil recovery show “the geology works.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that international studies have called for “massive amounts” of carbon removal technologies by 2050 to prevent further climate catastrophe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I believe that as (people) gain more experience with the technology, more familiarity with the technology, they gain more familiarity with the companies and they gain more familiarity with the regulations, I think that they will be accepting of this,” Thompson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Patton said that justification is being used by industrial companies to spend on technologies that won’t trap nearly enough carbon dioxide. Instead, Louisiana should focus on renewable energy and building efficiency investments that can generate far more quality jobs than carbon removal projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“There are so many more jobs to be found in increasing the energy efficiency of homes and transitioning the grid to renewable and solar — which is a technology that we can deploy immediately with resources from the federal government that is not based on experiments and would not put the people of Louisiana at risk,” Patton said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Louisiana's first major direct air capture project, Project Cypress, is set to receive up to $603 million in federal funding, marking a leap forward for direct air capture in the state.

Our new [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01734-0) shows most of the world's major coal, oil and gas companies are yet to make meaningful reductions.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome companies have been quick to announce net-zero targets or other claims of alignment with the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement). But how do their actions compare to what must be done to achieve the agreed goal of keeping the temperature increase below 1.5°C?\n\n\nOur [research](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/files/RekkerEtAl_NCC2022_RnR2_All.pdf) developed a method to track whether production by individual fossil fuel companies is aligned with putting the world on a 1.5°C climate pathway. We use production budgets as these can be compared directly with fossil fuel demand scenarios and avoid the need for complex emissions calculations.\n\n\nMore than 60% of the top 142 oil, gas and [coal](https://phys.org/tags/coal/) companies—including three of the five Australian companies assessed—were not on track. Rio Tinto and BHP were the two Australian companies found to be on track. Between 2014 and 2020, the fossil fuel sectors exceeded overall production budgets by 64% (oil), 63% (gas) and 70% (coal).\n\n\nThese budgets are the levels of production needed to limit warming to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement \"[middle-of-the-road scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/)\" (where trends broadly follow their historical patterns).\n\n\nWe need freely available information to understand the impact companies are having on the climate and to hold them accountable. Our results are on the website [Are you Paris compliant?](https://www.areyoupariscompliant.com).\n\n\nHow can we track companies' actions?\n------------------------------------\n\n\nIn an earlier [research paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31143-4), we laid the foundation of what Paris compliance means using a strict science-based approach. We developed several conditions.\n\n\nFirstly, the base year of measuring progress of an entity should be the same as the starting year of the decarbonization scenario being used. While there are many such scenarios, the pathway has to be consistent with a 1.5°C or \"well below\" 2°C warming limit as stated in the Paris Agreement.\n\n\nTo prevent constant delay of action, only pathways starting in or before 2015 should be used. That's when the world's nations committed to decarbonization under the Paris Agreement. For example, if a company wants to track its alignment with a well-below 2°C pathway starting in 2014, it should start tracking from 2014.\n\n\nAlso, companies should make up for action deficits since the base year to stay within their budgets.\n\n\nCommonly used frameworks such as the Science Based Targets initiative ([SBTi](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/about-us)) and the London School of Economics' Transition Pathway Initiative ([TPI](https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/)) don't comply with these conditions. The not-for-profit SBTi is the primary point of call for companies wanting to develop emission reduction targets. It's a partnership between [CDP](https://www.cdp.net/en/info/about-us) (which runs the global system of environmental impact disclosures), [UN Global Compact](https://unglobalcompact.org/), [World Wildlife Fund](https://www.worldwildlife.org/) and [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/).\n\n\nWe have now applied our more rigorous approach to fossil fuel companies. Using publicly available production data from the [Climate Accountability Institute](https://climateaccountability.org/) allows us to assess a large number of companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n![Nearly two-thirds of the top fossil fuel producers in Australia and the world aren't on track for 1.5℃ climate target](https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2023/nearly-two-thirds-of-t-1.jpg \"Coal producers were 70% over the production budget needed to stay on track for no more than 1.5℃ warming. Credit: Shutterstock\")\n\n Coal producers were 70% over the production budget needed to stay on track for no more than 1.5℃ warming. Credit: Shutterstock\n  \n\n\nWe evaluated the 142 largest producers of coal, oil and gas against four possible emissions \"[pathways](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/)\" to limit temperature increase to 1.5°C this century. We used three pathways set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014 and the International Energy Agency's [Net Zero Emissions](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-scenario-nze) pathway from 2020. Each pathway involves different scenarios of climate actions, emissions and [carbon capture](https://phys.org/tags/carbon+capture/) and storage.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOff course, with much more to do\n--------------------------------\n\n\nNot only did we find the majority of these companies are not currently aligned, but the outlook is also troubling. If recent trends (2010-2018) continue, the companies would produce up to 68% (coal), 42% (oil) and 53% (gas) more than their cumulative production budgets by 2050.\n\n\nIn Australia, the three companies not on track were Whitehaven Coal, Santos and Woodside. They exceeded their production budgets by 232% (Woodside coal), 28% (Santos oil) and 33% (Santos gas), and 39% (Woodside gas, on track for oil).\n\n\nBHP was on track because it has reduced its coal, oil and gas production *more* than required between 2014 and 2020 under the middle-of-the-road 1.5°C scenario. It used 87% (coal), 85% (oil) and 92% (gas) of its production budgets. Rio Tinto entirely stopped its production of coal in 2018.\n\n\nWhile we project future production using historical (2010-2018) growth, a next step would be to assess how current production plans align with 1.5°C pathways.\n\n\nCompanies can use our method to see how much they need to reduce production to be aligned. They can also see how much carbon capture and storage is required under a certain 1.5°C pathway.\n\n\nTracking enables accountability\n-------------------------------\n\n\nFor companies to claim Paris alignment, they must be accountable for achieving the required levels of mitigation (reducing production and carbon capture and storage) under a particular 1.5°C [pathway](https://phys.org/tags/pathway/).\n\n\nOur method provides a foundation to drive this change. It offers a relatively simple way to measure corporate actions against the reductions required.\n\n\nOur work aids the development of standards, regulation and guidance on what Paris alignment actually means. The Science Based Targets initiative has yet to finalize a method for the oil and gas sector. It has no method for coal.\n\n\nOur method provides a process that can fill this void. In addition to tracking individual companies' compliance with the Paris Agreement, we require clarity on their intentions beyond just setting targets. The International Sustainability Standards Board ([ISSB](https://www.ifrs.org/groups/international-sustainability-standards-board/)) will play a vital role by requiring detailed climate transition plans from companies in countries that adopt its standards.\n\n\nTracking how companies are performing empowers all stakeholders—including governments, investors and individuals like you and me—to advocate for climate action and make climate-safe decisions. For example, investors can use this information to decide which companies to invest in and advocate for change where required. Governments can integrate this information into corporate guidelines for climate action.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n Provided by\n [The Conversation](https://phys.org/partners/the-conversation/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This article is republished from [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com) under a Creative Commons license.

Oil and industry lobbying groups are spending millions in a last-ditch attempt to block first-of-its-kind legislation that would require thousands of large companies doing business in the state to fully disclose their carbon emissions, a move that would effectively set national policy.\n\nIn the final weeks of California’s legislative session, which ends in mid-September, Assembly members are expected to vote on the climate transparency bill. With a federal version of the measure still [delayed](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/sec-eyes-october-for-climate-disclosure-regulations-release) — and nearly certain to face lengthy [legal challenges](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/05/10/secs-climate-risk-disclosure-proposal-likely-to-face-legal-challenges/#:~:text=There%20are%20at%20least%20four,major%20questions%20of%20climate%20change) from industry — California’s legislation could expedite a public reckoning over corporations’ true contributions to climate change.\n\nThe bill has already passed the state Senate, and if it survives a [secretive appropriations hearing](https://calmatters.org/newsletters/whatmatters/2022/05/california-capitol-secretive-process/) later this month, it will go before the full Assembly — where a previous version [failed by just four votes](https://trackbill.com/bill/california-senate-bill-260-climate-corporate-accountability-act/2002689/) last year following a fierce opposition campaign.\n\nCalifornia Gov.

If the measure passes, all of those companies will be required, for the first time, to calculate the carbon emissions that occur across their value chain — not just those involved directly in their day-to-day operations. Such indirect emissions [can account](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/Scope%203%20Detailed%20FAQ.pdf) for nearly 90 percent of a company’s total carbon footprint.\n\n[Most](https://www.delta.com/us/en/about-delta/sustainability#:~:text=We%20are%20committed%20to%20Net,is%20innately%20difficult%20to%20decarbonize.)

But thanks to [fuzzy definitions](https://www.carbonchain.com/blog/net-zero-and-scope-3-how-to-avoid-exxons-mistake) and [accounting sleights of hand](https://www.spglobal.com/esg/insights/carbon-offsets-prove-risky-business-for-net-zero-targets), such voluntary corporate commitments are frequently “mere blather,” according to Michael Gerrard, the founder of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.\n\nTake Chevron, which has [spent $150,000 this year](https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/PDFGen/pdfgen.prg?filingid=2835630&amendid=0) on lobbying, including against the disclosure bill and related legislation. The oil and gas giant’s [“2050 net-zero aspiration”](https://www.chevron.com/newsroom/2021/q4/chevron-sets-net-zero-aspiration-and-new-ghg-intensity-target) depends on “canceling out” emissions through the purchase of so-called [carbon offsets](https://www.spglobal.com/esg/insights/carbon-offsets-prove-risky-business-for-net-zero-targets) that supposedly subsidize climate-friendly projects elsewhere. But a [recent report](https://corporateaccountability.org/resources/chevrons-junk-agenda-report/) concluded that more than 90 percent of those offsets should be “presumed ‘junk’ until proven otherwise.”\n\n“We are awash in greenwashing,” Gerrard said. “We need standards to set forth what a legitimate net-zero commitment is.”\n\n💡Follow us on [**Apple News**](https://apple.news/TeRci1RtoQfWCNA5h7NTBlg) and [**Google News**](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMPvKngswktW2Aw) to make sure you see our stories first, and to help make sure others see our breaking news as well.### As Goes California\n\nMore than a year ago, the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [proposed](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46) rules requiring public companies to disclose [climate risks](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/climate-change-investing-risks-threats-opportunities) to their bottom line, a category that encompasses everything from manufacturing facilities in flood-prone areas to oil holdings that could drop in value as the energy transition proceeds.\n\nThe SEC proposal stops well short of rules [already on the books](https://time.com/6282880/why-eu-climate-corporate-disclosure-rules-matter/) in the European Union, which require companies to report the risks that their business models [pose to the broader environment](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/fisma/items/754701/en), not just investors. But that approach hasn’t stopped the GOP from [attacking the proposed rule](https://www.cfodive.com/news/house-republicans-target-sec-climate-risk-rule-sustainability-esg/642119/) as part of its broader [war against sustainable investing](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/10/house-gop-treads-lightly-in-culture-war-on-wall-street-00104991) and [SEC Chairman Gary Gensler](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-introduce-bill-remove-sec-chair-gary-gensler) for his role in the proposal.\n\nThis month, more than 80 congressional Democrats [sent a letter](https://casten.house.gov/imo/media/doc/casten_castor_vargas_letter_to_sec.pdf) to Gensler urging him to enact the new climate reporting requirements as quickly as possible. A final rule [could come this fall](https://www.verdantix.com/insights/blogs/sec-will-vote-on-climate-rule-in-october-with-potential-to-implement-from-january-2024#:~:text=30%2C%20June%202023-,SEC%20Will%20Vote%20On%20Climate%20Rule%20In%20October%2C%20With%20Potential,31st%20%E2%80%93%20at%20the%20latest.), but the agency is [reportedly mulling](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/04/sec-climate-rule-scale-back-00081181) watering down its requirements. The draft rule drew a [record-breaking 14,000 comments](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/07/03/__trashed-4/) and widespread pushback from business lobbying groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAs its parent organization fights to kill federal rules, the California Chamber of Commerce has led opposition to state climate disclosure legislation [on the grounds that it is “premature”](https://ct3.blob.core.windows.net/21blobs/0cbe1f91-d28a-403a-a3d9-6e3c44627e1b) while those federal rules are pending.\n\nThe state Chamber of Commerce [donated nearly $1.4 million](https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&d-eid=17299&s=CA&y=2022) to candidates for state legislature last year. Defeating the climate disclosure bill, introduced in January by state Sen. Scott Wiener (D), is one of the group’s [top priorities](https://advocacy.calchamber.com/2023/08/16/onerous-emissions-tracking-bill-to-be-heard-in-assembly-committee-today/) this session.\n\nLast year, the bill fell just four votes short of passage when corporate Democrats [joined with Republicans](https://www.levernews.com/why-in-n-out-burger-is-fighting-a-landmark-climate-bill/) to block it on the Assembly floor. Fourteen of the current Democratic Assembly members who abstained or voted “no” last August have received a total of $327,000 from gas and oil interests during the last election cycle, according to data from the National Institute for Money in Politics.\n\n[Donate To The Lever](https://levernews.com/donate)Three of those Democrats — Assemblymembers Joaquin Arambula, David Alvarez, and Jacqui Irwin — changed their “yes” votes to abstentions at the last minute, helping ensure the bill’s defeat.\n\nAsked by *The Lever* about how he plans to vote this year, a spokesperson for Arambula said that he was studying the bill. Alvarez and Irwin did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n“We feel pretty confident that we have a path to passing it,” said Melissa Romero, senior legislative manager for California Environmental Voters, a key backer of the plan. “But our opposition is stacked with the most influential moneyed interests in the state.”\n\nWiener’s bill would apply to more than [5,300 large companies](https://www.ceres.org/news-center/press-releases/companies-call-climate-disclosure-legislation-california-lawmakers#:~:text=If%20passed%2C%20the%20bills%20would,the%20world's%20fifth%2Dlargest%20economy.) doing business in the state, regardless of whether they’re publicly traded, effectively setting new nationwide standards.\n\nNothing in the new measures, should they pass, requires companies to actually reduce their emissions — just to calculate and disclose them. But past environmental regulations, including those [governing the release of toxic chemicals](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program), show that mandatory disclosure is an important first step toward fast and efficient decarbonization, according to Columbia University’s Gerrard.\n\n“It’s a very important part of the toolbox,” he said. “I have very little sympathy for the companies that are complaining about the burdens of this kind of disclosure. These are orders of magnitude lower than the burdens that climate change itself is imposing.”\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Oil and industry lobbying groups are spending millions to block a climate transparency bill in California that would require companies to disclose their carbon emissions.

With enhanced weathering, silicate rock is applied to farmland to capture that carbon before it reaches the atmosphere. As the rock weathers, calcium and magnesium are released and react with dissolved CO2 to produce bicarbonate, essentially locking up the gas and redirecting it harmlessly into groundwater.\n\n\nQuantifying its carbon-capture potential, however, has been a challenge — until now. The Illinois team was able to calculate both the weathering rate and carbon dioxide reduction potential of the basalt rock amendments applied to maize and miscanthus fields. Those factors are critical for efforts to optimize carbon sequestration and for farmers hoping to earn carbon credits.\n\n\n“In addition to reducing emissions, we desperately need effective ways to draw down atmospheric carbon dioxide. Our results suggest that basalt application to farms could be a win-win for farmers and for the planet, improving yields and drawing down CO2,” said study co-author Evan DeLucia, Director Emeritus at the Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE), G. William Arends Professor Emeritus of Plant Biology, and Co-Investigator at the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI) at Illinois.\n\n\nThe breakthrough — the result of a five-year study at the Illinois Energy Farm — was published in [*Global Change Biology Bioenergy.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.16903) The study was led by DeLucia and Ilsa Kantola, Research Scientist at iSEE and the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB).\n\n\nThe work is part of iSEE’s partnership with the Leverhulme Centre at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, which is investigating enhanced weathering for carbon dioxide removal in field sites around the world: Malaysia, Australia, the U.K., and the United States.\n\n\nIn this case, researchers repeatedly applied finely-ground basalt on twin fields at the Energy Farm for four years — one field with a maize/soybean crop rotation and the other with *Miscanthus x giganteus*, a perennial grass that is emerging as a productive bioenergy crop to replace fossil fuels.\n\n\nGrinding the basalt accelerates a natural weathering process that involves two chemical reactions. First, atmospheric CO2 dissolves in rainwater to create carbonic acid. Then, the acid reacts with the rock dust in the soil to form bicarbonate, a soluble compound that leaches with soil water; that redirects the CO2 from the atmosphere to the water cycle, where it can pass harmlessly into waterways and potentially help fight ocean acidification. Basalt contains both calcium and magnesium as well as phosphorus and minor nutrients that are released during weathering and benefit soil fertility.\n\n\nThe Illinois team calculated the CO2 reduction and weathering rate of the basalt by measuring the change in rare earth elements in the soil with the addition of basalt and comparing it to the calcium and magnesium in the system. The rare earth elements are “sticky,” building up in the soil in tiny amounts as more basalt is applied, and calcium and magnesium are released by weathering, with some taken up by the crops. The difference in rare earth elements indicates how much basalt, and therefore how much calcium and magnesium, has been applied; and the difference between the expected amount of calcium and magnesium and the actual amount in the soil tells researchers how much has been consumed by reactions in the soil.\n\n\nThe calculations showed that enhanced weathering reduced net carbon loss to the atmosphere by 42% in maize plots. Paired with conservation tillage or cover crops, the basalt application could turn maize into a net carbon sink. In miscanthus plots, which already stored more CO2 than they emitted before the addition of basalt, enhanced weathering more than doubled carbon storage. The finding adds to the potential climate benefits of this renewable bioenergy crop, one of three targeted by CABBI in its U.S. Department of Energy-funded work.\n\n\nCarbon dioxide removal methods are a critical part of climate mitigation strategies, and as social and political efforts to reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere are delayed, pressure is growing to implement these strategies soon.\n\n\nFarmers, landowners, and others seeking carbon credits all want to know how much basalt rock to apply and how long the effect will last, both of which depend on the composition of the rock and the environmental conditions where it is applied.\n\n\n“As we look for new ways to offset carbon emissions, we need to be able to quantify those carbon savings to better compare our options,” Kantola said.\n\n\nCo-authors on the paper included Professor Carl Bernacchi of the Department of Plant Biology at Illinois, CABBI, and the USDA Agricultural Research Service; Illinois researchers Elena Blanc-Betes of iSEE and CABBI and Mike Masters of ISEE and Plant Biology; Elliot Chang, Alison Marklein, and Adam Wolf of Eion Corp; Caitlin Moore of the University of Western Australia and former CABBI postdoc; Adam von Haden of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and former CABBI postdoc; and Dimitar Epihov and Professor David Beerling of LC3M.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Journal\n\n\nGlobal Change Biology\n\n\n\n\n#### Article Title\n\n\nImproved net carbon budgets in the US Midwest through direct measured impacts of enhanced weathering\n\n\n\n\n#### Article Publication Date\n\n\n17-Aug-2023\n\n\n\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Applying silicate rock to Midwestern farm fields can capture significant amounts of carbon dioxide and prevent it from accumulating in the atmosphere, according to a study.

Credit: KOCIS/Jeon Han.\n\n\nAfrican leaders have been invited to attend the continent’s first climate summit in Nairobi on 4-6 September. The summit has been pitched as a moment to unify Africa’s position on key [climate](https://africanarguments.org/category/african-arguments/climate/) and finance issues ahead of the COP28 climate talks in December.\n\n\nCo-hosted by the African Union Commission and [Kenya](https://africanarguments.org/category/african-arguments/country/east/kenya/), its president William Ruto is calling on his peers to champion a new narrative for climate action on the continent: positioning Africa not as a victim but a bearer of solutions to address the climate crisis.\n\n\nFor that, Africa needs investments that can spur an economic transformation – not aid, he argues.\n\n\n“The rest of us from the African continent we have always been in the corner of problems and victimhood. We don’t want to be in that corner anymore. We want to be at the table where we are all looking for solutions,” Ruto [told](https://www.google.com/search?q=william+ruto+22+june+paris+summit+speech+&rlz=1C1CHBF_enGB1035KE1039&sxsrf=AB5stBjYeAF1xxZUEhCK6o-Lyi-MzwJV4w%3A1690808863270&ei=H7LHZOCSEIeokdUPyq6SuAk&ved=0ahUKEwignrbtgbmAAxUHVKQEHUqXBJcQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=william+ruto+22+june+paris+summit+speech+&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiKXdpbGxpYW0gcnV0byAyMiBqdW5lIHBhcmlzIHN1bW1pdCBzcGVlY2ggMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigAUidDFC4BFixCnABeACQAQCYAY8BoAGEB6oBAzIuNrgBA8gBAPgBAcICBRAAGKIEwgIHECEYoAEYCuIDBBgBIEGIBgE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:dc729e02,vid:hPEb5xONN_s) the Paris summit for a new global finance pact in June.\n\n\nA key part of this shift, says Kenya’s environment and climate change cabinet secretary Soipan Tuya, is to end the “blame game” between developed and developing countries. The priority, she suggests, is to unlock the investments Africa needs to tap into its potential and resources to support global decarbonisation efforts.\n\n\nThis framing has ruffled feathers among climate negotiators and campaigners, who are concerned the summit’s agenda neglects African priorities, such as enhancing adaptation and adopting a mechanism to help poorer countries recover from climate-induced losses and damages.\n\n\nThe optics of the summit, billed as a political moment “by Africans for Africans”, have been made worse by campaigners’ outcry over the involvement of consulting giant McKinsey.\n\n\nMore than 400 civil society groups across the continent have signed [an open letter](https://www.realafricaclimatesummit.org/) accusing the US-headquartered firm of having “unduly influenced” the summit by “pushing a pro-West agenda and interests at the expense of Africa”.\n\n\nIn response, minister Tuya told African Arguments this was “extremely far from the truth”.\n\n\nBecause of the global nature of the discussions, the Kenyan government sought contributions from global players, she says. Consultancy firms “have come and listened to what we are saying and [made] inputs and suggestions. But I can confirm that this is an African position that we are presenting.”\n\n\n**Ruto’s pitch to African leaders**\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nMore than 13,000 delegates have registered to attend the summit at the Kenya International Convention Centre in the heart of Nairobi’s central business district.\n\n\nBarbados’ Prime Minister Mia Mottley and Brazil’s President Lula are among 35 leaders outside Africa who have been invited. Cop28 president designate Sultan Al Jaber and US’ climate envoy John Kerry are expected to attend. As of mid-August, 15 African heads of state and government had confirmed their participation.\n\n\nIn the days ahead, an African Youth Climate Assembly will gather thousands of young people in Nairobi and online to compile their views on how to address climate and development issues. The resulting youth declaration will be handed to leaders.\n\n\nThe summit’s [concept note](https://africaclimatesummit.org/downloads/Africa-Climate-Summit-Concept-Note.pdf) sets out how climate action can drive green growth in Africa by investing in five key areas: renewable energy, green minerals, sustainable agriculture, sustainable infrastructure, and natural capital.\n\n\nClimate adaptation and the finance instruments to unlock such investments have been earmarked as cross-cutting themes. At the end of the summit, leaders will sign the Nairobi Declaration, a document setting out a common vision for achieving green growth on the continent.\n\n\nThe summit further aims to unify nations behind proposals to address the debt crisis and reform the international financial system – an agenda championed by Ruto, who chairs the African Union’s committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change.\n\n\nIn Paris in June, Ruto put forward [concrete ideas](https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/ruto-wants-500bn-credit-line-set-aside-for-weak-economies-4280654) to finance long-term, low interest loans in struggling developing economies and called for new climate finance mechanisms funded with global taxes on fossil fuel, aviation, shipping and financial transactions.\n\n\n“And we want to pay. We don’t want anyone to pay for us,” said Ruto.\n\n\nSome diplomats are concerned these proposals disregard the strongly held principle of common but differentiated responsibilities – the notion that nations bear different degrees of responsibility in addressing climate change based on their historic emissions and income levels.\n\n\nSources close to the summit say the issue is one of messaging: calling for investments and global taxes shouldn’t replace demands on rich countries to deliver on their climate obligations but complement them.\n\n\nFor Hannah Ryder, a Kenyan national and CEO of development consultancy Development Reimagined, Ruto’s proposals offer “a fairly radical remaking of international financial architecture”.\n\n\nBut, she warns, climate negotiators will be reluctant to depart from long-held positions if specific asks are not put on developed countries. “That’s part of the issue for Ruto: what’s the demand on richer countries?” she asks.\n\n\n**“It looks like trade conference on carbon credits”**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe summit is giving a large space to public and private organisations to showcase successful initiatives and connect with investors in “deal rooms” to pitch investment opportunities.\n\n\n“The summit is more of a trade and development summit with African opportunities at the fore,” Kenya’s Tuya told a media briefing earlier this month.\n\n\nThat hasn’t reassured civil society groups concerned about Western influence on the summit.\n\n\nA planning document [names](https://www.uneca.org/eca-events/sites/default/files/resources/documents/ACPC/CCDA11/ACS_Thematic_Teams_Overall_Guidance.pdf) McKinsey as a “technical lead” on the cross-cutting theme of “climate finance”, where carbon markets will be flaunted as a tool to leverage private finance, according to a  [draft programme](https://www.uneca.org/eca-events/sites/default/files/resources/documents/ACPC/CCDA11/ACS_Thematic_Teams_Overall_Guidance.pdf).\n\n\nMcKinsey [helped design](https://www.mckinsey.com/spcontent/bespoke/esg-2023-sean/pdfs/56297_373_mckinsey_esg_report-2022_aw6_v10_final.pdf) the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), which aims to dramatically scale up the voluntary carbon market on the continent. It supported the Kenyan government [assess its carbon credit potential](https://www.context.news/nature/kenya-banks-on-carbon-credits-but-at-what-cost-to-communities) and draft principles for regulating the market.\n\n\nThe consultancy firm is also providing “strategic support” across the energy transition and natural capital tracks.\n\n\nCampaigners have criticised the reliance on carbon markets as a “[false solution](https://www.realafricaclimatesummit.org/)” and [an escape route](https://twitter.com/PowerShftAfrica/status/1691707818485731350?t=Q5-i7ij4qwQ3icf8zj6cpQ&s=08) for companies in rich countries to continue to pollute while trampling over the principles of climate justice.\n\n\n“We had a lot of hope this summit would put African priorities at the heart of climate negotiations, notably adaptation finance. It should have been a summit by Africans for Africans. Instead, it looks like a trade conference on carbon credits,” says Cameroonian activist Augustine Bantar Njamnshi, of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance.\n\n\nOmar Elmawi, co-facilitator of the Africa Movement Building Space, argues that the continent has sufficient capacity and experience to address climate and development issues without having to rely on McKinsey, whose clients include [fossil fuel companies](https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/case-documents/2023/20230622_docket-23CV25164-_complaint.pdf).\n\n\n“Even if McKinsey came in with the best intentions they are coming in with their own biases. They can’t understand Africa better than Africans do,” he says.\n\n\nMcKinsey didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"African leaders have been invited to attend the continent’s first climate summit in Nairobi on 4-6 September.","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"No strong positive or negative sentiment expressed."},{"summary":"Kenya’s President William Ruto is calling on African leaders to champion a new narrative for climate action on the continent.","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_reason":"President Ruto wants Africa to position itself as a bearer of solutions to address the climate crisis."},{"summary":"The summit's agenda has raised concerns among climate negotiators and campaigners who believe it neglects African priorities.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Campaigners are concerned that African priorities such as adaptation and recovery from climate-induced losses are being overlooked."},{"summary":"The involvement of consulting firm McKinsey in the summit has caused outcry among civil society groups who accuse the firm of pushing a pro-West agenda.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Civil society groups believe McKinsey's involvement prioritizes Western interests over African interests."},{"summary":"Kenyan government officials claim that McKinsey's involvement does not unduly influence the summit and that they sought contributions from global players.","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"The Kenyan government believes that McKinsey's involvement is in line with the summit's global nature."},{"summary":"The summit aims to unify African nations behind proposals to address the debt crisis and reform the international financial system.","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"This is a neutral statement of the summit's objectives."},{"summary":"The involvement of carbon markets and McKinsey's role as a technical lead have raised concerns among civil society groups.","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_reason":"Civil society groups believe carbon markets are a false solution and question McKinsey's role."}],"semantic_commentary":"Concerns over carbon markets and McKinsey's role in the climate summit.","sentiment_score":-0.2857142857142857,"classifications":[{"category":"category_d1","reason":"The article mentions the involvement of carbon markets and McKinsey's role as a technical lead, which relates to companies committing to reducing their carbon footprint or indicating that they will be net zero."},{"category":"category_n1","reason":"The article mentions the summit's agenda, which is a news about carbon."},{"category":"category_o1","reason":"The article does not relate to systems, policies, companies, or products that remove carbon from the atmosphere."}]},{"source":"Yahoo News","link":"https://news.yahoo.com/should-biden-be-getting-more-credit-for-his-massive-climate-bill-202920958.html","title":"Should Biden be getting more credit for his massive climate bill?","content":"*“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.*\n\n![US President Joe Biden signs into law H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (climate change and health care bill) in the State Dining Room of the White House on Tuesday August 16, 2022.

It also included a handful of non-climate provisions, including rules to lower the cost of prescription drugs and billions in extra funding for the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nWhile even the president [concedes](https://news.yahoo.com/biden-wishes-signature-climate-law-235804817.html) that the IRA [shouldn’t be credited](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yes-inflation-down-no-inflation-111547060.html) for falling inflation, the bill has already helped drive more than [$100 billion](https://www.axios.com/2023/08/16/how-inflation-reduction-act-ira-money-being-spent) into green energy production and created more than [170,000 clean energy jobs](https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2023/07/Clean-Energy-Boom-Anniversary-Report-1.pdf) — many of them in [Republican parts of the country](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/13/biden-inflation-reduction-act-climate-states-00110940). The White House argues that this is just a preview of the IRA’s full impact, which won’t be realized for several years. One estimate predicted that the bill could result in as much as [$1.2 trillion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bidens-green-energy-law-is-turning-out-to-be-huge-201035230.html) in green energy spending over the next 10 years.\n\nYet despite these massive investments, voters aren’t giving Biden credit for leading the effort to make the bill a reality. More than half of Americans [disapprove](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/07/biden-white-house-climate-policy/) of his handling of climate change, and a strong majority say they know little or nothing about what the Inflation Reduction Act has done, according to a recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.\n\nWhy there’s debate\n------------------\n\nMany political analysts say that stuffing a bunch of individually popular initiatives into a single bill created a piece of legislation too complicated for voters to wrap their heads around. The slow process of launching major energy projects also means that many Americans haven’t yet seen the impact of the IRA in their communities.\n\nBut others say Biden’s real problem is that he’s taking the wrong approach to climate change in the first place. Republicans argue that the IRA is far too large and will end up wasting extraordinary amounts of taxpayer money by imposing the Democrats’ green agenda on the country. Many progressives, on the other hand, say climate-minded voters are disappointed that the bill isn’t nearly big enough and that Biden has undermined his own case by approving fossil fuel projects throughout his presidency.\n\nWhat’s next\n-----------\n\nBiden’s effort to draw more attention to the IRA’s benefits is part of a larger effort to change voters’ minds about his stewardship of the economy, which have remained stubbornly low despite persistent growth and tumbling inflation. Convincing Americans that “[Bidenomics](https://news.yahoo.com/biden-is-claiming-success-on-the-economy-will-voters-buy-it-200453460.html)” is working will likely be a core focus for the president throughout his reelection campaign.\n\nPerspectives\n------------\n\n**Most Americans can’t make sense of such a massive and complex bill**\n\n“I think part of the issue is they have to cram so many things in these giant bills, to get everybody on board and something for everyone to get passed. So it’s really hard for the public to wrap their head around. … It's very, very tricky when it’s hard to know what’s in it.” — Nova Safo, [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart/the-misunderstood-inflation-reduction-act/#mp-episode-transcript)\n\n**Americans aren’t seeing the effects in their everyday lives**\n\n“While the Inflation Reduction Act is bringing dramatic savings to Medicare recipients, and offers rebates and tax credits to consumers for energy-saving home improvements and electric vehicle purchases, nothing in it really addresses the day-to-day expenses most Americans incur, like groceries and gas.” — Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, to [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-inflation-reduction-economy_n_64dd386ae4b06561a9d2ea45)\n\n**The IRA isn’t remotely enough to change our climate trajectory**\n\n“It left the U.S. with no realistic path toward meeting its stated goal of zeroing carbon emissions by 2050. At the rate we’re still pumping planet-heating carbon into the atmosphere, today’s heat waves could come to seem downright pleasant.” — Mark Gongloff, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-14/biden-s-inflation-reduction-act-was-too-tame-on-climate#xj4y7vzkg)\n\n**The IRA is bad policy and voters know it**\n\n“Even if you give the bill the most charitable take possible, it’s just throwing money at failed programs and wasted resources.” — Alex Salter, economist at Texas Tech University, to [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/aug/15/joe-biden-shifts-rhetoric-inflation-reduction-act-/)\n\n**The president has repeatedly undercut his own climate message**\n\n“Biden has also faced the ire of climate progressives for somewhat undercutting his landmark moment with an aggressive giveaway of oil and gas drilling leases on public land … and for incentivizing the use of technologies such as carbon capture that have been criticized as an unproven distraction at a time when the world is baking under record heatwaves.” — Oliver Milman, [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/biden-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act)\n\n**Voters will begin to appreciate the IRA once the projects it’s funding get off the ground**\n\n“I think, over the long run, a lot of these Republican skeptics, they're going to start to see jobs in their district, investments. And I think they're going to come along with the clean energy technologies of the 21st century.” — Leah Stokes, UC Santa Barbara professor of environmental politics, to [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/are-climate-change-and-clean-energy-policies-included-in-inflation-reduction-act-working)\n\n**The media has mostly ignored the actual impact of the IRA**\n\n“I’ve covered a lot of policy fights, and a huge problem in how policy coverage is done is there is all this attention to the fight to pass a bill — the Affordable Care Act, the Trump tax cuts, the Inflation Reduction Act. And then the bill passes. And if the fight stops, attention just drops off a cliff.” — Ezra Klein, [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/podcasts/ezra-klein-podcast-transcript-robinson-meyer.html)\n\n View comments ","summaries":[{"summary":"President Biden held a press conference to celebrate the first anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) becoming law.

Groundwater contamination. Earthquake triggers. One after another, residents from across Iowa fired off their concerns at a meeting with federal and state representatives to discuss a technology that could help protect the climate — and reshape their backyards.\n\n\nHow to handle captured carbon dioxide dominated the agenda at a two-day meeting hosted by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) in Des Moines this spring. Communities that could one day host pipelines filled with carbon dioxide were able to weigh in before regulators as the U.S. begins to deploy carbon capture and storage technology in earnest. The climate solution, championed by President Joe Biden, didn’t get a warm welcome.\n\n\n\"We don't deserve to have these dangerous pipelines that could kill us next to our homes so that these private companies can get even wealthier than they already are,” Des Moines resident Jess Mazour said to applause at the meeting, during which many attendees wore buttons opposing carbon dioxide pipelines.\n\n\nCarbon capture is a catchall term for technologies that trap and store carbon dioxide. In some cases, carbon is sucked from the atmosphere by the emerging process of direct air capture. More common are systems that capture carbon as it is released from fossil fuel burning power plants, heavy industries like steel or cement making, and at sites that process fuels like natural gas. Some of that carbon dioxide can be reused, but more typically it is compressed, transported and injected back into the ground in saline aquifers or spent oil and gas reservoirs.\n\n\nGlobally, only a few dozen carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects have been built, mainly due to uncertain economics and technological complexity. But as those challenges dissipate, early fights in the U.S. — home to the world’s biggest network of carbon dioxide pipelines — could be a harbinger of opposition ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville, Iowa.](https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/08/21/246437.jpg&q=100&f=jpg \"Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville, Iowa.\")](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/08/21/246437.jpg)\n\n Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville, Iowa. \n | Bloomberg\n\n\n\n\n### A carbon capture boom?\n\n\nThe particular pipelines that had Mazour and other Iowans up in arms were designed to transport carbon captured from ethanol plants in Iowa to neighboring states, where it will be pumped about 1.6 km below ground. Those logistics are emblematic: While carbon will ultimately be captured all over the U.S., the storage bins for it — deep geologic formations capable of locking carbon away — are largely concentrated in a few places.\n\n\nAt scale, that will mean long stretches of pipelines crisscrossing the country, an infrastructure windfall that is already attracting intensified corporate interest. Last month, Exxon Mobil agreed to spend nearly $5 billion buying Denbury so it can take control of the company’s 2,000-km network of carbon pipelines, part of the oil giant’s preparations for boom times in CCS.\n\n\nFor companies that operate CCS infrastructure, there is serious money at stake. The [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2023/08/17/japan/bidens-climate-bill-was-too-tame) that Biden signed last year raised the tax credit for CCS to $85 per metric ton — an increase of 70% — in an effort to make costly projects more financially rewarding. That uncapped incentive could pay out billions of dollars to CCS outfits in years to come. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also pledged $251 million in funding to 12 projects that promise to bolster carbon transportation and storage infrastructure.\n\n\nThe scale of government support is indicative of the scale of potential need in the U.S.: it has to capture as much as 1.7 billion tons of carbon each year by 2050 to meet its net zero goal, based on a recent analysis led by Princeton University researchers. That would be an 80-fold increase over today’s estimated U.S. capacity of about 21 million tons, according to the Melbourne-based think tank Global CCS Institute.\n\n\n\"We're already behind on meeting those climate goals,” says John Thompson, director of Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group based in Boston. \"Any delays in moving ahead with carbon capture and storage fundamentally harm all of us.”\n\n\nAs new CCS projects appear on the horizon, more backlash is brewing. In Texas, an alliance of community members and environmental organizations filed a petition in May challenging the approval of a new liquefied natural gas project that would be paired with carbon capture, which opponents derided as \"greenwashing.” In Louisiana, the council of Livingston Parish last year issued a temporary moratorium on a hydrogen producer’s proposal to sequester carbon dioxide near Lake Maurepas, citing ecological and health risks. (The moratorium was later overruled by a federal judge.)\n\n\nDespite rising pushback, \"I don’t think it will get to the point where there is a broad moratorium on the technology,” says Noah Deich, who helps oversee CCS development at the DOE. Local resistance could, however, make deployment more costly if pipeline detours become necessary, Deich says. To ease the tension, the DOE includes community benefit plans as part of its review criteria for sponsoring CCS projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville.](https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/08/21/246436.jpg&q=100&f=jpg \"Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville.\")](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/08/21/246436.jpg)\n\n Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville. \n | Bloomberg\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition to CCS pipelines in some ways mirrors local fights over clean energy projects, which have slowed down deployment in recent years. An analysis published in May by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University found nearly 300 renewable energy projects in 45 states that have encountered what the researchers dubbed \"significant opposition.” Resistance to fossil fuel infrastructure, including pipelines, has also been well documented and widespread across the country. To that end, the CCS pushback also extends to the injection wells where captured carbon dioxide typically ends up.\n\n\nThe protests and permitting fights are already spooking some investors. Alex Tiller, chief executive officer of Carbonvert, which is bankrolling and developing CCS projects in the U.S., says there is a chicken-and-egg problem at work. The owner of a steel plant or ethanol mill may be reluctant to commit to installing carbon capture technology until they know they have pipelines to carry away that captured gas and wells to store it. But investors may be loath to support those carbon pipelines and injection wells until they know they will have a stream of carbon to handle in the first place.\n\n\n\"Those circular references here cause a lot of angst and concern,” Tiller says. \"And people that have a light understanding of the opportunity and the need and the safety around this can easily inject sand into the gears and cause a problem.”\n\n\nSummit Carbon Solutions, based out of Ames, Iowa, plans to build a $5 billion pipeline that will stretch 3,000 km across five states, including South Dakota, whose impacted landowners took the developer to court. They accused Summit of abusing eminent domain, a legal right typically granted to businesses such as railway developers and power grid operators to access private property for public use. The plaintiffs argue that transporting and storing carbon should not qualify as a project for the greater good.\n\n\n\"This is the most united (moment) that our local community has had on issues since probably World War II,” says Mark Lapka, 42, a farmer in McPherson County, South Dakota, and one of the plaintiffs. \"Everybody's pretty much in agreement that this isn't something that we particularly want in our community.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Former U.S. congressman Dennis Kucinich holds a map of a proposed carbon capture pipeline as democratic presidential candidate Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. delivers a speech in Des Moines, Iowa. \n | REUTERS\n\n\n\n\nSummit says it has so far secured voluntary easement agreements covering nearly 75% of its proposed pipeline route and described community support for the project as \"overwhelming.” The company aims to begin construction by the end of this year or early next. But getting the remaining landowners on board could take years of litigation, according to Jennifer Zwagerman, an associate professor of law at Drake University who has studied CCS resistance in the Midwest.\n\n\nThere are regulatory headwinds, too. Earlier this month, the North Dakota Public Service Commission rejected a permit application from Summit for the part of its pipeline project that would run across the state. The government agency said the developer had failed to address concerns raised by local authorities and residents. Summit said it will file a petition for the state’s reconsideration in North Dakota. In Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota and Nebraska, the company is still in the application process.\n\n\n### Pipe down, opposition says\n\n\nThere’s a sharp divide on CCS deployment among environmental groups. A number of organizations, including the Center for Biological Diversity and Greenpeace USA, have joined the anti-CCS camp, voicing concerns that range from the use of the technology by the oil industry to the infrastructure’s environmental impact on communities. Opponents of carbon dioxide pipelines in the Midwest have echoed those anxieties.\n\n\nWhen Susan and Jerry Stoefen found out last year that their land in Iowa sits in the path of a carbon dioxide pipeline planned by Wolf Carbon Solutions, the couple rebuffed company representatives who came by to survey their land three different times. Wolf, based in Denver, is looking to capture carbon from ethanol plants in Iowa and inject it underground in Illinois. Now the Stoefens, both in their 60s, are actively working to stop that project.\n\n\nThe couple made multiple five-hour round trips to Des Moines this year in a (failed) attempt to convince Iowa politicians to block the CCS plan. They also attended at least five community meetings to voice concerns. On a sunny afternoon in May, after picking kale, spinach and radishes from the garden, the Stoefens sat in their farmhouse surrounded by anti-carbon dioxide pipeline signs to explain why.\n\n\n\"People say we have to do something to reduce carbon and we’re all for that,” Susan Stoefen says. But both of them feel that capturing carbon emissions from ethanol production is like trying to treat a malignant tumor instead of removing it. Rather than setting out to make lower-carbon ethanol, they say the U.S. could invest in wider adoption of carbon free technologies.\n\n\nThe Stoefens are also skeptical about CCS in practice. \"I don't believe that the science is correct by pumping CO2 into the ground,” says Jerry Stoefen, a retired plumber who has spent months reading CCS news and attending workshops hosted by environmental NGOs such as the Sierra Club. He says storing captured carbon in geologic formations reminds him of fracking, which has been widely used to extract more oil and gas and has also been linked to earthquakes and groundwater pollution.\n\n\n\"Will this process cause earthquakes?” Jerry asks. \"Will CO2 leach into underground water resources? Will CO2 eventually leach back to the surface and end up in the atmosphere?”\n\n\nIn an email response, Nick Noppinger, senior vice president of corporate development at Wolf Carbon Solutions, said the company has made landowner and community outreach \"a top priority” and is \"actively listening” to their feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Susan and Jerry Stoefen’s land in Iowa sits in the path of a planned carbon dioxide pipeline the couple is working to stop.](https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/08/21/246438.jpg&q=100&f=jpg \"Susan and Jerry Stoefen’s land in Iowa sits in the path of a planned carbon dioxide pipeline the couple is working to stop.\")](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/08/21/246438.jpg)\n\n Susan and Jerry Stoefen’s land in Iowa sits in the path of a planned carbon dioxide pipeline the couple is working to stop. \n | Bloomberg\n\n\n\n\nResearchers are currently looking into questions very much like Jerry’s. Underground injection of carbon dioxide, theoretically, \"could induce seismicity,” Molly McEvoy, an engineer from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said during the PHMSA meeting in Des Moines. She stressed that progress has been made to mitigate this risk: \"We would want to prevent that from happening.”\n\n\nSafety concerns are common among those worried about pipelines in their communities. While carbon dioxide is minimally toxic when inhaled, breathing oxygen-depleted air caused by high carbon dioxide concentrations can lead to suffocation. In 2020, when a pipeline burst in Satartia, Mississippi, at least 45 people were hospitalized and 200 more were evacuated. Cars with combustion engines also failed to start in the oxygen-depleted environment, delaying the emergency response.\n\n\n\"It only takes two minutes at the most to die from asphyxiation,” says Jennifer Winn, 39, a resident of Hawarden, Iowa, who opposes a pipeline that Navigator CO2 Ventures is planning nearby. If the Omaha, Nebraska-based company succeeds, the pipe would be plugged into an ethanol plant 8 km from Winn’s home. \"That is a terrifying thought for me,” she says. \"Our rural emergency response crews don't have the means to save people.”\n\n\nNavigator said it has modeled the potential impact in the event of a pipeline rupture multiple times and has shared a detailed technical overview with emergency response crews across its project footprint. Since January, several hundred first responders across that same footprint have received training specific to carbon dioxide leakage incidents, the company said, adding that it plans to engage more and provide needed equipment.\n\n\nWinn is unconvinced. After living in Iowa for nearly 20 years, she is even considering moving: \"That’s how concerning this is to me.”\n\n\nWhile there have been carbon dioxide pipeline accidents, it is not clear if the larger safety concerns are rooted in data. For every 1,600 km of pipelines built in the U.S., on average only 1.15 leaks or other disruptions occurred over the past five years, according to the PHMSA. Crude oil pipelines have an incident rate more than double that. But the CCS industry also has a much smaller footprint, which could distort its safety record, and little experience building at scale. Federal regulators say they have updated safety rules and are drafting new regulations to further strengthen government oversight of carbon pipelines. But that process will take time.\n\n\n### Unchartered territory\n\n\n\"We’re concerned about the fact that this country has never done this before,” says Brian Jorde, an attorney at Domina Law Group who represents nearly 1,000 Midwest landowners in lawsuits against Summit, Wolf and Navigator.\n\n\nEven if CCS companies succeed in their permit applications, communities get on board with planned pipelines and safety concerns are allayed, there is still an open debate around what carbon capture should be for. When the technology was first developed in the 1970s, it was deployed by oil companies to extract more fuel out of the ground. In 1996, Norwegian oil giant Equinor ASA sunk carbon dioxide in saline reserves to avoid paying carbon taxes. Since then, carbon capture has been blamed for perpetuating oil and gas operations that might otherwise be phased out faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville.](https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/08/21/246436.jpg&q=100&f=jpg \"Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville.\")](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2023/08/21/246436.jpg)\n\n Vicki Hulse and her son Bill Hulse oppose a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline near their home in Moville. \n | Bloomberg\n\n\n\n\n\"Carbon capture is basically a way to keep oil, gas and coal going,” says David Schlissel, a researcher with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \"The longer we rely on fossil fuels, the longer we're going to have climate problems.”\n\n\nExpert opinion here is split. In 2021, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose landmark scientific reports provide the gold standard of climate research, embraced carbon capture as a way to reduce emissions. The International Energy Agency expects the world to capture as much as 7.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide by mid-century. That research seems to indicate the technology is coming whether communities like it or not.\n\n\nA growing number of CCS projects globally suggests the same. The European Union aims to be able to inject as much as 50 million tons of carbon underground annually by 2030. [Japan has rolled out plans](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/01/15/business/economy-business/carbon-capture-projects-japan/) to develop seven CCS hubs on and offshore. Emerging economies from Brazil to Thailand are getting in on the act, too.\n\n\nBut skeptical researchers like Schlissel point to a lingering paradox: Pumping carbon dioxide underground may be a \"quick” climate solution, but regulatory approval and designing and constructing complex CCS infrastructure takes time. \"I doubt many, if any, (CCS projects) would be built by 2030,” Schlissel says. By that point, the U.S. aims to have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 50% compared with 2005 levels.\n\n\nLike many other CCS opponents, Vicki Hulse of Moville, Iowa, has doubts about the technology’s overall climate benefits. She is part of the pushback against the Navigator project, and argues that a large amount of energy needed to construct and operate that infrastructure could potentially cancel out the carbon emissions that it promises to remove.\n\n\nNavigator says the carbon footprint associated with its project will be roughly 1 million tons, which is \"negligible” compared to the 10 million tons of carbon dioxide it could capture and sequester each year. Without specifying the number of easement sign-ups, the company also said in a statement that \"a majority of the impacted landowners are actually supportive” of its project.\n\n\nHulse isn’t one of them. The 67-year-old retiree has fought a series of legal battles against Navigator and has no intention of backing down anytime soon. \"There is absolutely no amount of money that you can pay me to put this underneath my ground,” she says. \"I will fight for it until my last breath.”\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Residents in Iowa are voicing their concerns over the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, particularly the construction of carbon dioxide pipelines.

The SBTi call to action is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments. It drives ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling organizations to set science-based emissions reduction targets, highlighting companies’ competitiveness and sense of responsibility in terms of sustainable development and ESG.\n\n**Background |** LONGi officially participated in the SBTi and committed to set a near-term target in 2020. In the next year, the company published 2021 Climate Actions of LONGi outlining its SBTi targets: by 2030, the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions within the operational boundary is scheduled to reduce by 60% from that of the 2020 level; the carbon emissions of unit silicon material, cell and glass will be reduced by at least 20% compared with that in 2020.\n\n // \\*\\* advertisement \\*\\*//[![Roof Tech](https://cdn.broadstreetads.com/assets/8e29d7a7-b495-420e-b50f-738c4f33f26b.jpg)](https://roof-tech.us/pages/rt-conduit-mount \"Roof Tech\")This year, LONGi’s near-term target has been approved by the SBTi, aligning with the 1.5℃ target in the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn 2020, LONGi also successively joined initiatives of RE100, EP100, EV100 and participated in the SBTi, becoming the first Chinese company to join the four global initiatives all together. From 2012 to 2022, the company had produced a total of 290GW of photovoltaic products, generating over 114 billion kWh of clean electricity. When calculated using the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s Emission Factors, LONGi had helped prevent 536 million tons of CO₂ emissions, equivalent to 1.46% of 2022’s global energy-related carbon emissions.\n\n // \\*\\* advertisement \\*\\*//\n\n\n[Introducing Roof Tech’s newest product, the RT-CONDUIT MOUNT!

To address climate change, apart from setting science-based targets, WNC has also become a member of RE100 and added its signature to the TCFD official website to support the TCFD initiative. WNC's Chief Sustainability Officer Molly Lin noted \"We cannot ignore climate change and the threat it poses to our planet. We must accelerate our efforts in creating a low-carbon industry chain, with the ultimate goal being to achieve net-zero emissions.\"\n \n\n\n The SBTi is a collaboration between the CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The mission of this initiative is to develop tools and guidelines as well as provide technical support to enable businesses to set carbon reduction targets.\n \n\n\n To respond to SBTi's call for urgent action regarding climate change, WNC has set near-term and net-zero targets in accordance with SBTi criteria. Using 2022 as the base year, WNC aims to achieve a 42% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n \n\n\n WNC's strategy for reducing Scope 2 emissions revolves around increasing its use of renewable energy. Specific action items include green power generation for self-use, purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with electricity suppliers. Annual targets to gradually increase the use of renewables will be set, aiming to reach 100% renewable energy usage by 2040.\n \n\n\n Established in 2022, WNC's Sustainable Development Committee works in concert with the company's top-tier managers to formulate sustainable development strategies, plans and targets, with the ultimate goal being to establish a mutually beneficial and sustainable industry environment. Prior to signing the SBTi commitment letter, the Committee had already listed science-based reduction targets as one of its key ESG indicators. Through leveraging advanced R&D capabilities to develop more efficient products and services, using renewable materials, and implementing a supplier management mechanism and product carbon footprint project, WNC is doing its part in reducing emissions, and we hope that in the future our supply chain partners in the network communications industry can also join the SBTi, so together we can work toward reducing emissions and establishing a low-carbon ecosystem for the industry.\n \n\n**About SBTi**  \n\n The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global body enabling businesses to set ambitious emissions reduction targets in line with the latest climate science. The initiative is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi's Net-Zero Standard is the world's first net-zero corporate standard, and the goal of this standard aligns with the recommendation set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.  \n\n\n**Attachments**\n\n* Original Link\n* Original Document\n* Permalink\n**Disclaimer**\n\n**Wistron NeWeb Corp.** published this content on **22 August 2023** and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Exporters from countries such as Brazil or Honduras, among the main suppliers of coffee to the bloc, or Indonesia and Malaysia, key palm oil and rubber exporters, could end up trying to sidestep the regulation by sending goods to countries with less stringent import rules, which would disrupt trade flows. The impact of the law, the first in the world to ban imports of products linked to deforestation, including cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, soya, wood and rubber, will depend on how well the EU addresses its outreach to developing countries.\n\n\n**More room for turbines** – The controversial minimum distance rule for wind turbines looks set to be abolished by the government of Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, as reported by news magazine [Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/windraeder-naeher-an-wohnsiedlungen-nrw-prescht-vor-a-e4da9a0e-a0a1-42a3-82a1-820995eb0096).  The government coalition in the western industrial state, composed of the conservative CDU and the Green Party, is expected to eliminate the rule that turbines must be a minimum distance of 1,000 metres from the nearest residential building, clearing the way for faster renewables expansion and improved energy security. The state’s coalition plans to erect at least 1,000 new turbines in North Rhine-Westphalia during its current term, while chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany as a whole should aim to build up to five new turbines every day in the next few years.\n\n\n***ASIA PACIFIC***\n\n\n**Challenging conditions**– Australia’s government green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, invested A$1.9 bln ($1.2 bln) in new commitments in FY2022-23, including A$1.2 bln in renewable energy and grid-related investment, [the bank announced](https://www.cefc.com.au/media/media-release/cefc-confirms-record-renewables-investment-as-race-to-net-zero-gathers-momentum/), despite challenging market conditions. Investments included bringing forward 14 large-scale solar, wind, and storage projects with a total transaction value of A$5.7 bln. The CEFC completed 30 new and 20 follow-on transaction in the 12 months to June 2023. Lifetime CEFC commitments reached A$12.7 bln across more than 300 large-scale transactions, taking lifetime total transaction value to A$48.8 bln. Private sector leverage also reached an all-time high in 2022-23, with every A$1 of CEFC capital attracting A$5.02 in private sector capital. CEFC CEO Ian Learmonth said the year had been characterised by supply chain shortages and grid constraints for the renewables sector.\n\n\n**Extension**– The Victorian government has secured an agreement with AGL Energy ensuring a 12-year notice period for the Loy Yang A coal-fired power station and mine, with the plant now officially scheduled to close in 2035, [it announced](https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/agreement-secures-transition-loy-yang). The government said the binding agreement avoids uncertainty where the changing plans of power companies can deter new renewable generation entering the market, increasing electricity prices to customers. AGL has agreed to provide a A$50 mln community and economic development fund for affected workers, on top of its rehabilitation obligations. The fund will assist AGL to help retrain, reskill, and find new work opportunities for their staff. The company will submit a rehabilitation plan to the state government in 2025.\n\n\n**Team Korea** – A group of six entities including SK Ecoplant and Hyundai E&C has landed a $447 mln solar power project in Concho County, Texas, the [Korea Economic Daily](https://www.kedglobal.com/energy/newsView/ked202308210006) reports. Under the current plan, a 459 MW solar power plant will be built and be capable of producing 852 GWh of electricity every year for 35 years, according to the report. The Korean alliance also includes EIP Asset Management, solar power company Topsun, state-run Korea Overseas Infrastructure and Urban Development (KIND), and government-backed Global Plant, Infrastructure, and Smart City (PIS) Fund.\n\n\n***AMERICAS***\n\n\n**Ebb excitement** – California startup Ebb Carbon recently began operating its novel ​“marine carbon dioxide removal” system at the Sequim laboratory on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, which uses a combination of electricity and seawater to increase CO2 in the ocean. The technology uses electrochemistry to split saltwater into its acidic and alkaline parts, with the ultimate aim to return alkalinity to the ocean, creating chemical reactions that pull CO2 from the air and store it safely in the sea. Ebb’s first-of-a-kind demonstration project is designed to remove 100 tonnes of CO2 per year at full capacity. The startup is partnering with research institutions including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Washington to understand how to scale up its system for greater impact. ([Canary Media](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/ebb-carbon-wants-to-pull-co2-from-the-sky-with-electricity-and-seawater))\n\n\n**Route revision –** Summit Carbon Solutions submitted a revised request to the North Dakota Public Service Commission for a carbon capture and sequestration pipeline that would avoid the town of Bismarck, avoid game management areas, and regions prone to landslide, the company said in a press release on Saturday. The route’s impact on the town and potential geo-hazards had been raised during community consultation, the company said nearly 80% of the route has been secured through the selling of access rights by landowners. Nearly 90% of the area required for the carbon sequestration site in North Dakota has been obtained. North Dakota’s Public Service Commission earlier this month [denied Summit](https://carbon-pulse.com/215397/) a siting permit for its project, which is part of a large diversified carbon removal forward purchase agreement announced earlier this year.\n\n\n***AND FINALLY…***\n\n\n**Clifi breakdown –** A powerful story can shift perspectives, and help people imagine the future differently. Powerful climate stories could, in that sense, help humanity tackle its biggest challenge yet. [Bloomberg polled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-20/how-to-write-a-climate-thriller-fit-for-page-or-screen) several of the world’s leading climate storytellers to understand what makes for a compelling climate narrative, and what pitfalls are best avoided. All of them argued in favour of a few key principles when telling stories that centre on the environment: Find great characters, keep things realistic (enough), endings matter.\n\n\n**Got a tip?  How

Finance](https://www.eco-business.com/news/series/decoding-sustainable-finance/) series, where we attempt to break down complex terminology surrounding the latest regulations and trends in sustainable finance.*\n\n\nOver half of the global economy, equivalent to approximately US$58 trillion, is moderately or highly dependent on nature, according to a recent analysis by professional services firm PwC. As a result, there is growing expectation among shareholders, regulators and customers for large corporates to disclose their reliance and impacts on nature, and to begin to address them.\n\n\nAt the United Nations [COP](https://www.eco-business.com/tags/cop/)15 summit last December, the landmark [biodiversity](https://www.eco-business.com/tags/biodiversity/) agreement signed by world leaders to protect 30 per cent of the planet by 2030 included a target calling for large companies and financial institutions to “regularly monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity”, in order to reduce their negative impacts while increasing their positive impacts over time. \n\n\n\n> \n> “\n> -\n> \n> \n> It costs nothing to destroy a forest. It costs nothing to use as much water as you want, or to pollute. And therein lies the problem.”\n> \n> \n> David Craig, co-chair, TNFD\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to asset manager Robeco’s 2023 Global Climate Survey, an increasing number of investors said that biodiversity was important or central to their investment policy, and find the loss of nature as great a threat as climate change.\n\n\nYet, many companies are still in the early stages of integrating nature- and biodiversity-related considerations into their commitments and risk assessment frameworks.\n\n\nAdvocacy group ShareAction’s survey of the world’s largest asset managers in June this year found that while almost all of them now have a long-term [net-zero](https://www.eco-business.com/tags/net-zero/) target, only about a quarter of them had made commitments on [deforestation](https://www.eco-business.com/tags/deforestation/). Furthermore, just two-fifths of asset managers surveyed said they monitored areas of biodiversity importance and even then, there was considerable variation in terms of which “key biodiversity areas” they monitored.\n\n\n![ShareAction 2023 Point of No Returns survey](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/ShareAction_2023_Point_of_No_Returns_asset_manager_survey.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nOnly 27 per cent of the world’s largest asset managers surveyed by ShareAction made commitments to end deforestation. Not one had set any specific targets about the conversion of natural ecosystems, or to manage investment risks to biodiversity, that went beyond their deforestation commitments. Source: [ShareAction’s 2023 Point of No Returns](https://shareaction.org/reports/point-of-no-returns-2023-part-iv-climate-and-biodiversity)\n\n\n\nThis need for guidance has spurred several new global frameworks, the most notable being the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), which builds on the work of its climate-related counterpart and is set to become the new baseline standard for nature-related risk reporting. The framework has gained backing from large international corporations like Nestlé, HSBC and BlackRock, and its final version is expected to be released in September.\n\n\n#### What are nature-related risks?\n\n\nNature-related risks are potential threats posed to companies and investors from their dependence and impacts on nature. TNFD has grouped them into three broad categories: physical risks, which arise when natural systems are compromised; transition risks, which result from the changing regulatory, technological, or societal landscape; and systemic risks, which stem from the breakdown of the entire system, such as when tipping points are reached.\n\n\nFor instance, the decline of natural pollinator species and coral bleaching are risks for agribusinesses that rely on bees to pollinate their crops and fisheries that rely on healthy coral reefs respectively. Corporations can also drive nature and biodiversity loss, which alongside changing social expectations, could threaten to destabilise the basis of their operations.\n\n\nThe problem with the current financial system is that it assumes that the natural system is free, said TNFD co-chair David Craig. “It costs nothing to destroy a forest. It costs nothing to use as much water as you want, or to pollute. And therein lies the problem.”\n\n\nTNFD will help businesses and the wider economy price in the detrimental financial impacts from nature degradation by reframing nature as a set of capital assets that provides “ecosystem services” to corporations. This is done by breaking nature down into four realms – ocean, freshwater, land and society – which are further broken down into 34 biomes (areas of land or water with distinct ecosystem services and characteristics).\n\n\nBy putting a value on nature-related risks, it is hoped that businesses and financial institutions using the TNFD framework will start reversing the current declines in biodiversity, also known as achieving “nature-positive” outcomes.\n\n\n#### How do they differ from climate-related risks?\n\n\nNature loss and climate change are closely interrelated and can have mutually reinforcing effects. For instance, nature loss through deforestation – which reduces the amount of carbon sinks for sequestering greenhouse gas emissions – diminishes resilience to climate change, which in turn leads to higher temperatures and drives further loss of nature and biodiversity.\n\n\nHowever, while nature- and climate-related risks are two sides of the same coin, they are not the same. Notably, nature-related risks are much more complex to identify and measure than climate-related risks.\n\n\nUnlike climate change, which can be measured using the standard metric of carbon dioxide equivalents no matter where you are in the world, nature loss is a lot more localised, with no single unit of comparison. TNFD’s framework includes 15 core disclosure metrics – five relating to risk and opportunities and 10 relating to impacts and dependencies – that apply globally and across sectors, excluding additional industry-specific disclosure metrics.\n\n\n“In general nature-related risk is a new topic to organisations and feedback from the market has highlighted a need for the TNFD to go beyond development of disclosure recommendations to also develop ‘how-to’ guidance,” said Marianne Haahr, nature-related finance director of the data-driven non-profit Global Canopy, which is a founding partner of TNFD. This guidance takes the form of the LEAP four-phase approach of how to generate the information needed to disclose nature-related risks and opportunities, she said.\n\n\nThe [LEAP approach](https://framework.tnfd.global/leap-the-risk-and-opportunity-assessment-approach/) – an integrated risk and opportunity assessment developed by TNFD – is short for Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare. It provides companies with a step-by-step process to locate their interactions with nature, evaluate their dependencies and impact, assess their risks and opportunities, before responding and reporting on material nature-related risks.\n\n\n![TNFD 5 core metrics](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/TNFD_CORE_GLOBAL_METRICS_5.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nThe Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures framework’s five of 15 core disclosure metrics relating to risk and opportunities.

Source: TNFD v0.4 framework\n\n\n\n\n#### How does TNFD compare to other standards?\n\n\n**TCFD**\n\n\n\n\nThe TNFD framework may look familiar to corporations that currently report using the Taskforce for Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD). The similarity is intentional. \n\n\n“We reused as much of the TCFD framework as we possibly could – partly because of familiarity and to lower the friction of adoption, and partly because we see that climate and nature are issues that should be dealt with together,” said Craig.\n\n\nThe TNFD taskforce has retained the four pillars of TCFD recommendations – Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Metrics and Targets – with Impact Management incorporated into Risk Management. It has also carried over all 11 TCFD recommended disclosures, to provide a consistent structure for reporting nature-related issues together with climate-related issues.\n\n\nThe notion of “scopes” in emissions reporting across the value chain has also been adapted to the nature context, where Scope 1 refers to direct operations, and Scope 3 refers to upstream, downstream and financed activities.\n\n\n**GRI and ISSB**\n\n\nBased on ongoing engagements with more than 200 businesses in Southeast Asia, Katia Bonga of the World Business Council for Sustainability Development (WBCSD) observed: “The strongest request (from companies) was for the framework to be consistent and as interoperable and complimentary as possible with other standards and guidelines, such as GRI and ISSB.”\n\n\n![TNFD emerging reporting architecture](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/Where_TNFD_fits_in_the_reporting_architecture.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nWhere the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures framework fits in the emerging reporting architecture. Source: TNFD v0.4 framework\n\n\n\nAs in traditional financial reporting, “materiality” in sustainability disclosures determines what a business should disclose to rest of the world. There are two main approaches companies can use to assess what is material to disclose: “single materiality” (or “financial materiality”), which is embodied in the newly launched International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards; or “double materiality”, which is applied in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards that remains the most widely-used global sustainability reporting framework.\n\n\nWhile the single materiality approach only considers the financial impacts of sustainability-related issues to a business, the double materiality approach also includes the firm’s impacts on the environment and society.\n\n\nTNFD’s current framework allows varying approaches to materiality “to accommodate the preferences and regulatory requirements of report preparers and report users from organisations of all sizes and across all jurisdictions.”\n\n\nOn why TNFD has refrained to pick a side in this debate, Tony Golder, executive director of TNFD said in [a recent interview](https://www.esginvestor.net/a-material-risk-to-nature/): “If we pick one over the other, then we will limit the relevance and the attractiveness of the TNFD recommendations. We think that nature risk needs to be considered by everyone around the world.” \n\n\n“We see the TNFD as a tool, we are not writing a standard,” said Golder, who added that the setting new regulatory standards like what governments do – take for instance Europe with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) which has adopted a double materiality approach – is not the mandate of the taskforce.\n\n\n#### How effective will TNFD be in protecting nature?\n\n\nTNFD’s draft framework has been largely well received by market participants. Global Canopy’s Haahr said that the burgeoning nature-related metrics can be leveraged to design new types of products, like biodiversity-linked loans, which could be a new financing stream to reverse nature loss.\n\n\nFor example, Rabobank used existing data that farmers have been collecting for regulatory compliance purposes to launch a biodiversity-linked farmer credit in 2021 that rewards farmers in their loan book for lowering adverse nature-related impacts. Haahr also cited how the forthcoming European Union soil law “will further increase the data available**”** for these types of innovative nature-related transition financial products.\n\n\nBut some investor groups like ShareAction and UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) have cited the need for a clearer definition of materiality and further guidance on how to apply materiality across the framework. ShareAction also recommended that TNFD clarifies that companies should be prepared to disclose all the information collected through the LEAP approch – as the draft framework specifies that not all information needs to be disclosed – should its stakeholders clarify that this information is material.\n\n\nSeparately, civil society groups have raised concerns that TNFD risks facilitating greenwashing. In an [open letter](https://www.banktrack.org/article/the_tnfd_shows_that_global_corporations_will_not_solve_the_biodiversity_crisis) to the TNFD, 62 non-governmental organisations – including BankTrack, Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network, organised by Forests and Finance – said that TNFD’s work is “undermining real solutions to the nature crisis”, notably the work of Indigenous people and environmental defenders on the frontlines.\n\n\nThe coalition asserted that TNFD had failed to include diverse voices in the decision-making process as well as propose disclosures on links to violations of rights, lobbying against laws that help protect nature, and nature-related complaints against companies.\n\n\n“Under the TNFD’s proposed framework, corporate ‘disclosures’ on biodiversity won’t apply if a company is facing allegations of environmental destruction, if it is lobbying against new laws to protect nature or if it is dramatically scaling up how much land it is using. Already we can see the TNFD’s work being championed in ways that distract from, and undermine, the real solutions to the biodiversity crisis,” said Shona Hawkes, advisor, Rainforest Action Network.\n\n\nA TNFD spokesperson has [responded](https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/in-brief/tnfd-responds-to-greenwashing-criticism-from-ngos.html) to the claims in the open letter, saying that they have engaged directly with civil society organisations and listened carefully to their views. “In many cases their feedback and expertise on these issues has influenced the shape of the TNFD’s approach and final draft recommendations,” TNFD said.\n\n\n*What else is needed to support Asia’s green transition?

n-type PV modules generating green power at the world's first photovoltaic self-consumption system in Qilian Mountain National Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClean Parks is an ecosystem co-construction initiative advocated by NIO to support more nature reserves across the world in adopting smart EVs. As for now, NIO has helped construct clean energy infrastructure and formulate clean and low-carbon energy circulation to protect the authenticity and integrity of ecosystems under the initiative.\n\n\n\nWith the support of ASTRO N TOPCon PV modules from Astronergy, the world's first photovoltaic self-consumption system at Qilian Mountain National Park could have an annual average clean power generation of about 670,000 kWh, which could 100% satisfy the electric vehicle usage within the protected area and simultaneously offering powers for 50% of other needs. All these green power outputs result in an estimated annual carbon reduction of around 53 tons.\n\n\nThe V2G self-consumption station is now operational within Qilian Mountain National Park's long-term national research base, providing continuous support for ecological patrols and clean, low-carbon energy utilization within the park.\n\nSaid Samuel Zhang, CMO at Astronergy, at an inauguration ceremony for the PV self-consumption system that Astronergy is working on to practice the slogan – For A Greener World, biodiversity is one of the core insists of the company to help generate greener powers, to operate businesses and to support economic and social developments.\n\nAstronergy is happy and strives to continuously promote PV technology innovation to better serve power stations, promote biological sustainability, promote the establishment of a pollution-free, zero-emission, and high-efficiency new energy development society, and support green and low-carbon transformation, provide strong support for the development of biodiversity conservation, added Zhang.\n\nAs a fresh new try of Astronergy for protecting biodiversity through green PV products, the project will be a new start for the company to cooperate will all possible parties to create a sustainable and net-zero carbon world.\n\nSOURCE Astronergy\n\n![](https://rt.newswire.ca/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C2692&Transmission_Id=202308210458CANADANWCANADAPR_C2692&DateId=20230821)For further information: Jianwei Chen, Phone: +86-13293870806\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n### Modal title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Profile\n--------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### [Astronergy](https://www.newswire.ca/news/astronergy/)\n\n\n\n**Also from this source**\n\n* [Astronergy listed as 2023 overall highest achiever by RETC after rigorous PV module tests](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/astronergy-listed-as-2023-overall-highest-achiever-by-retc-after-rigorous-pv-module-tests-862075180.html)\n* [Astronergy TOPCon modules offering sustainable energy for Singapore F1 race](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/astronergy-topcon-modules-offering-sustainable-energy-for-singapore-f1-race-841309879.html)\n* [Astronergy gains 'Top Performer 2023' title from PVEL](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/astronergy-gains-top-performer-2023-title-from-pvel-807573351.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Cision\n--------------\n\n\n\n* [877-269-7890](tel:877-269-7890)  \n\nfrom 8 AM -

Through this process, we inevitably receive some frequently asked questions. One of which is surrounding our use of futures contracts to gain exposure.\n\n\n\n\nFutures contracts are the most liquid, transparent, efficient, and exchange-cleared way to take a position in compliance carbon markets without giving up any of the impact or price discovery features. Below we will examine tracking, performance, and how futures are ultimately backed by physical allowances.\n\n\n\n\n#### Do futures provide the same experience as the underlying allowances?\n\n\n\n\nFutures contracts are fundamentally intertwined with their underlying markets and, in many cases, ARE the market in the underlying commodity or asset. This is even more true when the futures contract is physically settled, as is the case for carbon contracts. A physical settlement means that when the futures contract matures, the physical carbon allowances are transferred from sellers to buyers, ensuring that the futures contract price always converges with the price of the physical carbon allowance.\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of this mechanism, there is constant arbitrage, the trading of futures versus their underliers, to ensure efficient pricing between the futures contract, the carbon allowance auctions, and the secondary market in physical allowances. This means that the performance and volatility are consistent, and market mechanisms keep them aligned. As such, we strongly favor futures exposure for their liquidity and cost.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s prove this concept using the largest carbon market, the European Union Allowance (EUA) market. The EUA futures market traded $628.9 billion in volume in 2022 compared to a primary auction cap of approximately €136.1 billion ($149.1 billion) and a total number of allowances in circulation of €102.1 billion ($111.9 billion).4 Clearly, based on its substantially larger size, the futures market is the most robust source of liquidity and price discovery.\n\n\n\n\nThe European auctions happen several times per week, settling at a single price per day (US carbon markets have only four auctions per year), whereas the European carbon futures trade intraday each business day. Of course, this means the futures settlement price and auction price are not the same; however, due to the constant arbitrage/efficiency, the relationship holds tight day after day.\n\n\n\n\nTo further show the relationship in price, we charted the difference in daily returns between futures and physical contracts and calculated the 90-day rolling average. As shown in Figure 1, the average price difference is less than one basis point. In other words, the daily change in prices between futures and physical can differ on any given day but ultimately normalize to perfectly track over time.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_1.png)Figure 1\n\n\nAnother method of determining if future and physical price action is truly intertwined is by calculating correlation using historical pricing data. In Figure 2 below, you will see that the futures and physical markets are highly correlated, resulting in a positive correlation of 97%, meaning the price moves are almost exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_2.png)Figure 2\n\n\nSome investors assume that futures markets are more volatile than physical markets; however, this is not true. We observe essentially identical volatility of 45% using daily data and virtually the same using monthly data, with futures at 37% and physical auctions at 35%. \n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_3.png)Figure 3\n\n\nWe can even demonstrate that the much-discussed \"cost of carry\" or \"contango\", the shape of the futures curve that implies the cost of holding a position using a futures contract over time, does not create material drag on an unlevered investment in carbon futures. Figure 4 shows the price difference between auctions (\"spot\") and the forward price (\"futures\"). This demonstrates that the 90-day average \"premium\" that futures trade relative to auctions is less than both the 3-month and 1-year Treasury rates that we earn on the futures collateral. This means that the combined performance of the futures plus the collateral return creates an experience equivalent to holding the physical allowances, except with the liquidity of the exchange-traded vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_4.png)Figure 4\n\n\nNow that we have established that the futures and physical markets move in lockstep, we can illustrate why. It is intuitive because they are not two different markets but simply two elements of the same market. They are entirely interconnected as part of one liquidity ecosystem. The aggregate futures position is backed by a part of the physical \"bank,\" and the price of auctions is as much a signal to futures markets as the futures prices are a signal for auction prices. The futures are where the continuous market pricing is achieved, with auctions being periodic. We illustrate the interconnectivity of the carbon ecosystem below in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://kranesharesnet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chart_5-1.png)Figure 5\n\n\nTo further hone in on their interconnectivity, we discuss how each futures position is backed by physical allowances in the market. It cannot be any other way. There are three scenarios of how our futures positions are backed, and all lead to the same outcome.\n\n\n\n\n2. We buy a future in the market, and a bank takes the other side. They are now short, and their only possible hedge is to buy physical allowances. Their business model is to sell futures slightly higher than the cost of hedging. If they decide to hedge with another future with somebody else, that “somebody” will have to cover with physicals. It doesn’t matter how long the daisy chain is. In the end, the position can only be hedged with physical. So, our long position is making the market net longer and therefore creating a long position in physical allowances at the market level.\n\n6. We buy a future in the market, and a natural hedger takes the other side. That is, an entity such as a power station or bank that is long physical allowances and wants to hedge its risk of a price decline. In this scenario, we have essentially assumed their physical position. They will hold the physical position against their short future that matches our long position. If they decide to use or sell their allowances, they will need to buy back their short futures, which will result in forcing someone else (like in example 1) to take on the long physical position.\n\n10. We buy the future in the market, and a naked short seller is on the other side. A naked short seller in this scenario is someone without a physical position or long exposure selling futures to bet on prices moving lower. In this example, which is less common, it might feel like no one is holding a physical allowance. However, the physics of financial markets ensures they are. Had we not been a long only buyer, the buyer would likely have been a bank or market maker who would then hedge by reducing their physical position. As such, our purchase of futures removed the need for physical allowances to be sold and therefore continue to back our long position.\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter which combinations of the three examples above are applied: our long positions all lead to an aggregated longer position in the actual underlying market. The same is also true of swaps, options, notes, ETFs, and any other derivative. Our KraneShares suite of carbon ETFs, for example, make the carbon allowance market longer an additional $900 million of carbon allowances.\n\n\n\n\n**Positive Impact of Investing in Carbon Futures**\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have covered how both physical and futures-based exposures have the same effect on the market, we can discuss how these long positions have a positive impact. Through both positions, investors help support price discovery and make markets increasingly tighter, making polluting more expensive and incentivizing the decarbonization of various economies, which is the very purpose of the cap-and-trade programs. This impact is powerful and at the heart of our thesis that we can create strong returns while also having a positive impact on our global environment and economy.\n\n\n\n\nSome suggest that holding a long position in carbon leads to the European program canceling additional allowances that permanently stop pollution. However, this is very much overplayed if not entirely incorrect. Holding a position does tighten markets, but it does not cancel them. The EUA cap and trade program does have a cancellation policy in place designed to reduce the number of allowances stored in the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) if the Total Number of Allowances in Circulation (TNAC) is too high. The MSR, for context, is a reserve that has been withdrawing huge numbers of allowances to tighten the market supply. It also has the potential to release those reserves in certain scenarios. The TNAC is simply the sum of allowances auctioned minus those retired. Why is this claim inaccurate? First, the allowances that can be canceled are in the MSR and have already been taken out of circulation and, therefore, not available to polluters. The permanent cancellation versus being locked in the MSR is only a marginal improvement. \n\n\n\n\nSecondly, an investor buying or selling allowances, in any form, does not change the TNAC. For example, if an investor sold their long position in allowances, it wouldn’t increase or reduce the TNAC. It would simply move them from one holder to another, albeit possibly at a lower price. It is the TNAC that determines whether allowances are canceled, so stating that holding physicals over futures has a greater impact is erroneous.\n\n\n\n\nAll of this said, there is no doubt that holding a long strategic position in allowances (again, physical or futures based) means that there are fewer allowances readily available to polluters, forcing these polluters to pay potentially higher prices to source allowances and further encouraging them to reduce their emissions even faster than the program designed.\n\n\n\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n\n\n\nWe've shown that futures and physical are two parts of the same market and create the same price discovery and impact. We take great pride in offering the largest, most liquid ETFs5 to millions of global investors to participate in one of the most effective tools we have against climate change while also providing the potential to generate strong returns.\n\n\n\n\nInvestors can gain access to carbon futures through our suite of carbon ETFs. Our flagship fund, the [KraneShares Global Carbon Allowance Strategy ETF (Ticker: KRBN)](https://kraneshares.com/krbn/), provides a blended basket of the largest, most liquid carbon markets, including the European Union, California, United Kingdom, and the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Beyond our global fund, we also have market-specific funds covering the EU emission trading system through the [KraneShares European Union Allowance Strategy ETF (Ticker: KEUA)](https://kraneshares.com/keua/) and a pureplay on the California program with the [KraneShares California Allowance Strategy ETF (Ticker: KCCA)](https://kraneshares.com/kcca/). \n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about the latest drivers of all these markets in our summer climate report [here](https://kraneshares.com/reports/california-carbons-moment-in-the-sun/).

This and additional information can be found in the Funds’ full and summary prospectus, which may be obtained by visiting:\n\n \n [www.kraneshares.com](https://kraneshares.com/).\n\n Read the prospectus carefully before investing.**\n\n\n**Risk Disclosures:**\n\n\nInvesting involves risk, including possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees. One cannot invest directly in an index.\n\n\nThis information should not be relied upon as research, investment advice, or a recommendation regarding any products, strategies, or any security in particular. This material is strictly for illustrative, educational, or informational purposes and is subject to change. Certain content represents an assessment of the market environment at a specific time and is not intended to be a forecast of future events or a guarantee of future results; material is as of the dates noted and is subject to change without notice.\n\n\n\nKRBN may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify KRBN’s gains or losses. A derivative (i.e., futures/forward contracts, swaps, and options) is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying asset. The primary risk of derivatives is that changes in the asset’s market value and the derivative may not be proportionate, and some derivatives can have the potential for unlimited losses. Derivatives are also subject to liquidity and counterparty risk. KRBN is subject to liquidity risk, meaning that certain investments may become difficult to purchase or sell at a reasonable time and price. If a transaction for these securities is large, it may not be possible to initiate, which may cause KRBN to suffer losses. Counterparty risk is the risk of loss in the event that the counterparty to an agreement fails to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the derivative.\n\n\n\n KRBN relies on the existence of cap and trade regimes. There is no assurance that cap and trade regimes will continue to exist, or that they will prove to be an effective method of reduction in GHG emissions. Changes in U.S. law and related regulations may impact the way KRBN operates, increase Fund costs and/or change the competitive landscape. New technologies may arise that may diminish or eliminate the need for cap and trade markets. Ultimately, the cost of emissions credits is determined by the cost of actually reducing emissions levels. If the price of credits becomes too high, it will be more economical for companies to develop or invest in green technologies, thereby suppressing the demand for credits. Fluctuations in currency of foreign countries may have an adverse effect to domestic currency values.\n\n The use of futures contracts is subject to special risk considerations. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts include: (a) an imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the reference asset and the price of the futures contract; (b) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired; (c) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which are potentially unlimited; (d) the inability to predict correctly the direction of market prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and other economic factors; and (e) if KRBN has insufficient cash, it may have to sell securities or financial instruments from its portfolio to meet daily variation margin requirements, which may lead to KRBN selling securities or financial instruments at a loss.\n\n\nKRBN invests through a subsidiary, and is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiary’s investments. Since the Subsidiary is organized under the law of the Cayman Islands and is not registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as such KRBN will not receive all of the protections offered to shareholders of registered investment companies. KRBN and the Subsidiary will be considered commodity pools upon commencement of operations, and each will be subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC rules. Commodity pools are subject to additional laws, regulations and enforcement policies, which may increase compliance costs and may affect the operations and performance of KRBN and the Subsidiary. Futures and other contracts may have to be liquidated at disadvantageous times or prices to prevent KRBN from exceeding any applicable position limits established by the CFTC. The value of a commodity-linked derivative investment typically is based upon the price movements of a physical commodity and may be affected by changes in overall market movements, volatility of the Index, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity.\n\n\n\n\n KRBN is subject to interest rate risk, which is the chance that bonds will decline in value as interest rates rise.\n\n Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility. KRBN’s assets are expected to be concentrated in a sector, industry, market, or group of concentrations to the extent that the Underlying Index has such concentrations. The securities or futures in that concentration could react similarly to market developments. Thus, KRBN is subject to loss due to adverse occurrences that affect that concentration.\n KRBN is non-diversified.\n\n\nETF shares are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. However, shares may be redeemed at NAV directly by certain authorized broker-dealers (Authorized Participants) in very large creation/redemption units. The returns shown do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Beginning 12/23/2020, market price returns are based on the official closing price of an ETF share or, if the official closing price isn't available, the midpoint between the national best bid and national best offer (\"NBBO\") as of the time the ETF calculates the current NAV per share. Prior to that date, market price returns were based on the midpoint between the Bid and Ask price. NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time.\n\n\nThe KraneShares ETFs and KFA Funds ETFs are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Company (SIDCO), 1 Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA 19456, which is not affiliated with Krane Funds Advisors, LLC, the Investment Adviser for the Funds, or any sub-advisers for the Funds.\n\n\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://kraneshares.com/privacy-policy)\n\n\n[Whistleblower Policy](https://kraneshares.com/whistleblower-policy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are now leaving KraneShares.com\n===================================\n\n\nHyperlinks on this website are provided as a convenience and we disclaim any responsibility for information, services or products found on the websites linked hereto.\n\n\n[Click here to continue](#)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in KRBN Through Your Broker\n==================================\n\n\nYou are now leaving KraneShares.com.

climate finance and environmental products expert, would be the lawyer to infuse one important element into all of the firm’s sector focuses in Asia—energy, commodities, aerospace, shipping,

for Iranian crude over Russian cargoes, as price differentials for Russia's ESPO and Urals crude extend gains amid Moscow's commitment to a 500,000 b/d cut in August crude supply and 300,000 b/d reductions for September.\n\n\nIn agriculture, the US talks with Ukraine’s neighboring countries and Turkey to increase the use of alternative export routes for Ukrainian grains will be in focus as the move is likely to increase corn supplies to China, the largest importer of Ukrainian grains.\n\n\nChina has recently seen damage in its key corn-growing regions with recurring typhoons and an alternative route could cover any supply deficit.\n\n\nIn Asian thermal coal markets, demand is seen coming back with the return of Indian buyers after a long break.\n\n\nOversupply in China’s lithium salt market is likely to keep prices subdued this week. However, prices could increase going into September, having fallen in mid-July.\n\n\nCarbon markets will be watching South Korean price movement, which fell to a record low on a lack of demand and certain participants selling their free-allocated allowances at cheaper levels.\n\n\nMeanwhile, China’s compliance carbon price hit a record high as companies moved early to buy compliance emission allowances to avoid the year-end rush to meet their obligations.\n\n\nI am Shivam Prakash, thank you for kicking off your Monday with S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To continue reading you must login or register with us.\n \n\n\n It’s free and easy to do.

Manufacturing accounted for 39.1% of the total revenue share, driven by the automotive, chemical processing, heavy machinery and equipment, textile, material handling, paper and plastics, maintenance, and electrical and electronics industries.\n\nEnd-user demand for comfortable, good-fit, and technology-integrated respirators is motivating manufacturers to design ergonomically efficient products. PAPRs are some of the most versatile respirators which enable easy technology integration. Moreover, with the increasing awareness about the benefits of PAPRs, and no-fit test requirements for loose-fit PAPRs, it will be the fastest-growing product segment during the forecast period.\n\nGermany accounted for the largest revenue share in the Western European respiratory protection market in 2022. The resurgent growth of end-use industries, a skilled and aware workforce, and higher compliance levels will boost regional growth.\n\nRental programs for respirators currently implemented by some distributors in Western Europe will be considered a viable option by end-user companies and respiratory protection equipment manufacturers in the coming years in response to economic uncertainties. Furthermore, sustainability will gain traction in the respiratory protection market in the coming years. Companies will leverage technology to reduce carbon emissions across the value chain.\n\nStory continues**Growth Opportunity Universe**\n\n* Innovations to Support PPE Manufacturers in Expanding Their Market Presence\n* Businesses Must Focus on Sustainable Development to Gain Customer Trust\n* Vending Machines and Reverse Vending Machines To Generate Traction in The Respiratory Protection Market\n\n**Key Topics Covered:**\n\n**1 Strategic Imperatives**\n\n* Why is it Increasingly Difficult to Grow?\n* The Strategic Imperative\n* The Impact of the Top 3 Strategic Imperatives on the Western European Respiratory Protection Market\n* Growth Opportunities Fuel the Growth Pipeline Engine\n\n**2 Growth Opportunity Analysis**\n\n* Key Findings\n* Scope of Analysis\n* Scope of End-user Industries\n* Market Segmentation\n* Market Segmentation\n* Key Competitors\n* Growth Metrics\n* Distribution Channels\n* Growth Drivers\n* Growth Restraints\n* Forecast Assumptions\n* Product Trends\n* Sustainability Trends\n* Impact Analysis - Sustainability\n* Standards and Regulations\n* Regulatory Trends\n* Revenue Forecast\n* Revenue Forecast by Product\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by Product\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis\n* Revenue Forecast By End-user Industry\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by End-user Industry\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis by End-user Industry\n* Revenue Forecast by Country/Region\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by Country/Region\n* Revenue Forecast by Country/Region\n* Pricing Trends and Forecast Analysis\n* Competitive Environment\n* Revenue Share\n* Revenue Share Analysis\n\n**3 Growth Opportunity Analysis for Disposable Respirators**\n\n* Growth Metrics for Disposable Respirators\n* Revenue Forecast\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis\n* Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by End-Use Industry\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis by End-user Industry\n* Competitive Environment\n* Revenue Share\n* Revenue Share Analysis\n\n**4 Growth Opportunity Analysis for Non-Disposable Respirators**\n\n* Growth Metrics for Non-Disposable Respirators\n* Revenue Forecast\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis\n* Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis by End-user Industry\n* Competitive Environment\n* Revenue Share\n* Revenue Share Analysis\n\n**5 Growth Opportunity Analysis for PAPRs**\n\n* Growth Metrics for PAPRs\n* Revenue Forecast\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis\n* Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis by End-user Industry\n* Competitive Environment\n* Revenue Share\n* Revenue Share Analysis\n\n**6 Growth Opportunity Analysis for SCBA**\n\n* Growth Metrics For SCBA\n* Revenue Forecast\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis\n* Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis by End-user Industry\n* Competitive Environment\n* Revenue Share\n* Revenue Share Analysis\n\n**7 Growth Opportunity Analysis for Airline Respirators**\n\n* Growth Metrics for Airline Respirators\n* Revenue Forecast\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis\n* Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis by End-use Industry\n* Competitive Environment\n* Revenue Share\n* Revenue Share Analysis\n\n**8 Growth Opportunity Analysis for Escape Respirators**\n\n* Growth Metrics for Escape Respirators\n* Revenue Forecast\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis\n* Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Percent Revenue Forecast by End-use Industry\n* Revenue Forecast Analysis by End-user Industry\n* Competitive Environment\n* Revenue Share\n* Revenue Share Analysis\n\nFor more information about this report visit [https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/eg9lpf](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4655854/western-european-respiratory-protection-market?utm_source=CI&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_code=82mvvx&utm_campaign=1880399+-+Western+European+Respiratory+Protection+Markets%2c+2022-2023+%26+2027%3a+PAPRs+Propel+Growth+with+Focus+on+Ergonomic+Efficiency&utm_exec=chdo54prd)\n\n**About ResearchAndMarkets.com**  \nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

OJ\n================================================================================================================\n\n  Today, official publication has been made of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1642, which amends Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1122 with the aim of modernizing the functioning of the Union Registry in the context of the European Union's emissions trading system (EU ETS) and, with a focus on ensuring the accuracy, security, and efficiency of the Union Registry's operations.\n\nThe Union Registry plays a crucial role in managing the trading of greenhouse gas emission allowances within the EU. The initial system, introduced in 2005, ensured accurate tracking of greenhouse gas emission allowances issued under the EU ETS. Over the years, this system underwent changes, with the Central Administrator introducing the European U\n\n    [Read more](#)            ![Eulawlive](https://eulawlive.com/app/images/new-home-2.png)* [News](https://eulawlive.com/tag/news/)\n* [IN-DEPTH](https://eulawlive.com/daily-content/)\n* [Weekend edition](https://eulawlive.com/weekend-edition/)\n* [Podcasts](https://eulawlive.com/podcast/)\n* [Special Reports](https://eulawlive.com/special-reports/)\n* [Bookstore](https://bookshop.eulawlive.com/)\n* [Book Reviews](https://eulawlive.com/library/)\n* [Events](https://eulawlive.com/event/)\n* [About us](https://eulawlive.com/about-us/)\n* [Publish with us](https://eulawlive.com/publish-with-us/)\n* [Our contents explained](https://eulawlive.com/our-contents-explained/)\n* [Our principles](https://eulawlive.com/our-principles/)\n* [Get In Touch](https://eulawlive.com/contact-us/)\n* [Subscribe](https://eulawlive.com/subscriptions/)\n[COPYRIGHT](https://eulawlive.com/copyright-policy)\n\nEU LAW LIVE © ALL RIGHTS RESERVED \n\n* [PRIVACY POLICY](https://eulawlive.com/privacy-policy-2)\n* [COOKIE POLICY](https://eulawlive.com/cookies-policy)\n* [TERMS OF USE](https://eulawlive.com/terms-of-use/)\n* [ABOUT EU LAW LIVE](https://eulawlive.com/about-eu-law-live/)\n\nISSN: 2695-9585\n\n ×  **Your privacy is important for us** \n\n  We use cookies to improve the user experience.

The fast pace at which it expanded since Chinese state-owned Cosco Shipping leased two docks in 2009 – before eventually becoming the port’s majority shareholder – appears to be a thing of the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome would attribute this slowdown to the problems the Covid-19 pandemic created in ports across the world as supply chains were disrupted. Indeed, in 2020, container tonnage in Piraeus dropped for the first time under Cosco.\n\n\nHowever, a closer look shows that ports in Egypt, Morocco and Turkey have seen expanding traffic. The reason? The European Union’s Emission Trading System (ETS), which will be implemented gradually, starting in 2024. Suppliers using the Asia-Europe and other routes are adapting their schedules in order to avoid the considerable extra cost, which will kick in in January 2024, of purchasing credits to offset their carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\nAlthough a large part of the expense will be borne by charterers, the fact remains that transport costs will increase. The large shipping companies plying the regular routes are looking for alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Of course we will have a problem with the introduction of ETS,” a senior Piraeus Port manager tells Kathimerini. However, he remains optimistic that the European Union will understand the danger to trade and will exempt the ports of entry into the European market.\n\n\n“Also, the good relationships we have developed with the carriers and our attractive prices, to the extent that we can offer them, may partially offset the competitive disadvantage that the ETS system will bring,” the manager adds.\n\n\n \n[Shipping](https://www.ekathimerini.com/tag/shipping/)\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Subscribe to our Newsletters\n\n\n\nEnter your information below to receive our weekly newsletters with the latest insights, opinion pieces and current events straight to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![loading](/wp-content/themes/nxtheme/images/loading.gif)\n SIGN UP NOW\n \n\n\n\n\n\nKathimerini may send occasional special offers and promotions.\n\n\nBy signing up you are agreeing to our [Terms of Service](/terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/).\n\n\n\n\n","summaries":[{"summary":"Container traffic growth at the port of Piraeus has slowed down, attributed to the problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_reason":"The slowdown in growth is a neutral observation.
