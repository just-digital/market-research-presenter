The study, based on computer modeling, examined a hypothetical scenario, in which carbon dioxide concentrations continued to rise from present-day levels for 140 years, then were gradually reduced back to the initial levels over another 140-year period.\u00a0\n\nThe researchers were particularly interested in how these changes would affect vulnerable subtropical regions, which are known to suffer from more intense and more frequent [droughts](https://www.space.com/satellite-photos-europe-drought-worst-in-500-years) as [climate change](https://www.space.com/what-is-climate-change-explained#:~:text=Effects%20of%20climate%20change,-Climate%20change%20is&text=As%20climate%20change%20progresses%2C%20these,levels%20will%20also%20keep%20rising.) progresses.\u00a0\n\n**Related stories**: [10 devastating signs of climate change satellites can see from space](https://www.space.com/climate-change-earth-signs-from-space-in-photos)\n\nThe study results suggest that the local climate in these areas would not return to normal for more than 200 years after the carbon dioxide concentrations drop. The Mediterranean region, for example, plagued by ever more severe heatwaves, droughts and [wildfires](https://www.space.com/satellites-greece-wildfires-space-photos), would continue to suffer and could become even drier, the study found.\n\nIn the study, the researchers modeled the changes to the air circulation pattern called the Hadley Cell, which transports moisture from the equatorial regions toward the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which lie at about 23.5 degrees north and south of the equator, respectively. Scientists have known for years that the Hadley Cell circulation responds to climate change by expanding toward the poles. The humid air that rises from around the equator gets dumped back to [Earth](https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html) at higher and higher latitudes, causing worsening droughts in subtropical regions.\u00a0\n\nThe modeling done by the Korean team found that when carbon dioxide is removed from [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.space.com/17683-earth-atmosphere.html), the Hadley Cell doesn't recover its original shape and extent even after another 220 years. In the Northern Hemisphere, the area where moisture arrives from \u00a0tropical regions moves closer to the equator, a shift that could make the Mediterranean region drier than it is today. In the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, the cell remains slightly expanded toward the South Pole, possibly altering precipitation patterns over Australia.\u00a0\n\nStudy lead author Seo-Yeon Kim told Space.com that the unpredictable recovery of the crucial atmospheric circulation pattern has to do with the response of the global ocean to the decrease in temperatures prompted by the carbon dioxide removal.\n\n\"One of the main reasons for this asymmetrical response [of the Hadley Cell] is the different response of the northern and southern oceans,\" said Kim, a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at Seoul National University in South Korea. \"It's related to ocean circulation. The response of the ocean is always slower than the removal of the carbon dioxide, and how fast the ocean responds then determines the recovery of the Hadley Cell.\"\n\nIn the study, the team used current carbon dioxide levels as a starting point and modeled a scenario in which concentrations by a factor of four before being brought back to the base level. They didn't model a return to the levels that were common in pre-industrial times, before humans began burning fossil fuels.\u00a0\n\n[According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/carbon-dioxide-now-more-than-50-higher-than-pre-industrial-levels#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution,atmosphere%20for%20thousands%20of%20years.) (NOAA), concentrations of carbon dioxide rose to 421 parts per million in 2022, more than 50% above the preindustrial era concentrations. Current concentrations of carbon dioxide are even higher than those of the Pliocene Climatic Optimum, a warm period in Earth's history some 4.5 million years ago when sea levels were up to 82 feet (25 meters) higher than they are today, according to NOAA.\u00a0\n\nDespite the warnings of climatologists and political pledges at international conferences, the world still lags behind the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets needed to curb the progress of global warming. The developments are prompting calls that other climate interventions, including [active carbon removal](https://www.space.com/elon-musk-carbon-capture-x-prize), will be necessary to prevent the planet from crossing dangerous warming thresholds.\u00a0\n\nThere are various ways to remove carbon dioxide from Earth's atmosphere, ranging from early-stage technologies that suck the warming gas from the air and sequester it in artificial stone to more natural interventions involving reforestation or fertilizing parts of the ocean to promote the growth of algae.\n\nRelated stories:\u2014 [El Ni\u00f1o is officially here, scientists say](https://www.space.com/el-nino-is-officially-here-2023)  \n\n\u2014 [Climate change may be changing the color of Earth's oceans](https://www.space.com/earth-oceans-change-color-climate-change)  \n\n\u2014 [Climate change keeps space debris afloat longer](https://www.space.com/climate-change-worsens-space-debri-problem)\n\nDevelopments around the globe already suggest that climate change is getting out of hand, with [Antarctica seeing an unprecedented low sea ice extent](https://www.space.com/Antarctic-sea-ice-extent-low-climate-change) during its peak winter period this year, extreme heat waves plaguing parts of Europe and North America and unusually [high temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean](https://www.space.com/climate-change-extreme-marine-heatwave-north-atlantic).\u00a0\n\nKim, however, cautions that the modeling results show that, while carbon removal might reduce temperatures, environmental changes caused by the warming may continue to affect millions of people in vulnerable regions even centuries later.\u00a0\n\n\"I think that the main message of our study is that we should reduce carbon dioxide emissions now, because afterwards it gets really difficult,\" she said. \"We cannot control nature, we cannot reverse the consequences that easily; we cannot fix nature.\"\n\n[The study](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg1801) was published in the journal Science Advances on Wednesday (July 26).\n\n\n"}, {"source": "Mother Jones", "title": "The Clean Energy Transition Is \u201cVulnerable to Abuse by Malicious Actors\u201d \u2013 Mother Jones", "link": "https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/07/commodity-futures-trading-commission-carbon-offsets-market-manipulation/", "summary": "- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is beginning to take a regulatory role in the voluntary carbon offset market in the US.\n- The CFTC recently released a whistleblower alert asking for tips about fraud and manipulation in voluntary carbon markets and established a new Environmental Fraud Task Force.\n- The CFTC's regulatory role is uncertain, but experts call for enforcement actions against market manipulators and holding standard-setters responsible for fraudulent claims.\n- The CFTC's efforts may complement regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission in preventing greenwashing and enforcing consumer protection laws.\n- The CFTC has issued a request for information from the public to gather more input.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryD1", "reason": "The article mentions companies committing to zero carbon emissions using voluntary carbon offsets."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses the regulatory efforts to address fraudulent practices in the voluntary carbon offset market, indicating a positive sentiment towards ensuring the integrity of carbon offset projects."}, "content": "\n\n\n \n\n![A closeup of a US hundred dollar bill (Benjamin Franklin side).](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230726-Manipulation.jpg?w=990)![A closeup of a US hundred dollar bill (Benjamin Franklin side).](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230726-Manipulation.jpg?w=990)Adam Nir/Unsplash\n\n\n*This story was originally published by*[Grist](https://grist.org/regulation/this-little-known-federal-regulator-could-crack-down-on-fraudulent-carbon-offsets/)\u00a0*and\u00a0is reproduced here as part of the*[Climate Desk](http://www.climatedesk.org/)\u00a0*collaboration.*\n\n\nAcross the United States, more and more companies are pledging to zero out their greenhouse gas emissions using \u201cvoluntary carbon offsets\u201d\u2014credits that represent some amount of climate pollution that\u2019s either prevented or removed from the atmosphere.\n\n\nThese credits, bought and sold on unregulated markets that are expected to be worth up to\u00a0[$100 billion by 2030](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/carbon-offset-market-growth), have long drawn criticism for failing to deliver on their promised emission reductions. Some credits come from projects that claim to protect forests that were never in danger of being cut down. Others pull carbon out of the air, but only temporarily, or are susceptible to \u201cdouble-counting,\u201d in which the same credits are claimed by two separate organizations. Experts have described offsets as a \u201c[climate scam](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/17/carbon-offsets-flights-airlines/)\u201d and the voluntary market for them a \u201c[Wild West](https://www.ft.com/content/9b02fcf7-9e04-4b71-ad14-251552d5a78e).\u201d\n\n\nOffsets are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters and then sold to firms and organizations via brokers.\nNow, federal regulatory agencies are beginning to take note. One of these is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, an independent government body charged with ensuring the stability of the country\u2019s derivatives markets. This week, the commission held its\u00a0[second roundtable discussion](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8731-23)\u00a0on promoting \u201cintegrity for high quality carbon credit derivatives,\u201d and other recent actions suggest that it\u2019s gearing up for a more proactive regulatory role in this space.\u00a0\n\n\nLast month, for example, the CFTC released a\u00a0[whistleblower alert](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8723-23) asking the public for tips about fraud and manipulation in voluntary carbon markets\u2014a \u201cprecursor\u201d to bringing enforcement actions against market manipulators, according to Todd Phillips, a fellow at the think tank the Roosevelt Institute. Just a few days later, the CFTC announced a new [Environmental Fraud Task Force](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8736-23)\u00a0within its enforcement division, to help investigate cases of \u201cfraud and misconduct\u201d in offset-related markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is uniquely situated to address this issue,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere really is no one else.\u201d\n\n\nExactly how they\u2019ll do it, however, is uncertain.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, created by Congress in 1974, regulates the US markets for derivatives, contracts between parties in which prices are derived from the value of an underlying asset or benchmark. Such contracts can help hedge against risk; a futures contract, for example, guarantees the price for which a given asset will be sold at some point in the future. Farmers often use these kinds of contracts to guarantee their crops will sell for an agreed-upon price at the end of the harvest, protecting them from a downward swing in the market. Meanwhile, the CFTC\u2019s job is to ensure that the crops actually get delivered, as per the contract.\u00a0\n\n\n![Rostin Behnam, a bald man with light brown skin, speaking from a table](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rostin-Behnam-copy.jpg?w=642)![Rostin Behnam, a bald man with light brown skin, speaking from a table](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rostin-Behnam-copy.jpg?w=642)\nRostin Behnam, chair of the CFTC.\n\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty/Grist\n\n\nThis is all relatively straightforward when it comes to derivatives involving tangible commodities like wheat, which the CFTC has long regulated. But it\u2019s more complicated when it comes to carbon offsets. Offset credits are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters, sold to brokers, and then\u00a0[purchased by a company or organization](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/voluntary-carbon-markets-ecosystem-explained) to count toward their decarbonization pledges\u2014often via a futures contract, if the emissions offset has yet to happen and is promised to occur at some point in the future.\n\n\nCompared to wheat, it\u2019s much less obvious what counts as the legitimate delivery of a carbon credit. Many market participants are concerned that if the underlying commodity\u2014the offset\u2014is based on fraudulent assumptions and does not actually cancel out climate pollution, then derivatives based on those commodities are also fraudulent.\n\n\nThis is already a huge problem; experts have noted \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits. Buyers are motivated by low prices, for instance, and unregulated standard-setters run carbon credit registries that charge fees based on the volume of credits bought and sold, incentivizing them to set looser standards to enable more sales. Already, [millions of rainforest-related credits](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) approved by Verra, the world\u2019s largest standard-setter for the voluntary carbon markets, have been shown to be \u201c[nonadditional](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe),\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t yield additional emission reductions on top of what would have been expected if the credits didn\u2019t exist.\n\n\nExperts cite \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits.\nRobin Rix, Verra\u2019s chief legal, policy, and markets officer, acknowledged at the CFTC roundtable on Wednesday that voluntary carbon markets have characteristics that make them \u201cvulnerable to abuse by malicious actors.\u201d But he said it\u2019s a \u201cmisconception\u201d that voluntary carbon markets lack transparency and said his organization would support \u201ca more muscular approach to fraud and market manipulation\u201d from the CFTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nVerra controls two-thirds of the world\u2019s voluntary carbon markets. The rest are largely dominated by just three other private registries: the Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, and the American Carbon Registry.\n\n\nThe CFTC has so far not waded into this morass, although many experts, advocacy groups, and even private businesses would like it to. Following the commission\u2019s first public convening on voluntary carbon markets last year, dozens of organizations responded to a\u00a0[request for information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/08/2022-12302/request-for-information-on-climate-related-financial-risk)\u00a0by saying that the CFTC should develop standards for carbon offsets that \u201c[effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can serve as underlying commodities for approved derivatives](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CFTC-Carbon-Offsets-Sign-On-Letter-final.pdf).\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nFreya Chay, program lead for the climate data nonprofit CarbonPlan, said such standards should require voluntary carbon markets to clearly distinguish between offsets that\u00a0*prevent*carbon emissions\u2014like if a project developer builds a wind farm rather than a coal plant\u2014and those that *remove* carbon from the atmosphere. She also called for greater transparency around the \u201cpermanence\u201d of removal-based offsets, i.e., how long they will keep carbon locked up. CO2 lasts around 1,000 years in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon credits derived from offset projects like tree-planting\u2014which might only keep carbon sequestered for a dozen years, since forests are susceptible to wildfires and illegal logging\u2014are often treated the same as those derived from geological sequestration, in which carbon is injected into rock formations and is more likely to stay put.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether a definition of what constitutes a high-quality carbon offset will come from the CFTC. Many speakers at Wednesday\u2019s roundtable said that, in order to allow the voluntary carbon markets to \u201creach their full potential,\u201d the commission should leave definitional work to the private sector, perhaps in the hands of an independent body called the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets. One speaker, representing an advocacy group for forest owners, called for the CFTC to only regulate with \u201ca light touch\u201d that allows standard-setters like Verra to continue to \u201cinnovate.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPhillips, with the Roosevelt Institute, said the CFTC should simply hold standard-setters responsible for the claims they make. During the roundtable, he emphasized three words: \u201cenforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201d\n\n\nGroups like Verra or the American Carbon Registry \u201chave standards that say if you meet these standards, your offsets will count as one ton of carbon emissions reduced,\u201d Phillips said in an interview with Grist. \u201cIf they make these assertions while knowing that they\u2019re not true, that\u2019s fraud.\u201d In such a case, the CFTC could impose\u00a0[civil monetary penalties](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/Enforcement/OfficeofDirectorEnforcement.html), freeze assets, or restrict an organization\u2019s trading privileges. The commission could also refer the case to the Justice Department for prosecution.\n\n\nAs carbon markets grow, it\u2019s likely that the CFTC\u2019s efforts will complement or even overlap with work from other federal agencies to prevent offsets-related greenwashing. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example\u2014an independent regulatory agency in charge of protecting investors\u2014has proposed rules that would require companies to disclose \u201c[certain information](https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf)\u201d about offsets they use, although it\u2019s not yet clear what kind of information this would include.\n\n\nSome experts say another agency, the Federal Trade Commission\u2014tasked with enforcing the United States\u2019 consumer protection laws\u2014could step in by including a more concrete (albeit nonbinding) definition of a high-quality carbon offset in its soon-to-be-updated guidelines for environmental marketing claims.\n\n\nPhillips, however, is pinning his hopes on the CFTC, which he said has shown the most interest in bringing enforcement actions. Indeed, commissioners on Wednesday spoke forcefully about the need to clean up the voluntary carbon markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe rapid growth of these markets requires the commission\u2019s careful attention,\u201d Commissioner Kristin Johnson told attendees. \u201cOur common goal must be to adopt a transparent path that effectively prevents double-counting, ensures additionality, and prevents fraud.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe CFTC has issued\u00a0[another request for information](https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7413)\u00a0from the public and is accepting submissions until August 18.\n\n\n\n\n[![More Mother Jones reporting on Climate Desk](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/themes/motherjones/img/topic-banners/climate-desk-642-60.png)](/topics/climate-desk)\n\n\n### \n\n\n\n Looking for news you can trust?\n\n\n*Subscribe to the* Mother Jones Daily *to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Close](#sailthru-signup-widget)\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our [privacy policy](https://www.motherjones.com/about/privacy-policy/) and [terms of use](https://www.motherjones.com/about/terms/), and to receive messages from *Mother Jones* and our partners.\n\n\n\n\n### AN IMPORTANT UPDATE ON MOTHER JONES' FINANCES\n\nWe need to start being more upfront about how hard it is keeping a newsroom like *Mother Jones* afloat these days.\n\n\nBecause it is, and because we're fresh off finishing a fiscal year, on June 30, that came up a bit short of where we needed to be.

According to the latest United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/), achieving that goal will require both large-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and removal of GHGs from the atmosphere.\n\n\nAt present, the most efficient and scalable GHG-removal strategy is the massive planting of trees through reforestation or afforestation \u2014 a \u201cnatural climate solution\u201d (NCS) that extracts atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and soil carbon sequestration.\n\n\nDespite the potential of forestry-based NCS projects to address climate change, biodiversity loss, unemployment, and other societal needs \u2014 and their appeal to policymakers, funders, and citizens \u2014 they have yet to achieve critical mass, and often underperform due to a mix of interacting ecological, social, and financial constraints. To better understand these challenges and identify opportunities to overcome them, a team of researchers at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and the [MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](https://globalchange.mit.edu/) recently studied how environmental scientists, local stakeholders, and project funders perceive the risks and benefits of NCS projects, and how these perceptions impact project goals and performance. To that end, they surveyed and consulted with dozens of recognized experts and organizations spanning the fields of ecology, finance, climate policy, and social science.\n\n\nThe team\u2019s [analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2023.1216175/full?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE), which appears in the journal *Frontiers in Climate,* found two main factors that have hindered the success of forestry-based NCS projects.\n\n\nFirst, the ambition \u2014 levels of carbon removal, ecosystem restoration, job creation, and other environmental and social targets \u2014 of selected NCS projects is limited by funders\u2019 perceptions of their overall risk. Among other things, funders aim to minimize operational risk (e.g., Will newly planted trees survive and grow?), political risk (e.g., Just how secure is their access to the land where trees will be planted?); and reputational risk (e.g., Will the project be perceived as an exercise in \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d or fall way short of its promised environmental and social benefits?). Funders seeking a financial return on their initial investment are also concerned about the dependability of complex monitoring, reporting, and verification methods used to quantify atmospheric carbon removal, biodiversity gains, and other metrics of project performance.\n\n\nSecond, the environmental and social benefits of NCS projects are unlikely to be realized unless the\u00a0local communities impacted by these projects are granted ownership over their implementation and outcomes. But while engaging with local communities is critical to project performance, it can be challenging both legally and financially to set up incentives (e.g., payment and other forms of compensation) to mobilize such engagement.\n\n\n\u201cMany carbon offset projects raise legitimate concerns about their effectiveness,\u201d says study lead author [Bonnie Waring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.waring), a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London. \u201cHowever, if nature climate solution projects are done properly, they can help with sustainable development and empower local communities.\u201d\n\n\nDrawing on surveys and consultations with NCS experts, stakeholders, and funders, the research team highlighted several recommendations on how to overcome key challenges faced by forestry-based NCS projects and boost their environmental and social performance.\n\n\nThese recommendations include encouraging funders to evaluate projects based on robust internal governance, support from regional and national governments, secure land tenure, material benefits for local communities, and full participation of community members from across a spectrum of socioeconomic groups; improving the credibility and verifiability of project emissions reductions and related co-benefits; and maintaining an open dialogue and shared costs and benefits among those who fund, implement, and benefit from these projects.\n\n\n\u201cAddressing climate change requires approaches that include emissions mitigation from economic activities paired with greenhouse gas reductions by natural ecosystems,\u201d says [Sergey Paltsev](https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey), a co-author of the study and deputy director of the MIT Joint Program. \u201cGuided by these recommendations, we advocate for a proper scaling-up of NCS activities from project levels to help assure integrity of emissions reductions across entire countries.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727)\n* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727&title=How%20forests%20can%20cut%20carbon%2C%20restore%20ecosystems%2C%20and%20create%20jobs)\n* [Print](#)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Paper: \"Natural climate solutions must embrace multiple perspectives to ensure synergy with sustainable development\"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2023.1216175/full?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Check for open access version(s) of the research mentioned in this article.](https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/publishing/find-oa-articles/ )\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n-------------\n\n\n\n* [Sergey Paltsev](https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey)\n* [Bonnie Waring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.waring)\n* [Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](https://globalchange.mit.edu/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n--------------\n\n\n* [Climate change](/topic/climate-change)\n* [Agriculture](/topic/agriculture)\n* [Labor and jobs](/topic/labor-jobs)\n* [Pollution](/topic/pollution)\n* [Global Warming](/topic/globalwarming)\n* [Policy](/topic/policy)\n* [Sustainability](/topic/sustainability)\n* [Environment](/topic/environment)\n* [Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](/topic/joint-program-science-and-policy-global-change-0)\n* [EAPS](/topic/eaps)\n* [MIT Energy Initiative](/topic/mit-energy-initiative)\n* [School of Science](/topic/school-science)\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n----------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Sean Anklam and Marcela Angel lead a larger group down a dirt road in a verdant, mountainous area of Colombia](/themes/mit/src/img/placeholder/placeholder--frontpage--featured-news.jpg)](/2023/preparing-colombia-cities-for-changing-forests-marcela-angel-0615)\n\n\n\n### \n[Preparing Colombia\u2019s cities for life amid changing forests](/2023/preparing-colombia-cities-for-changing-forests-marcela-angel-0615)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Aerial view of an abandoned agricultural terrace in France](/themes/mit/src/img/placeholder/placeholder--frontpage--featured-news.jpg)](/2023/3-questions-can-disused-croplands-help-mitigate-climate-change-0519)\n\n\n\n### \n[3 Questions: Can disused croplands help mitigate climate change?](/2023/3-questions-can-disused-croplands-help-mitigate-climate-change-0519)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Horizontal bar graph with six internet apps listed on the y axis and their estimated water, land, and carbon footprints measured on the x axis.

are expected to be worth up to\u00a0[$100 billion by 2030](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/carbon-offset-market-growth), have long drawn criticism for failing to deliver on their promised emission reductions. Some credits come from projects that claim to protect forests that were never in danger of being cut down. Others pull carbon out of the air, but only temporarily, or are susceptible to \u201cdouble-counting,\u201d in which the same credits are claimed by two separate organizations. Experts have described offsets as a \u201c[climate scam](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/17/carbon-offsets-flights-airlines/)\u201d and the voluntary market for them a \u201c[Wild West](https://www.ft.com/content/9b02fcf7-9e04-4b71-ad14-251552d5a78e).\u201d\n\n\nOffsets are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters and then sold to firms and organizations via brokers.\nNow, federal regulatory agencies are beginning to take note. One of these is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, an independent government body charged with ensuring the stability of the country\u2019s derivatives markets. This week, the commission held its\u00a0[second roundtable discussion](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8731-23)\u00a0on promoting \u201cintegrity for high quality carbon credit derivatives,\u201d and other recent actions suggest that it\u2019s gearing up for a more proactive regulatory role in this space.\u00a0\n\n\nLast month, for example, the CFTC released a\u00a0[whistleblower alert](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8723-23) asking the public for tips about fraud and manipulation in voluntary carbon markets\u2014a \u201cprecursor\u201d to bringing enforcement actions against market manipulators, according to Todd Phillips, a fellow at the think tank the Roosevelt Institute. Just a few days later, the CFTC announced a new [Environmental Fraud Task Force](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8736-23)\u00a0within its enforcement division, to help investigate cases of \u201cfraud and misconduct\u201d in offset-related markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is uniquely situated to address this issue,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere really is no one else.\u201d\n\n\nExactly how they\u2019ll do it, however, is uncertain.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, created by Congress in 1974, regulates the US markets for derivatives, contracts between parties in which prices are derived from the value of an underlying asset or benchmark. Such contracts can help hedge against risk; a futures contract, for example, guarantees the price for which a given asset will be sold at some point in the future. Farmers often use these kinds of contracts to guarantee their crops will sell for an agreed-upon price at the end of the harvest, protecting them from a downward swing in the market. Meanwhile, the CFTC\u2019s job is to ensure that the crops actually get delivered, as per the contract.\u00a0\n\n\n![Rostin Behnam, a bald man with light brown skin, speaking from a table](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rostin-Behnam-copy.jpg?w=642)![Rostin Behnam, a bald man with light brown skin, speaking from a table](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rostin-Behnam-copy.jpg?w=642)\nRostin Behnam, chair of the CFTC.\n\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty/Grist\n\n\nThis is all relatively straightforward when it comes to derivatives involving tangible commodities like wheat, which the CFTC has long regulated. But it\u2019s more complicated when it comes to carbon offsets. Offset credits are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters, sold to brokers, and then\u00a0[purchased by a company or organization](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/voluntary-carbon-markets-ecosystem-explained) to count toward their decarbonization pledges\u2014often via a futures contract, if the emissions offset has yet to happen and is promised to occur at some point in the future.\n\n\nCompared to wheat, it\u2019s much less obvious what counts as the legitimate delivery of a carbon credit. Many market participants are concerned that if the underlying commodity\u2014the offset\u2014is based on fraudulent assumptions and does not actually cancel out climate pollution, then derivatives based on those commodities are also fraudulent.\n\n\nThis is already a huge problem; experts have noted \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits. Buyers are motivated by low prices, for instance, and unregulated standard-setters run carbon credit registries that charge fees based on the volume of credits bought and sold, incentivizing them to set looser standards to enable more sales. Already, [millions of rainforest-related credits](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) approved by Verra, the world\u2019s largest standard-setter for the voluntary carbon markets, have been shown to be \u201c[nonadditional](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe),\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t yield additional emission reductions on top of what would have been expected if the credits didn\u2019t exist.\n\n\nExperts cite \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits.\nRobin Rix, Verra\u2019s chief legal, policy, and markets officer, acknowledged at the CFTC roundtable on Wednesday that voluntary carbon markets have characteristics that make them \u201cvulnerable to abuse by malicious actors.\u201d But he said it\u2019s a \u201cmisconception\u201d that voluntary carbon markets lack transparency and said his organization would support \u201ca more muscular approach to fraud and market manipulation\u201d from the CFTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nVerra controls two-thirds of the world\u2019s voluntary carbon markets. The rest are largely dominated by just three other private registries: the Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, and the American Carbon Registry.\n\n\nThe CFTC has so far not waded into this morass, although many experts, advocacy groups, and even private businesses would like it to. Following the commission\u2019s first public convening on voluntary carbon markets last year, dozens of organizations responded to a\u00a0[request for information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/08/2022-12302/request-for-information-on-climate-related-financial-risk)\u00a0by saying that the CFTC should develop standards for carbon offsets that \u201c[effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can serve as underlying commodities for approved derivatives](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CFTC-Carbon-Offsets-Sign-On-Letter-final.pdf).\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nFreya Chay, program lead for the climate data nonprofit CarbonPlan, said such standards should require voluntary carbon markets to clearly distinguish between offsets that\u00a0*prevent*carbon emissions\u2014like if a project developer builds a wind farm rather than a coal plant\u2014and those that *remove* carbon from the atmosphere. She also called for greater transparency around the \u201cpermanence\u201d of removal-based offsets, i.e., how long they will keep carbon locked up. CO2 lasts around 1,000 years in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon credits derived from offset projects like tree-planting\u2014which might only keep carbon sequestered for a dozen years, since forests are susceptible to wildfires and illegal logging\u2014are often treated the same as those derived from geological sequestration, in which carbon is injected into rock formations and is more likely to stay put.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether a definition of what constitutes a high-quality carbon offset will come from the CFTC. Many speakers at Wednesday\u2019s roundtable said that, in order to allow the voluntary carbon markets to \u201creach their full potential,\u201d the commission should leave definitional work to the private sector, perhaps in the hands of an independent body called the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets. One speaker, representing an advocacy group for forest owners, called for the CFTC to only regulate with \u201ca light touch\u201d that allows standard-setters like Verra to continue to \u201cinnovate.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPhillips, with the Roosevelt Institute, said the CFTC should simply hold standard-setters responsible for the claims they make. During the roundtable, he emphasized three words: \u201cenforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201d\n\n\nGroups like Verra or the American Carbon Registry \u201chave standards that say if you meet these standards, your offsets will count as one ton of carbon emissions reduced,\u201d Phillips said in an interview with Grist. \u201cIf they make these assertions while knowing that they\u2019re not true, that\u2019s fraud.\u201d In such a case, the CFTC could impose\u00a0[civil monetary penalties](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/Enforcement/OfficeofDirectorEnforcement.html), freeze assets, or restrict an organization\u2019s trading privileges. The commission could also refer the case to the Justice Department for prosecution.\n\n\nAs carbon markets grow, it\u2019s likely that the CFTC\u2019s efforts will complement or even overlap with work from other federal agencies to prevent offsets-related greenwashing. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example\u2014an independent regulatory agency in charge of protecting investors\u2014has proposed rules that would require companies to disclose \u201c[certain information](https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf)\u201d about offsets they use, although it\u2019s not yet clear what kind of information this would include.\n\n\nSome experts say another agency, the Federal Trade Commission\u2014tasked with enforcing the United States\u2019 consumer protection laws\u2014could step in by including a more concrete (albeit nonbinding) definition of a high-quality carbon offset in its soon-to-be-updated guidelines for environmental marketing claims.\n\n\nPhillips, however, is pinning his hopes on the CFTC, which he said has shown the most interest in bringing enforcement actions. Indeed, commissioners on Wednesday spoke forcefully about the need to clean up the voluntary carbon markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe rapid growth of these markets requires the commission\u2019s careful attention,\u201d Commissioner Kristin Johnson told attendees. \u201cOur common goal must be to adopt a transparent path that effectively prevents double-counting, ensures additionality, and prevents fraud.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe CFTC has issued\u00a0[another request for information](https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7413)\u00a0from the public and is accepting submissions until August 18.\n\n\n\n\n[![More Mother Jones reporting on Climate Desk](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/themes/motherjones/img/topic-banners/climate-desk-642-60.png)](/topics/climate-desk)\n\n\n### \n\n\n\n Looking for news you can trust?\n\n\n*Subscribe to the* Mother Jones Daily *to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Close](#sailthru-signup-widget)\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our [privacy policy](https://www.motherjones.com/about/privacy-policy/) and [terms of use](https://www.motherjones.com/about/terms/), and to receive messages from *Mother Jones* and our partners.\n\n\n\n\n### AN IMPORTANT UPDATE ON MOTHER JONES' FINANCES\n\nWe need to start being more upfront about how hard it is keeping a newsroom like *Mother Jones* afloat these days.\n\n\nBecause it is, and because we're fresh off finishing a fiscal year, on June 30, that came up a bit short of where we needed to be.

Some credits come from projects that claim to protect forests that were never in danger of being cut down. Others pull carbon out of the air, but only temporarily, or are susceptible to \u201cdouble-counting,\u201d in which the same credits are claimed by two separate organizations. Experts have described offsets as a \u201c[climate scam](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/17/carbon-offsets-flights-airlines/)\u201d and the voluntary market for them a \u201c[Wild West](https://www.ft.com/content/9b02fcf7-9e04-4b71-ad14-251552d5a78e).\u201d\n\n\nOffsets are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters and then sold to firms and organizations via brokers.\nNow, federal regulatory agencies are beginning to take note. One of these is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, an independent government body charged with ensuring the stability of the country\u2019s derivatives markets. This week, the commission held its\u00a0[second roundtable discussion](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8731-23)\u00a0on promoting \u201cintegrity for high quality carbon credit derivatives,\u201d and other recent actions suggest that it\u2019s gearing up for a more proactive regulatory role in this space.\u00a0\n\n\nLast month, for example, the CFTC released a\u00a0[whistleblower alert](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8723-23) asking the public for tips about fraud and manipulation in voluntary carbon markets\u2014a \u201cprecursor\u201d to bringing enforcement actions against market manipulators, according to Todd Phillips, a fellow at the think tank the Roosevelt Institute. Just a few days later, the CFTC announced a new [Environmental Fraud Task Force](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8736-23)\u00a0within its enforcement division, to help investigate cases of \u201cfraud and misconduct\u201d in offset-related markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is uniquely situated to address this issue,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere really is no one else.\u201d\n\n\nExactly how they\u2019ll do it, however, is uncertain.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, created by Congress in 1974, regulates the US markets for derivatives, contracts between parties in which prices are derived from the value of an underlying asset or benchmark. Such contracts can help hedge against risk; a futures contract, for example, guarantees the price for which a given asset will be sold at some point in the future. Farmers often use these kinds of contracts to guarantee their crops will sell for an agreed-upon price at the end of the harvest, protecting them from a downward swing in the market. Meanwhile, the CFTC\u2019s job is to ensure that the crops actually get delivered, as per the contract.\u00a0\n\n\n![Rostin Behnam, a bald man with light brown skin, speaking from a table](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rostin-Behnam-copy.jpg?w=642)![Rostin Behnam, a bald man with light brown skin, speaking from a table](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rostin-Behnam-copy.jpg?w=642)\nRostin Behnam, chair of the CFTC.\n\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty/Grist\n\n\nThis is all relatively straightforward when it comes to derivatives involving tangible commodities like wheat, which the CFTC has long regulated. But it\u2019s more complicated when it comes to carbon offsets. Offset credits are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters, sold to brokers, and then\u00a0[purchased by a company or organization](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/voluntary-carbon-markets-ecosystem-explained) to count toward their decarbonization pledges\u2014often via a futures contract, if the emissions offset has yet to happen and is promised to occur at some point in the future.\n\n\nCompared to wheat, it\u2019s much less obvious what counts as the legitimate delivery of a carbon credit. Many market participants are concerned that if the underlying commodity\u2014the offset\u2014is based on fraudulent assumptions and does not actually cancel out climate pollution, then derivatives based on those commodities are also fraudulent.\n\n\nThis is already a huge problem; experts have noted \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits. Buyers are motivated by low prices, for instance, and unregulated standard-setters run carbon credit registries that charge fees based on the volume of credits bought and sold, incentivizing them to set looser standards to enable more sales. Already, [millions of rainforest-related credits](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) approved by Verra, the world\u2019s largest standard-setter for the voluntary carbon markets, have been shown to be \u201c[nonadditional](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe),\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t yield additional emission reductions on top of what would have been expected if the credits didn\u2019t exist.\n\n\nExperts cite \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits.\nRobin Rix, Verra\u2019s chief legal, policy, and markets officer, acknowledged at the CFTC roundtable on Wednesday that voluntary carbon markets have characteristics that make them \u201cvulnerable to abuse by malicious actors.\u201d But he said it\u2019s a \u201cmisconception\u201d that voluntary carbon markets lack transparency and said his organization would support \u201ca more muscular approach to fraud and market manipulation\u201d from the CFTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nVerra controls two-thirds of the world\u2019s voluntary carbon markets. The rest are largely dominated by just three other private registries: the Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, and the American Carbon Registry.\n\n\nThe CFTC has so far not waded into this morass, although many experts, advocacy groups, and even private businesses would like it to. Following the commission\u2019s first public convening on voluntary carbon markets last year, dozens of organizations responded to a\u00a0[request for information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/08/2022-12302/request-for-information-on-climate-related-financial-risk)\u00a0by saying that the CFTC should develop standards for carbon offsets that \u201c[effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can serve as underlying commodities for approved derivatives](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CFTC-Carbon-Offsets-Sign-On-Letter-final.pdf).\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nFreya Chay, program lead for the climate data nonprofit CarbonPlan, said such standards should require voluntary carbon markets to clearly distinguish between offsets that\u00a0*prevent*carbon emissions\u2014like if a project developer builds a wind farm rather than a coal plant\u2014and those that *remove* carbon from the atmosphere. She also called for greater transparency around the \u201cpermanence\u201d of removal-based offsets, i.e., how long they will keep carbon locked up. CO2 lasts around 1,000 years in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon credits derived from offset projects like tree-planting\u2014which might only keep carbon sequestered for a dozen years, since forests are susceptible to wildfires and illegal logging\u2014are often treated the same as those derived from geological sequestration, in which carbon is injected into rock formations and is more likely to stay put.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether a definition of what constitutes a high-quality carbon offset will come from the CFTC. Many speakers at Wednesday\u2019s roundtable said that, in order to allow the voluntary carbon markets to \u201creach their full potential,\u201d the commission should leave definitional work to the private sector, perhaps in the hands of an independent body called the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets. One speaker, representing an advocacy group for forest owners, called for the CFTC to only regulate with \u201ca light touch\u201d that allows standard-setters like Verra to continue to \u201cinnovate.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPhillips, with the Roosevelt Institute, said the CFTC should simply hold standard-setters responsible for the claims they make. During the roundtable, he emphasized three words: \u201cenforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201d\n\n\nGroups like Verra or the American Carbon Registry \u201chave standards that say if you meet these standards, your offsets will count as one ton of carbon emissions reduced,\u201d Phillips said in an interview with Grist. \u201cIf they make these assertions while knowing that they\u2019re not true, that\u2019s fraud.\u201d In such a case, the CFTC could impose\u00a0[civil monetary penalties](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/Enforcement/OfficeofDirectorEnforcement.html), freeze assets, or restrict an organization\u2019s trading privileges. The commission could also refer the case to the Justice Department for prosecution.\n\n\nAs carbon markets grow, it\u2019s likely that the CFTC\u2019s efforts will complement or even overlap with work from other federal agencies to prevent offsets-related greenwashing. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example\u2014an independent regulatory agency in charge of protecting investors\u2014has proposed rules that would require companies to disclose \u201c[certain information](https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf)\u201d about offsets they use, although it\u2019s not yet clear what kind of information this would include.\n\n\nSome experts say another agency, the Federal Trade Commission\u2014tasked with enforcing the United States\u2019 consumer protection laws\u2014could step in by including a more concrete (albeit nonbinding) definition of a high-quality carbon offset in its soon-to-be-updated guidelines for environmental marketing claims.\n\n\nPhillips, however, is pinning his hopes on the CFTC, which he said has shown the most interest in bringing enforcement actions. Indeed, commissioners on Wednesday spoke forcefully about the need to clean up the voluntary carbon markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe rapid growth of these markets requires the commission\u2019s careful attention,\u201d Commissioner Kristin Johnson told attendees. \u201cOur common goal must be to adopt a transparent path that effectively prevents double-counting, ensures additionality, and prevents fraud.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe CFTC has issued\u00a0[another request for information](https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7413)\u00a0from the public and is accepting submissions until August 18.\n\n\n\n\n[![More Mother Jones reporting on Climate Desk](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/themes/motherjones/img/topic-banners/climate-desk-642-60.png)](/topics/climate-desk)\n\n\n### \n\n\n\n Looking for news you can trust?\n\n\n*Subscribe to the* Mother Jones Daily *to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Close](#sailthru-signup-widget)\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our [privacy policy](https://www.motherjones.com/about/privacy-policy/) and [terms of use](https://www.motherjones.com/about/terms/), and to receive messages from *Mother Jones* and our partners.\n\n\n\n\n### AN IMPORTANT UPDATE ON MOTHER JONES' FINANCES\n\nWe need to start being more upfront about how hard it is keeping a newsroom like *Mother Jones* afloat these days.\n\n\nBecause it is, and because we're fresh off finishing a fiscal year, on June 30, that came up a bit short of where we needed to be.

KOKO operates a bioethanol cooking fuel utility that serves approximately one million households across eight cities in Kenya with low-cost renewable cooking fuel, as an alternative to deforestation-based charcoal. In 2021 KOKO was awarded the world's leading emerging markets climate technology solution by *FT / IFC Transformational Business Awards*.\n \n\n\n KOKO is a nine-year old technology company that was founded to solve the challenge of deforestation in Africa, which is driven primarily by charcoal cooking fuel. Customers use their smart canisters to access KOKO Fuel from a dense network of 2,500 high-tech KOKO Fuel ATMs located in convenience stores across urban Kenya. KOKO Fuel burns in modern 2-burner Cookers with a clean blue flame that is a similar experience to cooking with gas, but involving renewable bioethanol cooking fuel produced from sugar molasses. KOKO directly employs 2,000 staff across R&D, technology, manufacturing, utility operations and customer service, with their utility supporting the incomes of an additional 15,000 Kenyan families involved in the bioethanol supply chain. KOKO Cloud manages the flow of payments, fuel and data across the utility to ensure safety, quality and strong customer service.\n \n\n\n Carbon emissions reduced by KOKO are audited in global compliance and voluntary carbon markets, and revenues from the sale of high-quality carbon credits are shared with Kenyan households in the form of significant discounts on KOKO Fuel, enabling the solution to be affordable by even the poorest household segments. KOKO has the strong regulatory support of the Government of Kenya, who have created customized regulations to enable this innovative new energy utility to be built in service of the Kenyan people. KOKO was selected as a \"Lighthouse\" project by the African Carbon Markets Initiative, recognizing the high integrity nature of their business.\n \n\n\n In the GX-League (\\*1), going into full-scale operation in April, 2023, a carbon credit exchange market (GX-ETS) is in a pilot phase, in which the participating companies set and disclose the emission reduction goal voluntarily. In case the domestic Scope1 emission reduction goal is not met, utilization of eligible carbon credits to offset is one of the significant means to achieve emission reduction goal. Recently, \"integrity\" of carbon credits used for offsetting is getting more and more important. Qualitative characteristics of credits such as positive impact on biodiversity and local communities, have become important factors to assess the integrity of carbon credit, not to mention the suitability of the project's operation and monitoring. When using carbon credits to achieve the NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) target defined in Paris Agreement, Corresponding Adjustment (\\*2) is necessary in order to prevent double counting. It is said that correspondingly adjusted carbon credits are likely to be GX-ETS eligible.\n \n\n\n ITOCHU has become a financier of KOKO to support the expansion of its business in Kenya, and will jointly market a portion of KOKO's credits. Making use of ITOCHU's global network of customers in a wide range of industries, it will contribute to the decarbonization of society and clients by supporting carbon credit trading particularly in Japan and other Asian countries\n \n\n\n At the same time, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (Headquarters: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo; President & CEO: Masahiko Kato; hereinafter \"Mizuho Bank\") concluded a Memorandum of Understanding with KOKO to support the marketing of KOKO credits to Mizuho's client base.

A critical factor in this ambitious [climate change](https://www.earth.com/news/lighter-colored-and-smaller-winged-tropical-butterflies-are-at-greater-climate-change-risk/) goal is achieving net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 2050, alongside considerably reducing methane and other greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nImmediate action is needed\n--------------------------\n\n\n\nThe SFU study, published in the journal [*Communications Earth & Environment*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00898-z), advances an argument for immediate, global-scale methane mitigation efforts to be initiated before the decade ends, if we wish to contain global warming levels below the 2\u00b0C benchmark relative to pre-industrial times.\n\nThe researchers caution against any postponement of these efforts, warning that any delay in methane mitigation actions beyond 2040 would escalate the risk of global warming levels surging past the 2\u00b0C mark \u2013 this holds true even if we successfully achieve net-zero CO2 emissions.\n\nMethane mitigation\n------------------\n\nOver the past two centuries, methane has been the second-largest contributor (after CO2) to global temperature increases. Human activities are responsible for over 60% of global methane emissions in the past four decades, largely stemming from fossil fuel exploitation, livestock production, agriculture, and waste disposal.\n\nStudy co-author Kirsten Zickfeld is a distinguished professor of climate science and director of SFU\u2019s Climate Research Lab. She stressed the urgency of the matter: \u201cWe emphasize that actions associated with the [Global Methane Pledge](https://www.globalmethanepledge.org/) should not be delayed, because every year of delayed methane mitigation implies further global warming.\u201d\n\nStudy lead author Claude-Michel Nzotungicimpaye is a former PhD student at SFU and a researcher on Zickfeld\u2019s team. He emphasized the need for policymakers to prioritize methane mitigation.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhile policymakers now accept the need for urgent methane mitigation, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of immediate mitigation to comply with the temperature goal in the Paris Agreement \u2013 particularly taking into account potential Earth system feedbacks,\u201d said Nzotungicimpaye.\n\nFocus of the study\n------------------\n\nThe SFU team adopted a novel approach in their study, employing an Earth system model with an integrated methane cycle to probe the impact of immediate versus delayed methane mitigation in achieving the 2\u00b0C threshold.\u00a0\n\nThey explored the role of feedback in carbon and methane cycles and the potential long-term climate impacts of procrastination or failure to tackle methane emissions in the current century \u2013 a topic that has remained relatively uncharted territory until now.\n\nShocking results\n----------------\n\nWhat the study uncovers is profound: for every 10-year delay in methane mitigation there is in an increase of about 0.1\u00b0C in peak global warming temperature.\n\nThe findings of the study bring into sharp focus the necessity for immediate and extensive reductions in anthropogenic methane emissions worldwide. In tandem with stringent CO2 mitigation measures, these concerted efforts could maximize the chances of capping the rise in average global temperatures at well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, thereby fulfilling the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSources of methane\n------------------\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential many times greater than that of carbon dioxide, although it\u2019s less abundant in the atmosphere. There are several key sources of methane emissions:\n\n### Agriculture\n\nLivestock production, especially from ruminants such as cows and sheep, is a significant source of methane. The animals produce methane as part of their digestive process, which is then released into the atmosphere. Rice cultivation is another agricultural source of methane, as the flooded paddy fields provide an ideal environment for methane-producing microbes.\n\n### Fossil fuels\n\nThe extraction, transportation, and use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, are significant contributors to methane emissions. Methane is the main component of natural gas, and it often leaks from wells, pipelines, and other infrastructure.\n\n### Waste management\n\nLandfills are sources of methane, as organic waste (like food and yard waste) decomposes anaerobically (without oxygen) and produces methane. Wastewater treatment facilities can also release methane.\n\n### Biomass burning\n\nWhen trees, plants, or other organic matter is burned, methane is released into the atmosphere. This happens frequently in forest fires, agricultural burning, and residential wood burning.\n\n### Wetlands and other natural sources\n\nNatural sources contribute a significant portion of global methane emissions. Wetlands are the largest natural source, as the moist, low-oxygen conditions are ideal for methane-producing microbes.\n\n### Permafrost and hydrates\n\nMethane can be trapped in permafrost and hydrates (a type of ice that contains methane). As global temperatures rise and these structures melt, the trapped methane can be released into the atmosphere.\n\n### Termites\n\nTermites produce methane as a byproduct of their digestion process, similar to livestock.\n\n\u2014-\n\nCheck us out on [EarthSnap](https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/), a free app brought to you by [Eric Ralls](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/) and

In this case, it would be in the soil, where most of the world\u2019s carbon is stored.\n\n\nThis year\u2019s conservation summit continued to focus on the work Copper is doing to increase biodiversity on its slopes, but it also allowed other nearby ski resorts like Arapahoe Basin Ski Area, Eldora Mountain and Sunlight Mountain Resort to share their insights on climate change and the preventive measures they are taking to curb its effects.\u00a0Copper Mountain senior\u00a0[resort operations and sustainability manager Jeff Grasser](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/copper-mountain-employee-recognized-for-native-seed-collecting-program-and-other-sustainability-efforts/)\u00a0talked a little about the goal of the summit.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\u201cStarting a conversation within this industry \u2014 as well as others \u2014 about conserving the land,\u201d said Grasser. \u201cI see within our society, at Copper and our industry that we can do more to conserve the ecosystems that are businesses rely on.\u201d\n\n\nGrasser began the summit by highlighting how Copper has worked over the last few seasons to increase the biodiversity on the mountain in an ecologically smart way.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2020/03/VD-logo-white.png)\n\n### Support Local Journalism\n\nDonate\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nOne way that resort and other local officials have been working to increase the biodiversity over the last few seasons is by\u00a0[collecting native seeds](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/copper-mountain-employee-recognized-for-native-seed-collecting-program-and-other-sustainability-efforts/)and replanting them in areas that see wear and tear from winter and summer activities.\n\n\nIn 2022, Grasser and his sustainability team gathered seeds from 27 native species, replanting them in areas that were in need of advanced restoration in order to facilitate\u00a0[ecological succession](https://www.britannica.com/science/ecological-succession), allowing a larger variety of plants to establish themselves on the mountain.\n\n\nAccording to Grasser, local ski slopes tend to be stuck in a phase of\u00a0[primary succession](https://www.britannica.com/science/primary-succession), where the slope often looks barren with little more than a few plant species, because of constant recreation and disturbance. Copper\u2019s native seed collection program is slowly changing the amount of slopes that are in a stage of primary succession by introducing its native seed mix to the area, sparking the beginning stages of advanced restoration.\n\n\nBeyond the seed collection program, Grasser and Southwestern University\u2019s Dr. Jennie DeMarco gave an update on the resort\u2019s carbon sequestration program.\n\n\nOver the first year of the program, Copper Mountain\u2019s sustainability team and students from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, analyzed plant species compositions, soil health properties and carbon pools.\n\n\nWith the program now in its second year, Copper Mountain has made minor adjustments to the study by starting to experiment with a biochar \u2014 a lightweight black residue made of carbon and ashes from fallen or removed lodgepole pine and aspen trees.\n\n\nThe Copper Mountain team has been adding this biochar to sample plots that have been designated for the carbon sequestration study to see any effect it may have in developing a more diverse ecosystem.\n\n\n\u201cThis year we added the addition of treatment,\u201d Grasser said. \u201cWe have a control that just gets sampled, we have a second plot that gets seeded with our native biodiversity mix, a third plot that gets seed plus compost and now we are adding a fourth plot that is getting seeds plus biochar.\u201d\n\n\nIn the next several years, the sustainability team and Southwestern University students will have comparative data from the sample plots, which will allow them to be able to make more informed decisions in their efforts to improve the long-term health of the ecosystems that make up the resort area.\u00a0\n\n\nOutside of Copper Mountain, Colorado\u2019s Arapahoe Basin Ski Area, Eldora Mountain Resort and Sunlight Mountain\u00a0Ski Resort have also put in energy, time and money in their own sustainability efforts.\u00a0\n\n\nIn recent years, A-Basin has focused on sustainability while also building out the ski area\u2019s new mountain biking and hiking trails by re-sodding areas of the mountain and creating environmentally conscious mountain spring crossings.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nA-Basin\u00a0and Eldora have also spent time restoring and conserving the wetlands that run through or near their ski areas.\u00a0\n\n\nThrough the excavation of gravel and the planting of seedlings and saplings, both A-Basin and Eldora have been able to create areas where water can pool, helping to restore wetland areas near both ski resorts. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe hope for A-Basin and Eldora Mountain sustainability managers Mike Nathan and Hunter Wright is that these new wetland ecosystems will continue to grow and prosper in the coming seasons so the areas can once again house a diverse array of plants, insects and animal species.\n\n\nA Sunlight representative concluded the day by explaining what the ski area has been doing to help revegetate high-use areas of the mountain located between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale.\n\n\nAccording to Mica Selby, assistant general manager of human resources at Sunlight Mountain Resort, the ski area keeps a firm relationship with the U.S. Forest Service and draws up and adapts revegetation plans that can best serve the mountain.\n\n\nWith a small mountain sustainability team, Sunlight has successfully revegetated places on the mountain that were sparse due to high-volume use. In the future, the resort hopes to keep up with its revegetation efforts while also working towards better controlling erosion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n### This story is from [SummitDaily.com](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/__trashed-3/).\n\n\n "}, {"source": "MIT News", "title": "How forests can cut carbon, restore ecosystems, and create jobs", "link": "https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727", "summary": "- Reforestation and afforestation are \"natural climate solutions\" that can help cut carbon, restore ecosystems, create jobs, and provide other environmental and social benefits.\n- The success of forestry-based NCS projects is hindered by funders' perceptions of overall risk and the lack of ownership and engagement from local communities.\n- Recommendations to overcome these challenges include evaluating projects based on robust governance, secure land tenure, and material benefits for local communities, improving the credibility and verifiability of emissions reductions, and maintaining an open dialogue among stakeholders.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryS1", "reason": "The article discusses reforestation and afforestation as natural climate solutions that can cut carbon and restore ecosystems."}, "sentiment": {"score": 5, "reason": "The article discusses the positive impact of reforestation and afforestation as natural climate solutions to cut carbon emissions and restore ecosystems."}, "content": "\n\n\n\n[Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu)\n\n\n\n[MIT Top Menu\u2193](#tle-nav--menu)\n* [Education](http://web.mit.edu/education)\n* [Research](http://web.mit.edu/research)\n* [Innovation](http://web.mit.edu/innovation)\n* [Admissions + Aid](http://web.mit.edu/admissions-aid)\n* [Campus Life](http://web.mit.edu/campus-life)\n* [News](/)\n* [Alumni](http://web.mit.edu/alumni)\n* [About MIT](http://web.mit.edu/about)\n* More \u2193\n\n\n\n[Search MIT](http://web.mit.edu/search/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch websites, locations, and people\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More Results\n\n\n[Suggestions or feedback?](http://web.mit.edu/feedback)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology](/)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Subscribe to MIT News newsletter](http://web.mit.edu/mit-daily-weekly/)\n\n\n[Browse](#site-nav--browse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter keywords to search for news articles:\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse By\n---------\n\n\n\n\n\n ### Topics\n\n\n[View All](/topics) \u2192\n \nExplore:\n* [Machine learning](/topic/machine-learning)\n* [Social justice](/topic/social-justice)\n* [Startups](/topic/startups)\n* [Black holes](/topic/black-holes)\n* [Classes and programs](/topic/classes-and-programs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ### Departments\n\n\n[View All](/departments) \u2192\n \nExplore:\n* [Aeronautics and Astronautics](/department/aeronautics-and-astronautics)\n* [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](/department/brain-and-cognitive-sciences)\n* [Architecture](/department/architecture)\n* [Political Science](/department/political-science)\n* [Mechanical Engineering](/department/mechanical-engineering)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ### Centers, Labs, & Programs\n\n\n[View All](/centers-labs-programs) \u2192\n \nExplore:\n* [Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)](/clp/abdul-latif-jameel-poverty-action-lab-j-pal)\n* [Picower Institute for Learning and Memory](/clp/picower-institute)\n* [Media Lab](/clp/media-lab)\n* [Lincoln Laboratory](/clp/lincoln-laboratory)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ### Schools\n\n\n \n* [School of Architecture + Planning](/school/architecture-and-planning)\n* [School of Engineering](/school/engineering)\n* [School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences](/school/humanities-arts-and-social-sciences)\n* [Sloan School of Management](/school/management)\n* [School of Science](/school/science)\n* [MIT Schwarzman College of Computing](/school/mit-schwarzman-college-computing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[View all news coverage of MIT in the media](/in-the-media) \u2192\n\n\n[Listen to audio content from MIT News](/podcasts) \u2192\n\n\n[Subscribe to MIT newsletter](http://web.mit.edu/subscribe/) \u2192\n\n\n[Close](#)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Breadcrumb\n\n\n1.

According to the latest United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/), achieving that goal will require both large-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and removal of GHGs from the atmosphere.\n\n\nAt present, the most efficient and scalable GHG-removal strategy is the massive planting of trees through reforestation or afforestation \u2014 a \u201cnatural climate solution\u201d (NCS) that extracts atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and soil carbon sequestration.\n\n\nDespite the potential of forestry-based NCS projects to address climate change, biodiversity loss, unemployment, and other societal needs \u2014 and their appeal to policymakers, funders, and citizens \u2014 they have yet to achieve critical mass, and often underperform due to a mix of interacting ecological, social, and financial constraints. To better understand these challenges and identify opportunities to overcome them, a team of researchers at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and the [MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](https://globalchange.mit.edu/) recently studied how environmental scientists, local stakeholders, and project funders perceive the risks and benefits of NCS projects, and how these perceptions impact project goals and performance. To that end, they surveyed and consulted with dozens of recognized experts and organizations spanning the fields of ecology, finance, climate policy, and social science.\n\n\nThe team\u2019s [analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2023.1216175/full?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE), which appears in the journal *Frontiers in Climate,* found two main factors that have hindered the success of forestry-based NCS projects.\n\n\nFirst, the ambition \u2014 levels of carbon removal, ecosystem restoration, job creation, and other environmental and social targets \u2014 of selected NCS projects is limited by funders\u2019 perceptions of their overall risk. Among other things, funders aim to minimize operational risk (e.g., Will newly planted trees survive and grow?), political risk (e.g., Just how secure is their access to the land where trees will be planted?); and reputational risk (e.g., Will the project be perceived as an exercise in \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d or fall way short of its promised environmental and social benefits?). Funders seeking a financial return on their initial investment are also concerned about the dependability of complex monitoring, reporting, and verification methods used to quantify atmospheric carbon removal, biodiversity gains, and other metrics of project performance.\n\n\nSecond, the environmental and social benefits of NCS projects are unlikely to be realized unless the\u00a0local communities impacted by these projects are granted ownership over their implementation and outcomes. But while engaging with local communities is critical to project performance, it can be challenging both legally and financially to set up incentives (e.g., payment and other forms of compensation) to mobilize such engagement.\n\n\n\u201cMany carbon offset projects raise legitimate concerns about their effectiveness,\u201d says study lead author [Bonnie Waring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.waring), a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London. \u201cHowever, if nature climate solution projects are done properly, they can help with sustainable development and empower local communities.\u201d\n\n\nDrawing on surveys and consultations with NCS experts, stakeholders, and funders, the research team highlighted several recommendations on how to overcome key challenges faced by forestry-based NCS projects and boost their environmental and social performance.\n\n\nThese recommendations include encouraging funders to evaluate projects based on robust internal governance, support from regional and national governments, secure land tenure, material benefits for local communities, and full participation of community members from across a spectrum of socioeconomic groups; improving the credibility and verifiability of project emissions reductions and related co-benefits; and maintaining an open dialogue and shared costs and benefits among those who fund, implement, and benefit from these projects.\n\n\n\u201cAddressing climate change requires approaches that include emissions mitigation from economic activities paired with greenhouse gas reductions by natural ecosystems,\u201d says [Sergey Paltsev](https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey), a co-author of the study and deputy director of the MIT Joint Program. \u201cGuided by these recommendations, we advocate for a proper scaling-up of NCS activities from project levels to help assure integrity of emissions reductions across entire countries.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727)\n* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://news.mit.edu/2023/how-forests-can-cut-carbon-restore-ecosystems-create-jobs-0727&title=How%20forests%20can%20cut%20carbon%2C%20restore%20ecosystems%2C%20and%20create%20jobs)\n* [Print](#)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Paper: \"Natural climate solutions must embrace multiple perspectives to ensure synergy with sustainable development\"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2023.1216175/full?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Check for open access version(s) of the research mentioned in this article.](https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/publishing/find-oa-articles/ )\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n-------------\n\n\n\n* [Sergey Paltsev](https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey)\n* [Bonnie Waring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.waring)\n* [Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](https://globalchange.mit.edu/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n--------------\n\n\n* [Climate change](/topic/climate-change)\n* [Agriculture](/topic/agriculture)\n* [Labor and jobs](/topic/labor-jobs)\n* [Pollution](/topic/pollution)\n* [Global Warming](/topic/globalwarming)\n* [Policy](/topic/policy)\n* [Sustainability](/topic/sustainability)\n* [Environment](/topic/environment)\n* [Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](/topic/joint-program-science-and-policy-global-change-0)\n* [EAPS](/topic/eaps)\n* [MIT Energy Initiative](/topic/mit-energy-initiative)\n* [School of Science](/topic/school-science)\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n----------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Sean Anklam and Marcela Angel lead a larger group down a dirt road in a verdant, mountainous area of Colombia](/themes/mit/src/img/placeholder/placeholder--frontpage--featured-news.jpg)](/2023/preparing-colombia-cities-for-changing-forests-marcela-angel-0615)\n\n\n\n### \n[Preparing Colombia\u2019s cities for life amid changing forests](/2023/preparing-colombia-cities-for-changing-forests-marcela-angel-0615)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Aerial view of an abandoned agricultural terrace in France](/themes/mit/src/img/placeholder/placeholder--frontpage--featured-news.jpg)](/2023/3-questions-can-disused-croplands-help-mitigate-climate-change-0519)\n\n\n\n### \n[3 Questions: Can disused croplands help mitigate climate change?](/2023/3-questions-can-disused-croplands-help-mitigate-climate-change-0519)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Horizontal bar graph with six internet apps listed on the y axis and their estimated water, land, and carbon footprints measured on the x axis.

discussions at the International Seabed Authority (ISA). Such mining would pose substantial risks to marine life and ecosystems, as well as humans, which are not yet fully understood.\n\n\nIt stands to negatively impact many ocean dwellers, from small organisms who live on the seafloor to large marine mammals. Moreover, the ocean is the [world\u2019s biggest carbon sink](https://www.wri.org/insights/deep-sea-mining-explained#:~:text=The%20loss%20of%20deep%2Dsea,help%20mitigate%20global%20temperature%20rise.). As the World Resources Institute has pointed out, mining could impact its carbon cycle through the destruction of deep-sea biodiversity, with implications for global warming.\n\n\nFurther, if deep-sea mining does go ahead, it could cost the Earth \u2013 financially speaking \u2013 for companies involved too. This is because experts say risks should be quantified and passed on to mining companies via the cost of contracts if the ISA does its due diligence in the ongoing deliberations.\n\n\nISA continues its deliberations\n-------------------------------\n\n\nThe ISA is currently working out the regulatory framework for deep-sea mining. This is a highly controversial emerging sector that hopes to scour the seabed in international waters for minerals.\n\n\n\n\n##### Sign up to our FREE Daily News Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will not share your information with third parties.

This effectively binds the ISA to consider applications for deep-sea mining following that two-year window.\n\n\nNauru\u2019s triggering of the rule led to concerns that the Council had to finalise deep-sea mining regulations by the July meeting, otherwise the ISA may have to consider and approve mining without rules in place. As the Research Institute for Sustainability\u2019s [Pradeep Singh](https://www.rifs-potsdam.de/en/people/pradeep-singh) [forensically laid out in a paper](https://brill.com/view/journals/estu/37/3/article-p375_1.xml), however, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case. Singh told the *Canary*:\n\n\n\n> It has been agreed already that an application being submitted does not mean that it would have to be approved, it can be rejected. Approval is not guaranteed and it can be rejected as well.\n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, the Council [concluded](https://enb.iisd.org/international-seabed-authority-isa-council-28-2-21jul2023) its July meeting by committing to continue work on the regulations \u201cwith a view to their adoption\u201d in 2025.\n\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 senior manager of ocean governance, [Julian Jackson](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/experts/julian-jackson), provided further clarity on this. He said that the Council\u2019s plan provides for the regulations\u2019 adoption in 2025:\n\n\n\n> in the highly theoretical eventuality that they are ready \u2013 but the reality is that we are very, very far from completing any of the required elements.\n> \n> \n\n\nCost of deep-sea mining for companies\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nOne of the myriad things that the ISA needs to determine is how much mining contracts should cost companies. Singh highlighted that:\n\n\n\n> Up until recently, the models that were being considered were set so low. They essentially were taking the approach that since this is a nascent new activity, it\u2019s high risk and we need to entice investors to come and do deep seabed mining \u2013 and the way to entice them is to set the rates of payments so low that they are like \u2018OK, it\u2019s worth the risk\u2019.\n> \n> \n\n\nSingh described this as \u201cabsurd\u201d, arguing that the cost needs to be set \u201cmuch higher\u201d, at least to begin with. According to Singh, this is because:\n\n\n\n> there\u2019s so little evidence at this point in time to quantify the ecosystem services and what sort of benefits we have from not mining, that we need more time to study. But presumably those numbers are going to be high and exorbitant, and you need to factor that into the financial model when you determine how much contractors would have to pay and it needs to be significantly higher than the rates that they are talking about now.\n> \n> \n\n\nSome countries, like Germany and Costa Rica, are pushing in this direction, Singh said. He explained that they proposed in a meeting last November:\n\n\n\n> that we need to have a study on the environmental costs of deep sea bed mining and externalities \u2013 and how we internalise these externalities in the financial model\n> \n> \n\n\nDeep-sea mining risks high costs for ecosystems\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe ocean provides a whole host of ecosystem services, from [food to carbon storage](https://www.ocean-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ecosystem-services-deep-ocean_ScientificNotes_Oct2016_BD_ppp-9.pdf). As Singh indicated, the [environmental risks](https://www.thecanary.co/topics/environment) of mining are not yet comprehensively known. But some studies have pointed to its dangers.\n\n\nIn February, a paper by scientists from the University of Exeter and Greenpeace Research Laboratories [warned that mining could pose](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1095930/full) a \u201csignificant risk to ocean ecosystems\u201d. The paper focused on marine mammals, such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises. It spotlighted the impact of noise and disturbance from mining on them. The production and detection of sound is critical for the navigation and communication of marine mammals.\n\n\nA further paper showed that [fish fled an area subject to a small deep-sea mining test](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/deep-sea-mining-fish-shrimp-study) conducted by Japan. The area saw a 43% fall in fish and shrimp populations between a month and a year after the test. Another recent study pointed to mining posing a [significant risk to tuna](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44183-023-00016-8), particularly in light of their changing movements due to the climate crisis. This would [impact the $5.5bn tuna industry](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-11/deep-sea-mining-threatens-5-5-billion-tuna-industry-study-finds?leadSource=uverify%20wall). Unsurprisingly, groups representing companies with interests in this element of the wildlife trade are [among the critics of deep-sea mining](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/11/seafood-industry-joins-chorus-of-groups-calling-for-a-halt-to-deep-sea-mining-plans).\n\n\n\u2018The implications are severe\u2019\n-----------------------------\n\n\nProviding a stark example of the unknown risks, researchers also revealed in May that they [found over 5,000 species](https://oceanographicmagazine.com/news/5000-new-species-found-in-clarion-clipperton-zone/#:~:text=Over%205%2C000%20previously%20unknown%20species,start%20of%20deep%2Dsea%20mining.&text=A%20team%20of%20researchers%20has,Clipperton%20Zone%20in%20the%20Pacific.) in a potential mining hotspot. Most of these species were not known to science.\n\n\nAdditionally, Singh said that concerns are growing about:\n\n\n\n> the implications of light in that deep, to creatures that are totally exposed to the full darkness and what light could do to them.\n> \n> \n\n\nMoreover, he pointed out that the exploitation of mining companies\u2019 primary target \u2013 mineral-rich nodules \u2013 [poses a threat](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2021/oct/01/the-otherworldly-species-threatened-by-deep-sea-mining-in-pictures) to ocean [biodiversity](https://www.thecanary.co/topics/biodiversity-crisis). Singh said:\n\n\n\n> In the case of nodules, there\u2019s more and more evidence that there are organisms that are endemic to them, so they only live on on the hard substrate of the nodules. They would be wiped out.\n> \n> \n> So the implications are severe.\n> \n> \n\n\nAs *[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/fixing-deep-sea-mining-damage-would-be-double-cost-extraction-study-2023-06-29/)* reported, advocates of deep-sea mining say they could create clay nodules to replace habitats for endemic organisms, in the uncertain event these organisms could bounce back from the mortality that mining causes. But according to a report from Planet Tracker, the cost of replacing nodules would be double that of extraction. According to [Planet Tracker](https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Deep-Sea-Mining.pdf):\n\n\n\n> The cost of restoration would be so high it would be impossible for deep sea mining companies to pay for it and operate at a profit.\n> \n> \n\n\nContractors don\u2019t do science\n----------------------------\n\n\nMany scientists argue that much more marine scientific research is necessary to [understand the full environmental implications](https://seabedminingsciencestatement.org) of deep-sea mining. Singh stresses that this research is distinct from what some mining contractors are already doing in exploration contracts. The ISA has already granted [dozens of exploration contracts](https://savethehighseas.org/deep-sea-mining/the-main-players/), which Singh describes as contractors doing \u201ctheir groundwork in order to get an exploitation contract\u201d.\n\n\nThe ISA\u2019s secretariat is actively trying to conflate what the contractors are doing with marine scientific research, Singh warns. This conflation was evident in remarks by the general-secretary on 25 July, made during the Assembly meeting. Referring to the contractors\u2019 exploration, [Michael Lodge](https://enb.iisd.org/international-seabed-authority-isa-council-28-2-25jul2023) said:\n\n\n\n> rather than focus on doom and gloom scenarios, we should celebrate that today we know more on the ocean than any other time in human history.\n> \n> \n\n\nSingh is adamant, however, that exploration by contractors doesn\u2019t amount to marine scientific research. Only the latter, he says, can determine whether:\n\n\n\n> the science is telling us that this is not a good idea and we cannot go ahead with exploitation\n> \n> \n\n\nThe ISA secretariat, whose role is to implement the mandate of UNCLOS member states, has [faced accusations](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/worlds-seabed-regulator-accused-of-reckless-failings-over-deep-sea-mining) over recent years that it is [biased towards allowing mining](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/21/row-erupts-over-deep-sea-mining-as-world-races-to-finalise-vital-regulations) to take place.\n\n\nDeep-sea mining moratorium\n--------------------------\n\n\nIn a statement at the ISA Assembly meeting on 24 July, the Pew Trusts\u2019 Jackson highlighted the vast \u201cjob-of-work\u201d that the ISA still has to do. This includes attributing liability, recouping compensation, and working out a payment regime, i.e. determining how any income will be shared between countries. The ISA also has yet to create a viable inspection and compliance regime and fully develop vital standards and guidances \u2013 such as those pertaining to the environment. Figuring out the criteria for assessing and evaluating mining applications is still on the to-do list too.\n\n\nIn light of this, Jackson emphasised that time and space are needed and urged the Assembly to heed calls for a deep-sea mining moratorium.\n\n\nAs the [Deep Sea Mining Coalition](https://savethehighseas.org/voices-calling-for-a-moratorium-governments-and-parliamentarians/) has pointed out, 21 states so far have called for a precautionary pause or moratorium on any commercial exploitation. Meanwhile, many [indigenous leaders](https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-news/2023/03/21/we-do-not-consent-pacific-indigenous-leaders-reject-deep-sea-mining-plans/), [scientists](https://seabedminingsciencestatement.org), and [financial institutions](https://www.financeforbiodiversity.org/wp-content/uploads/Global-Financial-Institutions-Statement-to-Governments-on-Deep-Seabed-Mining_FfB-Foundation_19July2023.pdf) have spoken out against deep-sea mining too, variously calling for bans and pauses. As the Assembly meeting got underway, meanwhile, over 70 parliamentarians from 25 countries publicly [called on all countries to support a moratorium](https://news.mongabay.com/2023/07/scores-of-parliamentarians-renew-opposition-to-deep-sea-mining-at-international-meeting-commentary/).\n\n\nDo for the deep sea what we did for whales\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nMining proponents have questioned the legality of a moratorium due to UNCLOS providing for the exploration and exploitation of minerals, Singh highlighted. In response, the Pew Trusts commissioned an [independent legal opinion](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2023/06/seabed-mining-moratorium-is-legally-required-by-un-treaty-legal-experts-find) on the issue. It suggests that a moratorium is not only legal but required by international law. This is due to scientific uncertainty, lack of a regulatory framework, and the ISA\u2019s limited capacity for oversight and governance.\n\n\nSingh also points to an example, the [International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling](https://iwc.int/commission/convention). He says:\n\n\n\n> We have a treaty on whaling that says you can go out and exploit whales. And yet the same regime has imposed a moratorium for 40 years now.\n> \n> \n\n\nIn other words, countries could do for the deep sea what they did for the whales that live in the ocean: press pause. This would give them breathing space to comprehensively assess and quantify all the potential damages. That includes all the damage to ecosystems, industries, and planetary health, that mining risks.\n\n\nWhen the world understands the true cost of such extraction, it may determine it\u2019s too high a price to pay. That goes for the companies dead set on deep-sea mining too.\n\n\n*Featured image via [BBC Earth / YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkfTSlTnaBQ)*\n\n\n[Support us and go ad-free](https://www.thecanary.co/support/)\n"}], [{"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Carbon Trading Market to Reach US$ 4.8 trillion in 2031, Expanding at a CAGR of 19.0% Says, Transparency Market Research", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carbon-trading-market-reach-us-093000702.html", "summary": "- The global carbon trading market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 19.0% from 2023 to 2031, with a valuation of US$ 4.8 trillion anticipated in 2031.\n- Implementation of environmental regulations and policies that impose limits on greenhouse gas emissions is a significant driver for the carbon trading market.\n- Major players in the market include 3Degrees, Anew Climate, BP, C-Quest Capital, EKI Energy Services, Finite Carbon, Forest Carbon, GECA Environnement, Native Energy, Shell, South Pole, and Terrapass.\n- The introduction of a price on carbon emissions drives the carbon trading market, creating a financial incentive for companies to reduce emissions and invest in low-carbon technologies.\n- Growing investor interest in environmental sustainability and ESG criteria influences the carbon trading market.\n- North America and Asia Pacific are key regions in the carbon trading market, with various initiatives and carbon pricing mechanisms in place.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryN1", "reason": "The article provides information and trends about the global carbon trading market."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article highlights the positive impact of carbon trading in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting environmental sustainability."}, "content": "![Transparency Market Research](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FT2OkH.0O9ex.BrD8arUiA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQyMDtoPTE1NQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/ad6527004e835f57e01c069b25652830)Transparency Market Research*Increasing technological advances and creative solutions in different sectors such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage are expected to fuel the market demand during the forecast period.*\n\nWilmington, Delaware, United States, July 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Transparency Market Research Inc. -** The global carbon trading market is projected to flourish at a CAGR of 19.0% from 2023 to 2031.

In 2022, the market for carbon trading was valued at US$ 1.0 trillion  \n\n\nThe implementation of environmental regulations and policies that impose limits on greenhouse gas emissions is a significant driver for the carbon trading market. Governments and regulatory bodies set emission reduction targets, establish caps on emissions and enforce compliance through trading schemes. These policies create a demand for emission allowances and provide a regulatory framework for carbon trading.\n\n**Download sample PDF Copy at:** [**https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep\\_id=85673**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SWSlu8_JsHqiNN_4PcHXX4ag9_433bNhbmYB64GupeSryApKFUPlv9_r3KlBusunwamH3gvvptfL56LxGIBjxcG5-M4J9QKGJfNYTloPNAyzQpmiNuMMfAiHKC_XvR943G5q5d4r7ZMSAwzpMLuw2uFcUfXWVWOKypu3X88Rc6rj5uSXtlG6iRgPJp1ztNRYAQo0pIGgs08NiIg7Bbe5cwYRmlVC8rDkq63a15JySUW5I4UZvDizhsZfW08cg3hP)\n\n**Competitive Landscape**\n\nTransparency Market Research has profiled the following players in its global carbon trading market report:\n\n3Degrees, Anew Climate, LLC, BP P.L.C., C-Quest Capital LLC, EKI Energy Services Ltd. (EKI), Finite Carbon Corporation, Forest Carbon, GECA Environnement, Native Energy, Shell, South Pole, and Terrapass.\n\nThe market players in the carbon trading market are performing mergers, acquisitions, and collaborations to expand the business lines. Some of the developments in the carbon trading market are as follows-\n\n* In March 2023, Sweep, the leading carbon management and reduction platform announced a partnership with 3Degrees, a leader in global climate solutions. The two certified B Corporations will team up to provide a seamless experience for organizations looking to measure and take action on their operational and value chain emissions.\n* Shell and BP are major oil and gas companies that have been actively involved in the carbon trading market. They have invested in renewable energy projects, carbon capture, and storage initiatives, and have participated in carbon offset projects. These companies are aligning their strategies with the transition to a low-carbon economy and exploring opportunities in the evolving carbon trading landscape.\n\nStory continuesThe introduction of a price on carbon emissions, either through carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, drives the carbon trading market. A carbon price creates a financial incentive for companies to reduce their emissions and invest in low-carbon technologies. It encourages market participants to trade emission allowances to optimize costs and compliance.\n\nThe growing interest of investors in environmental sustainability and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria have influenced the carbon trading market. Investors increasingly consider a company's carbon footprint and emission reduction strategies when making investment decisions. This demand for ESG-aligned investments encourages companies to participate in carbon trading and demonstrate their commitment to sustainable practices, this is expected to boost the carbon trading market demand.\n\n**Key Takeaways from the Market Report**\n\n* As of 2023, the carbon trading market is forecast to reach US$ 1.19 trillion\n* Based on source, demand for chemicals is rising significantly\n* Cap & Trade segment to remain popular during the forecast period\n* Based on platform type, the compliance segment is expected to account for a significant market share during the forecast period.\n* By End-use, the energy segment is expected to generate high revenue during the forecast period.\n\n**Share Your Requirement and Get Customized Reports:**  [**https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=CR&rep\\_id=85673**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SWSlu8_JsHqiNN_4PcHXX4ag9_433bNhbmYB64GupeSryApKFUPlv9_r3KlBusunwamH3gvvptfL56LxGIBjxQadZ5j_plQaCG-FFBdfsZA4URqMnAKzJpXFHQVbDDU0FqFTMW9b8jfQFw3fUvaljjGhYy2t4obR-mCadk9pNO7oOfneMOCgmkg_ttzISU04DCEYTt7tC8BmhVySHNXjRgnh8Efbr4PTFGIqEHTqc8Om1sVrfOUxJng5z9CmJQ4F)\n\n**Carbon Trading Market: Prominent Drivers and Trends**\n\n* The extensive application of carbon trading in the energy sector is creating opportunities for market growth. Implementation of regulatory framework and policies in the energy sector to reduce the carbon emission\n* Voluntary carbon offsetting by individuals, organizations, and companies seeking to neutralize their emissions has contributed to the growth of the carbon trading market.\n* Government has also implemented emission reduction targets and set clear goals and provide a roadmap to align their strategies and participated in emission reduction activities.\n\n**Carbon Trading Market: Regional Analysis**\n\n* North America has witnessed various carbon trading initiatives such as WCI is a collaboration among several jurisdictions in North America. It includes California, Quebec (Canada), and several U.S. states. The WCI aims to establish a regional carbon market and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has been working towards the development of a joint cap-and-trade program that would allow for cross-border trading of emission allowances.\n* Asia Pacific accounts for a significant share of the carbon trading market as different countries and jurisdictions implement carbon pricing mechanisms. China has launched the China Emission Trading Scheme ETS. the world's largest carbon trading market which covers the power sector and is expected to expand to other industries to reduce emissions and promote low-carbon development. The China ETS has the potential to become a major driver of the carbon trading market in the region.\n\n**Source**\n\n* Forestry-related\n* Agri-related\n* Carbon Capture & Storage\n* Waste\n* Chemicals\n* Others\n\n**Platform Type**\n\n* Compliance\n* Voluntary\n\n**System Type**\n\n* Cap & Trade\n* Baseline & Credit\n\n**End-use**\n\n* Energy\n* Utility\n* Transportation\n* Industrial\n* Retail\n* Others\n\n**Region**\n\n* North America\n* Europe\n* Asia Pacific\n* Middle East & Africa\n* Latin America\n\n**Procure Complete Report (365** **Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures)** [**https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/checkout.php?rep\\_id=85673&ltype=S**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SWSlu8_JsHqiNN_4PcHXX4ag9_433bNhbmYB64GupeSryApKFUPlv9_r3KlBusun6cxYL72yt61_y3LPGjDEgyTSuS1pAeOLmHaWsi62XFWyLGAtNfkbtAkh19V13MIAGlaZknxisjhicNb7Zq5Ws4_UzzErAydyTC_Yg1MoCwiVcAlRlNF8kTTzbTb_QCC56tjtg1eETdTy8cWgFmvZ0IFEBjqzLeI7t4f6yVfbMESOh14vNZvdkSrg5zxY-IHp)\n\n**About Transparency Market Research**\n\nTransparency Market Research, a global market research company registered at Wilmington, Delaware, United States, provides custom research and consulting services.

Putting a price on carbon emissions by developing a trading system (carbon market) to buy and sell carbon credits is one way to limit emissions. The Ministry of Power\u2019s (MoP) recent [Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023](https://powerline.net.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CCTS.pdf) aims at creating a domestic market for tracking and trading carbon credits. The policy is a step in the right direction for setting up India's compliance and voluntary carbon markets. Still, several questions remain unanswered on whether it operationalises the market. \u00a0\n\n\nThe concept of carbon credit is not new in India. The domestic carbon compliance market has existed for a long time in the form of Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) for tradable energy certificates (ESCerts) by designated consumers in industrial units from energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium, cement, chlor-alkali, fertiliser, iron & steel, paper & pulp, railways, thermal power and textile. The Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for renewable energy certificates (RECs) by generators producing electricity from clean sources like solar, wind, biomass, small hydro and municipal solid waste is another form of carbon compliance. Further, the Energy Conservation Act\u00a02001 also discusses issuing carbon credit certificates to registered entities.\n\n\nCCTS will now encompass the existing trading mechanism by transitioning from tonnes of oil equivalent (ESCerts) to carbon certificates expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. \n\n\nThe CCTS notification lays the framework and structure of the domestic carbon market. It constitutes a National Steering Committee comprising representatives from key ministries to govern the domestic carbon market. This committee will give recommendations to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for establishing emissions targets and trajectories for obligated entities under the compliance mechanism and lay guidelines for issuing and trading carbon credit certificates outside India.\n\n\nEssentially, BEE will become an administrator and develop procedures and eligibility criteria for accrediting carbon verification agencies. The Grid Controller of India will handle the meta registry for obligated and non-obligated entities under the compliance and voluntary carbon markets, respectively. Meanwhile, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will regulate the trading of certificates.\n\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) provided [a series of comments](https://ieefa.org/resources/comments-ministry-power-draft-carbon-credit-trading-scheme-ccts) in response to the draft CCTS released by the MoP in March 2023. The MoP adopted some of the suggestions, including setting up a meta registry that will be compatible with international registries, the inclusion of the non-power sector, a pathway for setting targets for emission reduction and inclusion of PAT and REC. But, the notification falls short of clarifying the operationalisation aspects, including eligible consumers, price discovery, voluntary market mechanisms and linking the domestic carbon market with the international markets to attract finance and technology.\n\n\n**Timeline for operationalising the market**\n\n\nThe notification does not provide a timeline for operationalising the carbon market, including which section of the market is likely to start first. It defines obligated entities as those notified under the compliance mechanismand non-obligated entities as those that can purchase carbon credit certificates voluntarily. This definition and stakeholder consultations held by the BEE suggest that obligated entities are those that the existing PAT scheme covers. The current cycle for [PAT](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1811051) continues until 2025. It is unclear whether the CCTS mandates all or some of these entities to transfer to the carbon credit market. As such, it will be useful to understand the timeline. Some [newspaper reports](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/voluntary-carbon-trades-to-start-in-2023-11674498997601.html) discuss starting the voluntary carbon market right away. This requires clarity on the sectors and a timeline for targets and processes.\n\n\n**Limited specification on the sectors eligible to participate in the domestic carbon market**\n\n\nThe notification states that the MoP will notify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity targets to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), based on recommendations from BEE. Obligated entities will have to achieve these targets along with any other targets, such as non-fossil energy consumption or specific energy consumption, as per the MoP\u2019s notifications. But there is no clarity on the eligibility of the sectors and industries under this scheme. The eleven sectors identified by the [National Carbon Market](https://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/publications/files/NCM%20Final.pdf) include petroleum refineries, cement, steel, chlor-alkali, aluminium, thermal power plants and fertilisers. Will the list expand to add more sectors? If yes, then the question is how will these additional sectors be identified. \n\n\n**Aligning with the existing domestic market**\n\n\nThe [Green Credit Programme\u00a0(GCP)](https://moef.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Draft-GCP-Notification-Inviting-Comments-27062023.pdf) announced by MoEFCC aims to incentivise environmentally conscious practises via trading green credits. This will be a purely voluntary market covering eight sectors, primarily affecting rural areas. The sectors focus on increasing tree cover, promoting water conservation, adopting natural and regenerative agricultural practices, improving soil health and the nutritional value of food, managing waste effectively and reducing air pollution. \n\n\nThese activities under GCP may generate green credits and carbon credits from the same activity under the carbon market. If this is so, how are the two different? What would be the potential use of green credits if they also generate carbon credits that could be sold in the domestic market? How will the two markets intersect or overlap?\n\n\n**Linkages with international carbon markets**\n\n\nIndia has been participating in the sale of carbon credits through the [Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)](https://www.india.gov.in/national-clean-development-mechanism-cdm-authority) route and private sector-driven voluntary carbon market. Between 2010 and 2022, India issued 278 million credits in the voluntary carbon market, accounting for 17% of global supply, according to the [Greenhouse Gas Emissions Special report](///Users/debabratadas/Downloads/Between%202010%20to%202022%20India%20issued%20278%20million%20credits%20in%20the%20Voluntary%20Carbon%20Market,%20accounting%20for%2017%25%20of%20global%20supply,%20according%20to%20a%20Jan.%2031%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20Special%20report%20by%20S&P%20Global%20Commodity%20Insights.) by S&P Global Commodity Insights. With the domestic carbon market now in place, it is unclear whether the global carbon credit certificates will run parallel to the domestic ones. \n\n\nIn addition, is there a need to regulate (if yes, how?) carbon credits exported for trade in the international voluntary carbon market? Such decisions will impact India\u2019s strategy to welcome foreign direct investment in decarbonisation activities.\n\n\n**Getting the pricing right for carbon credits**\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the carbon market will depend on the accuracy of carbon price discovery. If the buying price is too high, it will deter participation, especially from micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). If the selling price is too low, there will be no incentive for real emissions reduction.\n\n\nHence, a robust methodology for price discovery and some pilots will be necessary going forward. The methodology should clearly lay out the process for price discovery based on sectoral or unit-wise emission targets. It also needs structured checks and balances to ensure market stability and prevent an oversupply or overdemand of credits.\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon market requires even greater efforts as price discovery is more complex considering the variety in project sizes, location, quality, value adds, and more. The scheme seems to focus on the compliance market, providing limited guidance for non-obligated entities. Enhancing private sector participation in the voluntary carbon market needs a more structured and incentive-driven mechanism.\n\n\n**Learnings from the global voluntary carbon market**\n\n\nUnlike compliance markets, voluntary markets are usually partially regulated and market-driven. Hence, multiple agencies with their own standards, eligibility criteria and terminologies exist. [Offset standards](https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/protocols-standards/), including Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard, verify the projects and ensure they follow strict rules and maintain high environmental integrity standards. However, these standards usually only assess the original offsetting project and not the broader ecosystem, allowing companies to prioritise whatever makes the most financial sense.\n\n\nAs India sets the foundation for its domestic carbon market, it is crucial to understand the governance structure for voluntary carbon markets. Will the National Steering Committee decide the standards, or will they remain open for the industries to take a call on? Would there be interoperability between voluntary carbon credits bought or sold in the international carbon market and the domestic voluntary market?\n\n\nIEEFA welcomes the efforts taken by MoP to develop the Indian carbon market. Still, operationalising the market requires more efforts on consumer profiling, target setting, cross-ministerial coordination and robust monitoring and verification. The carbon market would help corporations become carbon neutral. In addition to the compliance market, clarity on the timeline and structure of the voluntary market is crucial considering the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) have already announced plans to explore voluntary carbon market.\n\n\n*This article was first published in [Business Today](https://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/columns/story/heres-why-crucial-aspects-of-indias-carbon-market-need-clarity-391502-2023-07-27).*\n\n"}], [{"source": "Arab News", "title": "Voluntary carbon markets evolving at a fast rate, says Saudi Aramco official", "link": "https://www.arabnews.com/node/2338716/business-economy", "summary": "- Error code 1020 occurred when visiting www.arabnews.com/node/2338716/business-economy\n- Ray ID for the error is 7edf929c7b941c50\n- The country is NZ (New Zealand)\n- The data center is akl01\n- The IP address is 2406:5a00:d88f:2200:d83f:60ac:ba53:3723\n- Timestamp for the error is 2023-07-28 19:36:44 UTC", "classification": {"category": "CategoryO1", "reason": "The article is not related to carbon."}, "sentiment": {"score": 1, "reason": "The article does not provide any sentiment or information related to carbon removal or prevention of carbon emissions."}, "content": "I got an error when visiting www.arabnews.com/node/2338716/business-economy.\n\n\nError code: 1020\n\n\nRay ID: 7edf929c7b941c50\n\n\nCountry: NZ\n\n\nData center: akl01\n\n\nIP: 2406:5a00:d88f:2200:d83f:60ac:ba53:3723\n\n\nTimestamp: 2023-07-28 19:36:44 UTC\n\n\n"}, {"source": "IEEFA", "title": "Crucial contours for operationalising the Indian carbon market need clarity", "link": "https://ieefa.org/resources/crucial-contours-operationalising-indian-carbon-market-need-clarity", "summary": "- The Ministry of Power in India has introduced a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) to create a domestic market for tracking and trading carbon credits.\n- The CCTS transitions from tradable energy certificates (ESCerts) to carbon certificates expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent.\n- The CCTS notification establishes a National Steering Committee to govern the domestic carbon market and lays out the roles of various entities involved.\n- However, there are still unanswered questions about the operationalization of the market, such as eligible consumers, price discovery, and linking with international markets.\n- The timeline for operationalizing the market is not provided, and it is unclear which section of the market will start first.\n- There is limited specification on the sectors eligible to participate in the domestic carbon market, and it is unclear how additional sectors will be identified.\n- The Green Credit Programme (GCP) announced by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change overlaps with the carbon market, raising questions about how the two will interact.\n- It is unclear whether global carbon credit certificates will run parallel to domestic ones, and there may be a need to regulate carbon credits exported for trade in the international voluntary carbon market.\n- The effectiveness of the carbon market depends on accurate carbon price discovery, and the methodology for price discovery needs to be robust and balanced.\n- Multiple agencies and offset standards exist in the global voluntary carbon market, and it is important to understand the governance structure for voluntary carbon markets in India.\n- Operationalizing the market requires more efforts on consumer profiling, target setting, coordination, and monitoring and verification.\n- Clarity on the timeline and structure of the voluntary market is crucial, as the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) are already exploring voluntary carbon market plans.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryS1", "reason": "The article discusses the Ministry of Power's Carbon Credit Trading Scheme and the establishment of a domestic carbon market."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses the introduction of a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme and the efforts to create a domestic carbon market, which are seen as positive steps in combating climate change and reducing carbon emissions."}, "content": "Economies globally have recognised the urgency of limiting carbon emissions to fight climate change.

Others pull carbon out of the air, but only temporarily, or are susceptible to \u201cdouble-counting,\u201d in which the same credits are claimed by two separate organizations. Experts have described offsets as a \u201c[climate scam](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/17/carbon-offsets-flights-airlines/)\u201d and the voluntary market for them a \u201c[Wild West](https://www.ft.com/content/9b02fcf7-9e04-4b71-ad14-251552d5a78e).\u201d\n\n\nOffsets are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters and then sold to firms and organizations via brokers.\nNow, federal regulatory agencies are beginning to take note. One of these is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, an independent government body charged with ensuring the stability of the country\u2019s derivatives markets. This week, the commission held its\u00a0[second roundtable discussion](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8731-23)\u00a0on promoting \u201cintegrity for high quality carbon credit derivatives,\u201d and other recent actions suggest that it\u2019s gearing up for a more proactive regulatory role in this space.\u00a0\n\n\nLast month, for example, the CFTC released a\u00a0[whistleblower alert](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8723-23) asking the public for tips about fraud and manipulation in voluntary carbon markets\u2014a \u201cprecursor\u201d to bringing enforcement actions against market manipulators, according to Todd Phillips, a fellow at the think tank the Roosevelt Institute. Just a few days later, the CFTC announced a new [Environmental Fraud Task Force](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8736-23)\u00a0within its enforcement division, to help investigate cases of \u201cfraud and misconduct\u201d in offset-related markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe CFTC is uniquely situated to address this issue,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThere really is no one else.\u201d\n\n\nExactly how they\u2019ll do it, however, is uncertain.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, created by Congress in 1974, regulates the US markets for derivatives, contracts between parties in which prices are derived from the value of an underlying asset or benchmark. Such contracts can help hedge against risk; a futures contract, for example, guarantees the price for which a given asset will be sold at some point in the future. Farmers often use these kinds of contracts to guarantee their crops will sell for an agreed-upon price at the end of the harvest, protecting them from a downward swing in the market. Meanwhile, the CFTC\u2019s job is to ensure that the crops actually get delivered, as per the contract.\u00a0\n\n\n![Rostin Behnam, a bald man with light brown skin, speaking from a table](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rostin-Behnam-copy.jpg?w=642)![Rostin Behnam, a bald man with light brown skin, speaking from a table](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rostin-Behnam-copy.jpg?w=642)\nRostin Behnam, chair of the CFTC.\n\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty/Grist\n\n\nThis is all relatively straightforward when it comes to derivatives involving tangible commodities like wheat, which the CFTC has long regulated. But it\u2019s more complicated when it comes to carbon offsets. Offset credits are usually approved by unregulated standard-setters, sold to brokers, and then\u00a0[purchased by a company or organization](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/voluntary-carbon-markets-ecosystem-explained) to count toward their decarbonization pledges\u2014often via a futures contract, if the emissions offset has yet to happen and is promised to occur at some point in the future.\n\n\nCompared to wheat, it\u2019s much less obvious what counts as the legitimate delivery of a carbon credit. Many market participants are concerned that if the underlying commodity\u2014the offset\u2014is based on fraudulent assumptions and does not actually cancel out climate pollution, then derivatives based on those commodities are also fraudulent.\n\n\nThis is already a huge problem; experts have noted \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits. Buyers are motivated by low prices, for instance, and unregulated standard-setters run carbon credit registries that charge fees based on the volume of credits bought and sold, incentivizing them to set looser standards to enable more sales. Already, [millions of rainforest-related credits](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) approved by Verra, the world\u2019s largest standard-setter for the voluntary carbon markets, have been shown to be \u201c[nonadditional](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe),\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t yield additional emission reductions on top of what would have been expected if the credits didn\u2019t exist.\n\n\nExperts cite \u201cwidespread perverse incentives\u201d among market participants to inflate the climate benefits of their carbon credits.\nRobin Rix, Verra\u2019s chief legal, policy, and markets officer, acknowledged at the CFTC roundtable on Wednesday that voluntary carbon markets have characteristics that make them \u201cvulnerable to abuse by malicious actors.\u201d But he said it\u2019s a \u201cmisconception\u201d that voluntary carbon markets lack transparency and said his organization would support \u201ca more muscular approach to fraud and market manipulation\u201d from the CFTC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nVerra controls two-thirds of the world\u2019s voluntary carbon markets. The rest are largely dominated by just three other private registries: the Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, and the American Carbon Registry.\n\n\nThe CFTC has so far not waded into this morass, although many experts, advocacy groups, and even private businesses would like it to. Following the commission\u2019s first public convening on voluntary carbon markets last year, dozens of organizations responded to a\u00a0[request for information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/08/2022-12302/request-for-information-on-climate-related-financial-risk)\u00a0by saying that the CFTC should develop standards for carbon offsets that \u201c[effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can serve as underlying commodities for approved derivatives](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CFTC-Carbon-Offsets-Sign-On-Letter-final.pdf).\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nFreya Chay, program lead for the climate data nonprofit CarbonPlan, said such standards should require voluntary carbon markets to clearly distinguish between offsets that\u00a0*prevent*carbon emissions\u2014like if a project developer builds a wind farm rather than a coal plant\u2014and those that *remove* carbon from the atmosphere. She also called for greater transparency around the \u201cpermanence\u201d of removal-based offsets, i.e., how long they will keep carbon locked up. CO2 lasts around 1,000 years in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon credits derived from offset projects like tree-planting\u2014which might only keep carbon sequestered for a dozen years, since forests are susceptible to wildfires and illegal logging\u2014are often treated the same as those derived from geological sequestration, in which carbon is injected into rock formations and is more likely to stay put.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether a definition of what constitutes a high-quality carbon offset will come from the CFTC. Many speakers at Wednesday\u2019s roundtable said that, in order to allow the voluntary carbon markets to \u201creach their full potential,\u201d the commission should leave definitional work to the private sector, perhaps in the hands of an independent body called the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets. One speaker, representing an advocacy group for forest owners, called for the CFTC to only regulate with \u201ca light touch\u201d that allows standard-setters like Verra to continue to \u201cinnovate.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPhillips, with the Roosevelt Institute, said the CFTC should simply hold standard-setters responsible for the claims they make. During the roundtable, he emphasized three words: \u201cenforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201d\n\n\nGroups like Verra or the American Carbon Registry \u201chave standards that say if you meet these standards, your offsets will count as one ton of carbon emissions reduced,\u201d Phillips said in an interview with Grist. \u201cIf they make these assertions while knowing that they\u2019re not true, that\u2019s fraud.\u201d In such a case, the CFTC could impose\u00a0[civil monetary penalties](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/Enforcement/OfficeofDirectorEnforcement.html), freeze assets, or restrict an organization\u2019s trading privileges. The commission could also refer the case to the Justice Department for prosecution.\n\n\nAs carbon markets grow, it\u2019s likely that the CFTC\u2019s efforts will complement or even overlap with work from other federal agencies to prevent offsets-related greenwashing. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example\u2014an independent regulatory agency in charge of protecting investors\u2014has proposed rules that would require companies to disclose \u201c[certain information](https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf)\u201d about offsets they use, although it\u2019s not yet clear what kind of information this would include.\n\n\nSome experts say another agency, the Federal Trade Commission\u2014tasked with enforcing the United States\u2019 consumer protection laws\u2014could step in by including a more concrete (albeit nonbinding) definition of a high-quality carbon offset in its soon-to-be-updated guidelines for environmental marketing claims.\n\n\nPhillips, however, is pinning his hopes on the CFTC, which he said has shown the most interest in bringing enforcement actions. Indeed, commissioners on Wednesday spoke forcefully about the need to clean up the voluntary carbon markets.\n\n\n\u201cThe rapid growth of these markets requires the commission\u2019s careful attention,\u201d Commissioner Kristin Johnson told attendees. \u201cOur common goal must be to adopt a transparent path that effectively prevents double-counting, ensures additionality, and prevents fraud.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe CFTC has issued\u00a0[another request for information](https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7413)\u00a0from the public and is accepting submissions until August 18.\n\n\n\n\n[![More Mother Jones reporting on Climate Desk](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/themes/motherjones/img/topic-banners/climate-desk-642-60.png)](/topics/climate-desk)\n\n\n### \n\n\n\n Looking for news you can trust?\n\n\n*Subscribe to the* Mother Jones Daily *to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Close](#sailthru-signup-widget)\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n\n\nE32CB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our [privacy policy](https://www.motherjones.com/about/privacy-policy/) and [terms of use](https://www.motherjones.com/about/terms/), and to receive messages from *Mother Jones* and our partners.\n\n\n\n\n### AN IMPORTANT UPDATE ON MOTHER JONES' FINANCES\n\nWe need to start being more upfront about how hard it is keeping a newsroom like *Mother Jones* afloat these days.\n\n\nBecause it is, and because we're fresh off finishing a fiscal year, on June 30, that came up a bit short of where we needed to be.

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo\n\n\n\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -A global initiative to grow the $2 billion market for carbon offsets outlined criteria for new voluntary standards on Thursday, and said it aims to issue labelled credits by the year-end to make the unregulated marketplace more transparent.\n\n\nDemand for carbon offsets \u2013 credits for emissions-reducing activity that can be generated through projects such as tree planting \u2013 is expected to increase as companies with net-zero goals buy them to cancel out emissions elsewhere.\n\n\nBut the market is unregulated, with many different standards and approaches making it difficult for companies to assess which credits they should use.\n\n\nCritics of the market cite concerns including a lack of transparency and question the environmental quality of projects.\n\n\nThe Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), an independent governance body, has published its criteria for projects to achieve its new Core Carbon Principle (CCP) standards.\n\n\nThe criteria \u201cset a global threshold for quality which aims to unlock finance at speed and scale for projects to reduce and remove billions of tonnes of emissions that would not otherwise be viable,\u201d Integrity Council Chair Annette Nazareth said in a statement.\n\n\nUntil now, the most widely traded offsets abide by criteria established under the CORSIA scheme for the global airline industry.\n\n\nCCP approval will require many of the same features as CORSIA, such as a project having quantified monitoring, reporting and verification standards, or being unable to go ahead without the revenue from the sale of carbon credits.\n\n\nHowever, CCP credits will require additional measures, such as further governance checks. That could mean not all CORSIA credits will gain CCP status.\n\n\n\u201cWe do expect this will have a significant impact on the market, but we can\u2019t prejudge the pre-designed assessment process we are about to start,\u201d ICVCM COO William McDonnell said in an interview.\n\n\nTechnology to capture and store carbon emissions at projects that also involve oil recovery will be excluded from the CCPs, as will any projects involving coal-fired power generation.\n\n\nThere could be instances where projects developing new gas plants could generate credits if they are for a major renewables installation and a back-up gas plant is included as part of the scheme.\n\n\nThe project would need to meet other requirements and result in clear emission reductions, ICVCM said.\n\n\nIt is not yet mandatory for a company retiring a carbon credit to disclose their name, but new standards would require their registration.\n\n\nOnce a credit has been retired it cannot be traded or used to meet climate targets by another company.\n\n\nIndustry groups welcomed the launch of the CCPs but said more needed to be done to build trust.\n\n\n\u201cThe CCPs alone are not a silver bullet that can solve the challenge of carbon credit quality,\u201d Sebastien Cross, co-founder of carbon ratings company BeZero Carbon, said.\n\n\n\u201cUltimately some projects will still be more effective than others \u2013 a spectrum of quality will always exist,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/facebook-ic-1.png)\n![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/twitter-ic-1.png)\n![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/google-ic-1.png)\n![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/linkedin-ic.png)\n![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/email-ic.png)\n\n\n\n\n### \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### More Stories\n\n\n\n* [French interior minister says he understands police \u2018fatigue\u2019 but urges officers to serve public interest](https://www.fijitimes.com/french-interior-minister-says-he-understands-police-fatigue-but-urges-officers-to-serve-public-interest/)* [Kuruleca confirmed as PS Education; Minister respects PM\u2019s decision](https://www.fijitimes.com/kuruleca-confirmed-as-ps-education-minister-respects-pms-decision/)* [Mexican president defends armed forces in missing students case](https://www.fijitimes.com/mexican-president-defends-armed-forces-in-missing-students-case/)* [What\u2019s happening today!](https://www.fijitimes.com/whats-happening-today-824/)* [Niger coup could complicate UN peacekeepers withdrawal from Mali](https://www.fijitimes.com/niger-coup-could-complicate-un-peacekeepers-withdrawal-from-mali/)\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/themes/fijitimes/assets/fiji-stopped.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/themes/fijitimes/assets/fijinewspaper_delivery.png)](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/themes/fijitimes/assets/ft_senior_sig.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/themes/fijitimes/assets/calculator-btn.jpg)\n\n\n\n\r\n Amount of FJD:\r\n \n\n\r\n Convert To:\r\n \nUSD United States DollarAUD Australian DollarNZD New Zealand DollarCNY Chinese YuanEUR Euro GBP Pound SterlingJPY Japanese YenSGD Singapore DollarHKD Hong Kong DollarCAD Canadian DollarDKK Denmark KronerINR Indian RupeeNOK Norway KronerPKR Pakistan RupeePHP Philippine PesosZAR South Africa RandLKR Sri Lanka RupeeSEK Sweden KronerCHF Switzerland FrancsXPF French Pacific FrancsPGK Papua New Guinea KinaWST Samoa TalaSBD Solomon Island DollarTOP Tonga Pa'angaVUV Vanuatu Vatu \n\n\n\n\r\n Receive:\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n![](https://www.fijitimes.com/wp-content/themes/fijitimes/assets/fiji-stopped.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n\n\n1.

Putting a price on carbon emissions by developing a trading system (carbon market) to buy and sell carbon credits is one way to limit emissions. The Ministry of Power\u2019s (MoP) recent [Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023](https://powerline.net.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CCTS.pdf) aims at creating a domestic market for tracking and trading carbon credits. The policy is a step in the right direction for setting up India's compliance and voluntary carbon markets. Still, several questions remain unanswered on whether it operationalises the market. \u00a0\n\n\nThe concept of carbon credit is not new in India. The domestic carbon compliance market has existed for a long time in the form of Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) for tradable energy certificates (ESCerts) by designated consumers in industrial units from energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium, cement, chlor-alkali, fertiliser, iron & steel, paper & pulp, railways, thermal power and textile. The Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for renewable energy certificates (RECs) by generators producing electricity from clean sources like solar, wind, biomass, small hydro and municipal solid waste is another form of carbon compliance. Further, the Energy Conservation Act\u00a02001 also discusses issuing carbon credit certificates to registered entities.\n\n\nCCTS will now encompass the existing trading mechanism by transitioning from tonnes of oil equivalent (ESCerts) to carbon certificates expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. \n\n\nThe CCTS notification lays the framework and structure of the domestic carbon market. It constitutes a National Steering Committee comprising representatives from key ministries to govern the domestic carbon market. This committee will give recommendations to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for establishing emissions targets and trajectories for obligated entities under the compliance mechanism and lay guidelines for issuing and trading carbon credit certificates outside India.\n\n\nEssentially, BEE will become an administrator and develop procedures and eligibility criteria for accrediting carbon verification agencies. The Grid Controller of India will handle the meta registry for obligated and non-obligated entities under the compliance and voluntary carbon markets, respectively. Meanwhile, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will regulate the trading of certificates.\n\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) provided [a series of comments](https://ieefa.org/resources/comments-ministry-power-draft-carbon-credit-trading-scheme-ccts) in response to the draft CCTS released by the MoP in March 2023. The MoP adopted some of the suggestions, including setting up a meta registry that will be compatible with international registries, the inclusion of the non-power sector, a pathway for setting targets for emission reduction and inclusion of PAT and REC. But, the notification falls short of clarifying the operationalisation aspects, including eligible consumers, price discovery, voluntary market mechanisms and linking the domestic carbon market with the international markets to attract finance and technology.\n\n\n**Timeline for operationalising the market**\n\n\nThe notification does not provide a timeline for operationalising the carbon market, including which section of the market is likely to start first. It defines obligated entities as those notified under the compliance mechanismand non-obligated entities as those that can purchase carbon credit certificates voluntarily. This definition and stakeholder consultations held by the BEE suggest that obligated entities are those that the existing PAT scheme covers. The current cycle for [PAT](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1811051) continues until 2025. It is unclear whether the CCTS mandates all or some of these entities to transfer to the carbon credit market. As such, it will be useful to understand the timeline. Some [newspaper reports](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/voluntary-carbon-trades-to-start-in-2023-11674498997601.html) discuss starting the voluntary carbon market right away. This requires clarity on the sectors and a timeline for targets and processes.\n\n\n**Limited specification on the sectors eligible to participate in the domestic carbon market**\n\n\nThe notification states that the MoP will notify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity targets to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), based on recommendations from BEE. Obligated entities will have to achieve these targets along with any other targets, such as non-fossil energy consumption or specific energy consumption, as per the MoP\u2019s notifications. But there is no clarity on the eligibility of the sectors and industries under this scheme. The eleven sectors identified by the [National Carbon Market](https://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/publications/files/NCM%20Final.pdf) include petroleum refineries, cement, steel, chlor-alkali, aluminium, thermal power plants and fertilisers. Will the list expand to add more sectors? If yes, then the question is how will these additional sectors be identified. \n\n\n**Aligning with the existing domestic market**\n\n\nThe [Green Credit Programme\u00a0(GCP)](https://moef.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Draft-GCP-Notification-Inviting-Comments-27062023.pdf) announced by MoEFCC aims to incentivise environmentally conscious practises via trading green credits. This will be a purely voluntary market covering eight sectors, primarily affecting rural areas. The sectors focus on increasing tree cover, promoting water conservation, adopting natural and regenerative agricultural practices, improving soil health and the nutritional value of food, managing waste effectively and reducing air pollution. \n\n\nThese activities under GCP may generate green credits and carbon credits from the same activity under the carbon market. If this is so, how are the two different? What would be the potential use of green credits if they also generate carbon credits that could be sold in the domestic market? How will the two markets intersect or overlap?\n\n\n**Linkages with international carbon markets**\n\n\nIndia has been participating in the sale of carbon credits through the [Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)](https://www.india.gov.in/national-clean-development-mechanism-cdm-authority) route and private sector-driven voluntary carbon market. Between 2010 and 2022, India issued 278 million credits in the voluntary carbon market, accounting for 17% of global supply, according to the [Greenhouse Gas Emissions Special report](///Users/debabratadas/Downloads/Between%202010%20to%202022%20India%20issued%20278%20million%20credits%20in%20the%20Voluntary%20Carbon%20Market,%20accounting%20for%2017%25%20of%20global%20supply,%20according%20to%20a%20Jan.%2031%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20Special%20report%20by%20S&P%20Global%20Commodity%20Insights.) by S&P Global Commodity Insights. With the domestic carbon market now in place, it is unclear whether the global carbon credit certificates will run parallel to the domestic ones. \n\n\nIn addition, is there a need to regulate (if yes, how?) carbon credits exported for trade in the international voluntary carbon market? Such decisions will impact India\u2019s strategy to welcome foreign direct investment in decarbonisation activities.\n\n\n**Getting the pricing right for carbon credits**\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the carbon market will depend on the accuracy of carbon price discovery. If the buying price is too high, it will deter participation, especially from micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). If the selling price is too low, there will be no incentive for real emissions reduction.\n\n\nHence, a robust methodology for price discovery and some pilots will be necessary going forward. The methodology should clearly lay out the process for price discovery based on sectoral or unit-wise emission targets. It also needs structured checks and balances to ensure market stability and prevent an oversupply or overdemand of credits.\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon market requires even greater efforts as price discovery is more complex considering the variety in project sizes, location, quality, value adds, and more. The scheme seems to focus on the compliance market, providing limited guidance for non-obligated entities. Enhancing private sector participation in the voluntary carbon market needs a more structured and incentive-driven mechanism.\n\n\n**Learnings from the global voluntary carbon market**\n\n\nUnlike compliance markets, voluntary markets are usually partially regulated and market-driven. Hence, multiple agencies with their own standards, eligibility criteria and terminologies exist. [Offset standards](https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/protocols-standards/), including Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard, verify the projects and ensure they follow strict rules and maintain high environmental integrity standards. However, these standards usually only assess the original offsetting project and not the broader ecosystem, allowing companies to prioritise whatever makes the most financial sense.\n\n\nAs India sets the foundation for its domestic carbon market, it is crucial to understand the governance structure for voluntary carbon markets. Will the National Steering Committee decide the standards, or will they remain open for the industries to take a call on? Would there be interoperability between voluntary carbon credits bought or sold in the international carbon market and the domestic voluntary market?\n\n\nIEEFA welcomes the efforts taken by MoP to develop the Indian carbon market. Still, operationalising the market requires more efforts on consumer profiling, target setting, cross-ministerial coordination and robust monitoring and verification. The carbon market would help corporations become carbon neutral. In addition to the compliance market, clarity on the timeline and structure of the voluntary market is crucial considering the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) have already announced plans to explore voluntary carbon market.\n\n\n*This article was first published in [Business Today](https://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/columns/story/heres-why-crucial-aspects-of-indias-carbon-market-need-clarity-391502-2023-07-27).*\n\n"}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Carbon Trading Market to Reach US$ 4.8 trillion in 2031, Expanding at a CAGR of 19.0% Says, Transparency Market Research", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carbon-trading-market-reach-us-093000702.html", "summary": "- The global carbon trading market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 19.0% from 2023 to 2031, reaching a valuation of $4.8 trillion in 2031.\n- Environmental regulations and policies that limit greenhouse gas emissions are driving the carbon trading market.\n- Key players in the market include 3Degrees, BP, Shell, and Terrapass.\n- The introduction of a carbon price through taxes or cap-and-trade systems stimulates the carbon trading market.\n- Investor interest in environmental sustainability and ESG criteria is boosting the demand for carbon trading.\n- The market is expected to generate high revenue in the energy sector.\n- North America and Asia Pacific are major regions for the carbon trading market.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryN1", "reason": "The article mentions news about the carbon trading market and its projected growth"}, "sentiment": {"score": 3, "reason": "The article discusses the carbon trading market and its projected growth, which can be seen as a positive step towards reducing carbon emissions."}, "content": "![Transparency Market Research](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FT2OkH.0O9ex.BrD8arUiA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQyMDtoPTE1NQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/ad6527004e835f57e01c069b25652830)Transparency Market Research*Increasing technological advances and creative solutions in different sectors such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage are expected to fuel the market demand during the forecast period.*\n\nWilmington, Delaware, United States, July 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Transparency Market Research Inc. -** The global carbon trading market is projected to flourish at a CAGR of 19.0% from 2023 to 2031.

The ILFM is expected to replace the HIR method.\n\n\n\"It is certainly a strong view in the industry that we should be facilitating that as quickly as possible. There is some latest draft of that method (ILFM) that can be gotten out there,\" Connor said.\n\n\nHe added that the method was being fine tuned to better meet the tests of integrity and additionality.\n\n\nThe government has also set up a technical working group to modify the existing landfill-gas method that will further tighten baselines for the projects, resulting in lower ACCU generation and higher integrity.\n\n\n\"That's a third priority if you like for the government and they are working through it with the industry, but need to do that with the community as well,\" Connor said.\n\n\nHe added that getting the changes cleared this year was possible but if the government wants to go through proper negotiations, there was no clear timeline.\n\n\nConnor also highlighted the potential of the development of new methods led by the project developers, such as avoided deforestation or feral animal reductions.\n\n\n\n### Integrity\n\n\n\n\n\nThe avoided deforestation, or AD, method has faced strong criticism over lack of additionality and integrity, with S&P Global data showing that the spot market saw higher volumes of trade that excluded AD credits.\n\n\n\"It is important to state on the record that even the Chubb Review said that there was no problem with those AD units. It's just reached the end of its time,\" Connor said.\n\n\nA government-backed independent panel, headed by Australia's former Chief Scientist Ian Chubb, published its report in January and largely upheld the integrity of the current carbon market framework in Australia.\n\n\nThe review recommended discontinuing the AD method but upheld its integrity and called for additional data collection for HIR projects.\n\n\n\"One of the major detractors of the current (AD) credits' integrity are proponents of alternative AD. This issue is not going to go away particularly when we have high land clearing rates,\" he added.\n\n\nThe HIR method has also faced consistent [criticism](https://platform.platts.spglobal.com/web/client?auth=inherit#platts/newsArticle?articleID=977b6764-dc06-4ec3-87ff-6b5ea321f3fc), with two new studies by the Australian National University in June claiming that most of the HIR projects lacked integrity.\n\n\n\"I am hoping that the framework that is taking shape will throw up the bad actors or bad projects but also reward the good ones and many are passionately defending that saying they are achieving on-ground results and that the data they are submitting is showing that as well, in contrast to satellite level only data that is the basis of some alternative analysis,\" Connor said.\n\n\nStill, the HIR ACCUs have continued to attract a premium over the Generic ACCUs, with the spread between them at more than a five-month high.\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/1f7ced12-7da7-44fd-9aba-4a2930c05b0d.svg)\n\n\n\n\"All of this is pretty esoteric and not surprising that it puts off some buyers but there is still ongoing interest and investment there,\" Connor said.\n\n\n\n### New markets\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Australia does not allow exports of ACCUs overseas and is currently more focused on capacity building, Connor said there was potential for new markets outside the domestic market.\n\n\n\"There are no inflows or outflows of ACCUs yet but that may happen in time and I think certainly from the CMI perspective we want Australia to be net negative so it should be a provider in the form of supply,\" Connor said.\n\n\nHe added that as the carbon tax in Singapore increases, it could be a potential market for international offsets.\n\n\nSingapore levies a carbon tax on certain polluters, with the tax set to be increased to S$25/mtCO2e ($18.77/mtCO2e) in 2024 and 2025 and higher in later years, from S$5/mtCO2e currently.\n\n\nFrom 2024, the Singapore government has [allowed](https://platform.platts.spglobal.com/web/client?auth=inherit#platts/newsArticle?articleID=b880304d-f62f-4714-a174-1055da32460d) emitters to buy high-quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their tax-liable emissions, with exact criteria yet to be announced.\n\n\nHowever, Connor warned that this will have to be balanced with the offset requirements of the Australian businesses.\n\n\n"}], [{"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "Carbon Trading Market to Reach US$ 4.8 trillion in 2031, Expanding at a CAGR of 19.0% Says, Transparency Market Research", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carbon-trading-market-reach-us-093000702.html", "summary": "- The global carbon trading market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.0% from 2023 to 2031, reaching a valuation of US$ 4.8 trillion in 2031.\n- Environmental regulations and policies that limit greenhouse gas emissions are driving the carbon trading market.\n- Major players in the market include 3Degrees, BP, Shell, and South Pole.\n- The market is driven by the introduction of carbon pricing, growing investor interest in environmental sustainability, and the application of carbon trading in the energy sector.\n- North America and Asia Pacific are key regions for the carbon trading market.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryD1", "reason": "The article mentions companies like Shell and BP actively involved in the carbon trading market and investing in renewable energy projects and carbon offset projects."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses the growth and potential of the carbon trading market, which is aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting low-carbon development.

Putting a price on carbon emissions by developing a trading system (carbon market) to buy and sell carbon credits is one way to limit emissions. The Ministry of Power\u2019s (MoP) recent [Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023](https://powerline.net.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CCTS.pdf) aims at creating a domestic market for tracking and trading carbon credits. The policy is a step in the right direction for setting up India's compliance and voluntary carbon markets. Still, several questions remain unanswered on whether it operationalises the market. \u00a0\n\n\nThe concept of carbon credit is not new in India. The domestic carbon compliance market has existed for a long time in the form of Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) for tradable energy certificates (ESCerts) by designated consumers in industrial units from energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium, cement, chlor-alkali, fertiliser, iron & steel, paper & pulp, railways, thermal power and textile. The Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for renewable energy certificates (RECs) by generators producing electricity from clean sources like solar, wind, biomass, small hydro and municipal solid waste is another form of carbon compliance. Further, the Energy Conservation Act\u00a02001 also discusses issuing carbon credit certificates to registered entities.\n\n\nCCTS will now encompass the existing trading mechanism by transitioning from tonnes of oil equivalent (ESCerts) to carbon certificates expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. \n\n\nThe CCTS notification lays the framework and structure of the domestic carbon market. It constitutes a National Steering Committee comprising representatives from key ministries to govern the domestic carbon market. This committee will give recommendations to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for establishing emissions targets and trajectories for obligated entities under the compliance mechanism and lay guidelines for issuing and trading carbon credit certificates outside India.\n\n\nEssentially, BEE will become an administrator and develop procedures and eligibility criteria for accrediting carbon verification agencies. The Grid Controller of India will handle the meta registry for obligated and non-obligated entities under the compliance and voluntary carbon markets, respectively. Meanwhile, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will regulate the trading of certificates.\n\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) provided [a series of comments](https://ieefa.org/resources/comments-ministry-power-draft-carbon-credit-trading-scheme-ccts) in response to the draft CCTS released by the MoP in March 2023. The MoP adopted some of the suggestions, including setting up a meta registry that will be compatible with international registries, the inclusion of the non-power sector, a pathway for setting targets for emission reduction and inclusion of PAT and REC. But, the notification falls short of clarifying the operationalisation aspects, including eligible consumers, price discovery, voluntary market mechanisms and linking the domestic carbon market with the international markets to attract finance and technology.\n\n\n**Timeline for operationalising the market**\n\n\nThe notification does not provide a timeline for operationalising the carbon market, including which section of the market is likely to start first. It defines obligated entities as those notified under the compliance mechanismand non-obligated entities as those that can purchase carbon credit certificates voluntarily. This definition and stakeholder consultations held by the BEE suggest that obligated entities are those that the existing PAT scheme covers. The current cycle for [PAT](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1811051) continues until 2025. It is unclear whether the CCTS mandates all or some of these entities to transfer to the carbon credit market. As such, it will be useful to understand the timeline. Some [newspaper reports](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/voluntary-carbon-trades-to-start-in-2023-11674498997601.html) discuss starting the voluntary carbon market right away. This requires clarity on the sectors and a timeline for targets and processes.\n\n\n**Limited specification on the sectors eligible to participate in the domestic carbon market**\n\n\nThe notification states that the MoP will notify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity targets to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), based on recommendations from BEE. Obligated entities will have to achieve these targets along with any other targets, such as non-fossil energy consumption or specific energy consumption, as per the MoP\u2019s notifications. But there is no clarity on the eligibility of the sectors and industries under this scheme. The eleven sectors identified by the [National Carbon Market](https://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/publications/files/NCM%20Final.pdf) include petroleum refineries, cement, steel, chlor-alkali, aluminium, thermal power plants and fertilisers. Will the list expand to add more sectors? If yes, then the question is how will these additional sectors be identified. \n\n\n**Aligning with the existing domestic market**\n\n\nThe [Green Credit Programme\u00a0(GCP)](https://moef.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Draft-GCP-Notification-Inviting-Comments-27062023.pdf) announced by MoEFCC aims to incentivise environmentally conscious practises via trading green credits. This will be a purely voluntary market covering eight sectors, primarily affecting rural areas. The sectors focus on increasing tree cover, promoting water conservation, adopting natural and regenerative agricultural practices, improving soil health and the nutritional value of food, managing waste effectively and reducing air pollution. \n\n\nThese activities under GCP may generate green credits and carbon credits from the same activity under the carbon market. If this is so, how are the two different? What would be the potential use of green credits if they also generate carbon credits that could be sold in the domestic market? How will the two markets intersect or overlap?\n\n\n**Linkages with international carbon markets**\n\n\nIndia has been participating in the sale of carbon credits through the [Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)](https://www.india.gov.in/national-clean-development-mechanism-cdm-authority) route and private sector-driven voluntary carbon market. Between 2010 and 2022, India issued 278 million credits in the voluntary carbon market, accounting for 17% of global supply, according to the [Greenhouse Gas Emissions Special report](///Users/debabratadas/Downloads/Between%202010%20to%202022%20India%20issued%20278%20million%20credits%20in%20the%20Voluntary%20Carbon%20Market,%20accounting%20for%2017%25%20of%20global%20supply,%20according%20to%20a%20Jan.%2031%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20Special%20report%20by%20S&P%20Global%20Commodity%20Insights.) by S&P Global Commodity Insights. With the domestic carbon market now in place, it is unclear whether the global carbon credit certificates will run parallel to the domestic ones. \n\n\nIn addition, is there a need to regulate (if yes, how?) carbon credits exported for trade in the international voluntary carbon market? Such decisions will impact India\u2019s strategy to welcome foreign direct investment in decarbonisation activities.\n\n\n**Getting the pricing right for carbon credits**\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the carbon market will depend on the accuracy of carbon price discovery. If the buying price is too high, it will deter participation, especially from micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). If the selling price is too low, there will be no incentive for real emissions reduction.\n\n\nHence, a robust methodology for price discovery and some pilots will be necessary going forward. The methodology should clearly lay out the process for price discovery based on sectoral or unit-wise emission targets. It also needs structured checks and balances to ensure market stability and prevent an oversupply or overdemand of credits.\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon market requires even greater efforts as price discovery is more complex considering the variety in project sizes, location, quality, value adds, and more. The scheme seems to focus on the compliance market, providing limited guidance for non-obligated entities. Enhancing private sector participation in the voluntary carbon market needs a more structured and incentive-driven mechanism.\n\n\n**Learnings from the global voluntary carbon market**\n\n\nUnlike compliance markets, voluntary markets are usually partially regulated and market-driven. Hence, multiple agencies with their own standards, eligibility criteria and terminologies exist. [Offset standards](https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/protocols-standards/), including Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard, verify the projects and ensure they follow strict rules and maintain high environmental integrity standards. However, these standards usually only assess the original offsetting project and not the broader ecosystem, allowing companies to prioritise whatever makes the most financial sense.\n\n\nAs India sets the foundation for its domestic carbon market, it is crucial to understand the governance structure for voluntary carbon markets. Will the National Steering Committee decide the standards, or will they remain open for the industries to take a call on? Would there be interoperability between voluntary carbon credits bought or sold in the international carbon market and the domestic voluntary market?\n\n\nIEEFA welcomes the efforts taken by MoP to develop the Indian carbon market. Still, operationalising the market requires more efforts on consumer profiling, target setting, cross-ministerial coordination and robust monitoring and verification. The carbon market would help corporations become carbon neutral. In addition to the compliance market, clarity on the timeline and structure of the voluntary market is crucial considering the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) have already announced plans to explore voluntary carbon market.\n\n\n*This article was first published in [Business

News](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/category/shipping-news/international-shipping-news/),[Shipping: Emission Possible](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/category/shipping-news/shipping-emission-possible/)\n28/07/2023\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CO_Emissions_vessel_rearview-290x242-150x150.jpg)\nLSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) and Siglar Carbon, a maritime emissions analytics company, have announced an agreement to enable customers to evaluate the different carbon options for cargo programmes via Workspace.\nThe agreement will combine Siglar\u2019s emissions insights with LSEG\u2019s industry-leading European carbon markets and industry emissions analytics to help charterers, traders, brokers and ship owners understand, predict and improve the carbon consequence of commercial shipping decisions and control the related carbon cost exposure. The data will allow them to instantly locate the most carbon efficient alternative.\n\n\nFrom January 2024 shipping will be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). As part of this, shipping owners, charterers and traders will need to mitigate potential additional shipping costs by seeking more carbon efficient fleets. According to analysis from LSEG and Siglar Carbon, choosing carbon-efficient ships and route planning could drive down potential carbon emission costs for traders and charterers by as much as 50%.\n\n\nFabrice Maille, Head of Shipping & Agriculture at LSEG, comments:\n\n\n\u201cWhen trading physical commodities, it is vital to have the right data and insights when evaluating the different options for cargo programmes to cut emissions. For traders and charterers, this could halve carbon emissions costs.\n\n\n\u201cThere are already ongoing efforts to decarbonise focusing on aspects such fuels but given how quickly the ETS will come into force, planning carbon-efficient voyages is low hanging fruit logistically.\u201d\n\n\nSigmund Kyvik, Siglar Carbon CEO, comments:\n\n\n\u201cOur carbon solutions already play a pivotal role in driving decarbonisation in the shipping industry. Through LSEG, we can capitalise on its unique position and scale of its Workspace platform to bring our insights to a wider audience.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to the Siglar Carbon index, a ship carrying gasoline between Europe and the USA via the TC2 route \u2013 one of the most commonly traded tanker routes \u2013 would emit approx. 1,800 tonnes of CO2 on the round voyage. The most efficient alternative would emit approx. 1,200 tonnes and the related EU ETS cost would be approx. 25,000 USD. The least efficient choice would emit 2,500 tonnes with a EU ETS cost of 50 000 USD. In 2026, once the EU ETS is fully phased in the same cost would add up to approx. 63,000 and 125,000 USD respectively.\n\n\nFor ship owners, Siglar analysis show that a charterer or owner who is active in the European short sea market with 20 ships could generate approximately 100,000 tonnes of CO2 eligible emissions a year. At a carbon cost of USD 100 per EUA, this would mean an added cost of USD 10 million per year once the EU ETS is fully phased-in. Charterers and owners engaged in larger vessels could easily generate ETS eligible emissions close to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year with an annual carbon cost of 50 million USD.  \n\nSource: LSEG
