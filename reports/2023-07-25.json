The purchase was facilitated through the Watershed Marketplace, a curated selection of nature-based and engineered carbon removal available to all customers of Watershed, the enterprise climate platform.\n\n\nOn behalf of Block, Brilliant Planet will remove 1,500 tons of carbon by 2027 at its planned demonstration facility in Morocco. A key pillar of Block's corporate sustainability program is its commitment to becoming net zero carbon for its operations by 2030, which includes internal carbon reductions, transparent emissions disclosures, and carbon removal sourcing. Block's carbon removal portfolio spans interventions across a variety of removal types and maturity \u2013 including reforestation, biochar, biomass sequestration, and direct air capture.\n\n\n**Adam Taylor, CEO at Brilliant Planet** commented, \"We are privileged to work with Block and Watershed in our shared vision of a net-zero future.\u00a0 Early contracts with Block and other pioneering environmental leaders are important in the development of the high-integrity carbon removal sector and demonstrate to like-minded firms that solutions are actionable today.\"\n\n\n\"At Block we believe that effective corporate climate action includes a clear focus on internal reductions and a strong commitment to carbon removal,\" said **Neil Jorgensen, Global ESG Lead at Block, Inc.** \"We're proud to be working with Watershed to curate our carbon removal portfolio and invest in frontier carbon removal technology like Brilliant Planet. Providing support in the early days of these innovative projects is crucial to helping collectively secure a livable planet.\"\n\n\n\"Fighting climate change requires emissions reductions *and* carbon removals. We need to throw everything we've got at solving climate change. That's where innovators like Brilliant Planet come in,\" said **Watershed co-founder Taylor Francis.** \"We're excited to keep working with Brilliant Planet and leading companies like Block to pioneer innovative solutions to climate change.\"\n\n\nBrilliant Planet removes CO2 from the atmosphere by growing local strains of marine algae on land in coastal desert areas. Seawater is pumped through a series of open ponds, enabling natural algae blooms to continue year-round. The algae biomass is harvested, rapidly solar dried and buried underground on site, ensuring sequestered carbon remains easily verifiable and stable for over 1,000 years. Using only upwelled ocean water as a nutrient source and sunlight as energy, the exceptional productivity of year-round algae blooms enables Brilliant Planet's facilities to capture 30x more carbon per year than an equivalent area of forest, without competing for productive land.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBrilliant Planet has operated a pilot project in Southern Morocco since 2018, in addition to its previous pilot sites in South Africa (2013) and Oman (2014). They will begin construction on their demonstration site in Q2 2024 and start operations later that year. Following the construction of the demonstration site, Brilliant Planet intends to modularly increase its carbon removal capacity, reaching 1 million tons of CO2 per year by 2030.\n\n\nIn addition to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, Brilliant Planet's carbon removal method de-acidifies local coastal areas, improving biodiversity. At the same time, it creates high-quality jobs in vulnerable rural areas, enabling those that are most affected by climate change to become part of the solution.\n\n\nBy purchasing carbon dioxide removal (CDR) through the Watershed Marketplace, companies of all sizes and industries help scale the businesses at the forefront of CDR innovation while working to meet their own climate goals. Watershed's team of climate scientists and external advisors vets CDR projects for additionality, verification, durability, leakage, co-benefits, and catalytic nature.

Climate Vault works\nwith supporters, organizations and individuals to purchase and vault CO2 permits\nfrom regulated cap-and-trade compliance markets \u2014 thus keeping major polluters\nsuch as utilities from using them to emit and, theoretically, stopping pollution\nbefore it happens. Climate Vault then uses the value of vaulted permits to\nremove atmospheric carbon from verified, breakthrough CDR projects.\n\n\n### Here's how it works:\n\n\n1. Company 1 and Company 2 calculate their emissions (ex: X1 and X2 tons).\n2. Company 1 and Company 2 cover the costs associated with obtaining enough\npermits to cover X1 and X2 tons.\n3. Climate Vault purchases X1 and X2 permits on the regulated market and\n\u201clocks\u201d them away, reducing the amount of CO2 that can be emitted into the\ncompliance market.\n4. Climate Vault exchanges Company 1 and 2\u2019s permits (X1 + X2 = Y) and uses the\nfunds to purchase Y tons of carbon-dioxide removal (CDR) from a [verified\nCDR\nproject](/read/collaboration-cocreation/nature-based-solutions-indonesia-allying-communities-restoring-ecosystems).\n5. CDR purchases enable further innovation and scale in CDR solutions aimed at\npromoting greater deployment and lowered costs.\n\n\n\u201cBecause the number of allowances is capped by a governmental body and each\nallowance is serialized, keeping them off the market verifiably decreases CO2\nemissions and provides a quantifiable and immediate carbon reduction \u2014 limiting\nthe risk of\n[greenwashing](/read/defining-the-next-economy/climate-policymakers-denounce-uk-approval-of-new-net-zero-coal-mine)\nfor our clients,\u201d Cohen explained. \u201cThrough this market-based approach we can\ntrack, quantify and verify the precise amount of our carbon reductions.

JPMorgan focused its analysis on voluntary carbon markets, i.e., markets where \u201ccompanies or individuals to purchase carbon credits to meet their own emissions goals\u201d independent of markets \u201ccreated and regulated by mandatory international, national or regional carbon management regimes,\u201d (i.e., compliance markets). JPMorgan also cautioned that voluntary markets are \u201cnot a substitute for robust public policies designed to address climate change.\u201d\n\n\nUnder JPMorgan\u2019s analysis, carbon markets provide benefits to the global effort to reduce carbon emissions beyond those offered by regulatory programs for three major reasons. First, they allow companies in industries that face challenges in reducing their carbon emissions where, for instance, \u201cthe technologies necessary to address emissions may not yet be commercially available or else may still be prohibitively expensive,\u201d to offset their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits, thereby \u201cenabling greater deployment of climate solutions elsewhere in the economy.\u201d Second, by incentivizing investment, carbon markets \u201cfacilitate more rapid deployment of proven solutions, which can drive down net emissions more quickly.\u201d Third, investing in projects via carbon credits can promote other environmentally friendly actions, including reforestation efforts, or a slowing of deforestation, which increases biodiversity, reduces other forms of pollution, and promotes stronger environmental resilience.\n\n\nStill, JPMorgan recognized that carbon markets and the use of carbon credits may not be adopted on a global scale and across all industries as quickly as necessary to maintain net-zero targets without other efforts. Accordingly, it advises that companies should still devise business strategies and invest in technologies that will directly reduce their carbon emissions. While these actions may impose significant short-term capital expenses, they will likely increase business efficiency and reduce long-term costs, according to the bank. JPMorgan also cautioned that voluntary markets are \u201cnot a substitute for robust public policies designed to address climate change.\u201d\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon markets provide for trading two main forms of credits: (a) avoidance credits and (b) removal credits. Avoidance credits are created when a company takes an action that either fully prevents or reduces the amount of carbon it normally would have produced under business operations. For example, companies can generate these types of credits by transitioning to solar energy or by taking actions to reduce deforestation. Removal credits, on the other hand, are created when a company actively promotes removal of GHGs from the atmosphere. This can be accomplished through a variety of options, including nature-based solutions like reforestation, or through technological developments like investments in, or promoting the use of, carbon-capture technology. JPMorgan noted that while nature-based solutions like reforestation tend to be more readily accessible and cheaper, they only store carbon for short periods of time. Technology like carbon-capture provides long-term removal of GHGs from the atmosphere, but tends to be expensive and is not yet fully developed.\n\n\nAvoidance credits and removal credits work in tandem to complement each other. In the near-term, avoidance credits reduce the amount of GHGs released and slow the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere. In the long-term, deployment of more expensive carbon-capture technology has the potential to partially reverse historic GHG emissions and counteract the continued release of GHGs from industries where emissions-reduction is prohibitively expensive or technologically difficult. As JPMorgan observed, while the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 will largely be accomplished through reducing carbon emissions, \u201cthe large-scale removal of GHGs from the atmosphere will be [also] be necessary[.]\u201d\n\n\nJPMorgan also identified eight major factors it utilizes when assessing the value and utility of carbon credits, given widely recognized issues associated with \u201cvariation in the availability and quality of information needed to assess credit quality, resulting in a lack of confidence for many market participants.\u201d Under its framework, the GHG emission reductions underlying each carbon credit should be: (1) real and proven to have actually taken place; (2) measurable and quantifiable according to recognized methodological approaches; (3) in addition to what would have already been undertaken by the company; (4) unique and traceable to each initiative; (5) independently verified by a reputable GHG accreditation program; (6) not simply a displacement of carbon emissions from one sector of the economy to another; (7) durable and long-term; and (8) equitable by promoting and supporting marginalized communities.\n\n\nJPMorgan highlighted additional challenges facing the development of effective and efficient voluntary carbon markets. These include, in addition to a lack of quality information about each carbon credit, a scarcity of high-quality carbon credits that would promote and support large-scale efforts at decarbonization; the existence of \u201cmultiple marketplaces, competing frameworks and principles;\u201d and an inability to \u201csupport more sophisticated forms of trading, which limits its ability to meet the needs of different kinds of participants. Improved trading infrastructure and further development of advanced features such as forward market instruments and reference contracts are needed to support increased liquidity, transparency and risk management, which can contribute to greater scale and efficiency.\u201d\n\n\n**Taking the Temperature: JPMorgan\u2019s report highlights the potential value to companies of integrating high-quality carbon credits into their overall sustainability plans, while also acknowledging the challenges in doing so. The integrity of carbon credits is an ongoing source of controversy and challenge. Last year, for instance, the Chair of the International Organization of Securities Commissions [cited concerns](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=58&nid=11&search=carbon%20market) around the \u201cappropriate levels of integrity, transparency, and liquidity\u201d of voluntary markets.**\n\n\n**Of note, the integrity of credits traded on voluntary carbon markets is not outside of federal regulatory oversight. Earlier this year, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, [announced a speech](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=127&nid=28&search=carbon%20market) that the CFTC recognizes environmental products as \u201ccommodities\u201d and therefore \u201ccan play a role in voluntary [carbon] markets, and that carbon markets must be transparent and have integrity and adhere to basic market regulatory requirements.\u201d The CFTC Chair\u2019s statement [followed a letter](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=15&nid=3&search=carbon%20market) to the CFTC sent in the fall of 2022 by a group of Democratic senators asking for improved regulation of the market for carbon offsets. It remains unclear how the CFTC would exercise this authority in practice and what the implications are for the developments of voluntary markets; however, the CFTC has identified as a top priority addressing financial risks posed by climate change as well as prosecuting fraud and manipulation in carbon and environmental markets.

One big area of debate is the link between carbon storage and carbon markets.\n\n\n\n\n**New Policies** \n\n\n\n\nLast week, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $300 million investment to monitor agricultural emissions. The investment will help create a research group to monitor carbon levels in soil.\n\n\n\n\nAmerican lawmakers also proposed a measure to support research needed to \u201cproperly credit soil carbon storage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe USDA announcement and the law are both aimed at the difficult question of how to measure carbon stored in soil. The issue is important if the young soil carbon market is to avoid the opposition directed at current carbon credit markets.\n\n\n\n\n**Carbon storage** \n\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Research Services describes a carbon market as an economic idea \u201cthat supports the buying and selling of environmental **commodities** that **signify** GHG (greenhouse gas) emission reductions\u201d or storage.\n\n\n\n\nThe general idea is that some kinds of farming methods can support carbon storage. As a result, some farmers can get money in the form of carbon offsets \u2014 payments that companies can make that support carbon storage in farms.\n\n\n\n\nShalamar Armstrong is an associate professor at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. \u201cThe more carbon you store from the atmosphere with your crops, and the more crops grown throughout the year, you offset some of your waste,\u201d he said. The carbon that was stored would have instead been released into the atmosphere, he explained.\n\n\n\n\nBut much about carbon storage remains unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe science piece (of carbon credits) has really **lagged** behind, particularly when it comes to things like monitoring, reporting and **verification**,\u201d said Cristel Zoebisch, a policy director at climate organization Carbon180.\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong has been trying to help fix the problem of measuring carbon storage. He runs a lab where researchers are investigating how farming method affects the amount of carbon in soil across different kinds of land. He and others at Purdue have been studying soil samples that date back more than 40 years.\n\n\n\n\nHe hopes his findings will help farmers make decisions that could result in earnings from storing carbon and without losing any crop profit.\n\n\n\n\n**Carbon markets** \n\n\n\n\nBut other experts worry that even if farmers do get paid for storing soil carbon, bigger issues remain.\n\n\n\n\nCarbon offsets in the U.S. have to meet four conditions. They have to store carbon that would otherwise be released. The offsets also have to be verifiable in data, immediate and long-lasting, said John Sterman, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n\n\nCarbon storage research might make the offsets more verifiable, but such research does not deal with other problems.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, many American farmers do not own the land on which they grow crops. As a result, these farmers cannot guarantee that carbon stored on their land will stay in place if someone else works the same property.\n\n\n\n\nBarbara Haya of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project at University of California, Berkeley, says the research she has worked on shows that the effects of carbon offset projects are commonly overestimated. Carbon trading has, in her words, \u201cfailed miserably\u201d over the last 20 years. She advises moving away from the process.\n\n\n\n\nJared Huffman, a lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives, last month proposed a bill to support farmers in making improvements to soil health. He said farmers in the area he represents would be interested in entering carbon markets with strong accounting systems. But he added that those hoping for serious climate action should not depend only on offsets.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m John Russell.\n\n\n\n\n*Melina Walling reported on this story for the Associated Press.

JPMorgan focused its analysis on voluntary carbon markets, i.e., markets where \u201ccompanies or individuals to purchase carbon credits to meet their own emissions goals\u201d independent of markets \u201ccreated and regulated by mandatory international, national or regional carbon management regimes,\u201d (i.e., compliance markets). JPMorgan also cautioned that voluntary markets are \u201cnot a substitute for robust public policies designed to address climate change.\u201d\n\n\nUnder JPMorgan\u2019s analysis, carbon markets provide benefits to the global effort to reduce carbon emissions beyond those offered by regulatory programs for three major reasons. First, they allow companies in industries that face challenges in reducing their carbon emissions where, for instance, \u201cthe technologies necessary to address emissions may not yet be commercially available or else may still be prohibitively expensive,\u201d to offset their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits, thereby \u201cenabling greater deployment of climate solutions elsewhere in the economy.\u201d Second, by incentivizing investment, carbon markets \u201cfacilitate more rapid deployment of proven solutions, which can drive down net emissions more quickly.\u201d Third, investing in projects via carbon credits can promote other environmentally friendly actions, including reforestation efforts, or a slowing of deforestation, which increases biodiversity, reduces other forms of pollution, and promotes stronger environmental resilience.\n\n\nStill, JPMorgan recognized that carbon markets and the use of carbon credits may not be adopted on a global scale and across all industries as quickly as necessary to maintain net-zero targets without other efforts. Accordingly, it advises that companies should still devise business strategies and invest in technologies that will directly reduce their carbon emissions. While these actions may impose significant short-term capital expenses, they will likely increase business efficiency and reduce long-term costs, according to the bank. JPMorgan also cautioned that voluntary markets are \u201cnot a substitute for robust public policies designed to address climate change.\u201d\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon markets provide for trading two main forms of credits: (a) avoidance credits and (b) removal credits. Avoidance credits are created when a company takes an action that either fully prevents or reduces the amount of carbon it normally would have produced under business operations. For example, companies can generate these types of credits by transitioning to solar energy or by taking actions to reduce deforestation. Removal credits, on the other hand, are created when a company actively promotes removal of GHGs from the atmosphere. This can be accomplished through a variety of options, including nature-based solutions like reforestation, or through technological developments like investments in, or promoting the use of, carbon-capture technology. JPMorgan noted that while nature-based solutions like reforestation tend to be more readily accessible and cheaper, they only store carbon for short periods of time. Technology like carbon-capture provides long-term removal of GHGs from the atmosphere, but tends to be expensive and is not yet fully developed.\n\n\nAvoidance credits and removal credits work in tandem to complement each other. In the near-term, avoidance credits reduce the amount of GHGs released and slow the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere. In the long-term, deployment of more expensive carbon-capture technology has the potential to partially reverse historic GHG emissions and counteract the continued release of GHGs from industries where emissions-reduction is prohibitively expensive or technologically difficult. As JPMorgan observed, while the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 will largely be accomplished through reducing carbon emissions, \u201cthe large-scale removal of GHGs from the atmosphere will be [also] be necessary[.]\u201d\n\n\nJPMorgan also identified eight major factors it utilizes when assessing the value and utility of carbon credits, given widely recognized issues associated with \u201cvariation in the availability and quality of information needed to assess credit quality, resulting in a lack of confidence for many market participants.\u201d Under its framework, the GHG emission reductions underlying each carbon credit should be: (1) real and proven to have actually taken place; (2) measurable and quantifiable according to recognized methodological approaches; (3) in addition to what would have already been undertaken by the company; (4) unique and traceable to each initiative; (5) independently verified by a reputable GHG accreditation program; (6) not simply a displacement of carbon emissions from one sector of the economy to another; (7) durable and long-term; and (8) equitable by promoting and supporting marginalized communities.\n\n\nJPMorgan highlighted additional challenges facing the development of effective and efficient voluntary carbon markets. These include, in addition to a lack of quality information about each carbon credit, a scarcity of high-quality carbon credits that would promote and support large-scale efforts at decarbonization; the existence of \u201cmultiple marketplaces, competing frameworks and principles;\u201d and an inability to \u201csupport more sophisticated forms of trading, which limits its ability to meet the needs of different kinds of participants. Improved trading infrastructure and further development of advanced features such as forward market instruments and reference contracts are needed to support increased liquidity, transparency and risk management, which can contribute to greater scale and efficiency.\u201d\n\n\n**Taking the Temperature: JPMorgan\u2019s report highlights the potential value to companies of integrating high-quality carbon credits into their overall sustainability plans, while also acknowledging the challenges in doing so. The integrity of carbon credits is an ongoing source of controversy and challenge. Last year, for instance, the Chair of the International Organization of Securities Commissions [cited concerns](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=58&nid=11&search=carbon%20market) around the \u201cappropriate levels of integrity, transparency, and liquidity\u201d of voluntary markets.**\n\n\n**Of note, the integrity of credits traded on voluntary carbon markets is not outside of federal regulatory oversight. Earlier this year, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, [announced a speech](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=127&nid=28&search=carbon%20market) that the CFTC recognizes environmental products as \u201ccommodities\u201d and therefore \u201ccan play a role in voluntary [carbon] markets, and that carbon markets must be transparent and have integrity and adhere to basic market regulatory requirements.\u201d The CFTC Chair\u2019s statement [followed a letter](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=15&nid=3&search=carbon%20market) to the CFTC sent in the fall of 2022 by a group of Democratic senators asking for improved regulation of the market for carbon offsets. It remains unclear how the CFTC would exercise this authority in practice and what the implications are for the developments of voluntary markets; however, the CFTC has identified as a top priority addressing financial risks posed by climate change as well as prosecuting fraud and manipulation in carbon and environmental markets. In June of 2023, the CFTC published guidance for whistleblowers to report fraud in spot and forward carbon markets, and then announced the creation of an environmental fraud enforcement task force.

writes [RSHP](https://www.dezeen.com/tag/rogers-stirk-harbour-partners/) sustainability lead Michelle Sanchez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n**It's time to make peace with nature.** Architects should add strong biodiversity mitigation principles to their projects no matter the scale and constraints.\n\n\nSince the 2015 Paris Agreement, some organisations in the construction industry have advocated deploying all our efforts into implementing guidance, targets, and calculation tools to allow us to achieve net zero by 2050.\n\n\n\n> Sustainability as a concept goes beyond environmental impact\n> \n> \n\n\nNo doubt there is much to do in terms of carbon reduction in the industry, but by focusing all our energies and resources down that road we are forgetting two major things.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, sustainability as a concept goes beyond environmental impact. Sustainability [was defined back in 1987 by the UN](https://www.un.org/en/academic-impact/sustainability) as the balance of the environmental, economic, and social impact of any project \u2013 this is the Sustainability Triple Bottom Line. We are forgetting that sustainability engages with a far greater range of issues than carbon emissions alone.\n\n\nSecondly, our industry has a much wider negative impact beyond the 38 per cent contribution to carbon emissions and greenhouse gases. Now that we have a way forward to reducing operational and embodied carbon, we need to look at sustainability as a whole and see other areas where our industry is causing harm.\n\n\n[![Plants and trees in Rambla Climate-House by Andr\u00e9s Jaque, Office for Political Innovation and Miguel Mesa del Castillo](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Plants and trees in Rambla Climate-House by Andr\u00e9s Jaque, Office for Political Innovation and Miguel Mesa del Castillo](https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2023/01/rambla-climate-house_dezeen_2364_sq_2-191x191.jpg)Read:\n=====\n\n Rambla Climate-House shows how suburban homes can support biodiversity\n----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.dezeen.com/2023/01/13/rambla-climate-house-biodiversity-andres-jaque-and-miguel-mesa-del-castillo/)\nBiodiversity comes out as one of the big-ticket items that we need to tackle next. Infrastructure and the built environment are responsible for 29 per cent of threatened species, [according to the World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/02/biodiversity-nature-loss-cop15/).\n\n\nAnd biodiversity is more crucial to our way of life and our economy than we realise. Forty-four per cent of global GDP in cities [is estimated to be at risk of disruption from nature loss](https://www.weforum.org/press/2022/01/biodivercities-initiative-set-to-transform-global-urban-infrastructure-by-2030/). Business as usual is no longer an option \u2013 we as an industry need to do better.\n\n\nIt will benefit people, too. To return to the Sustainable Triple Bottom Line concept, having nature-based solutions embedded into our designs has a positive social impact on the local communities and building users. The enhancement of biodiversity is directly linked to the improvement of health and well-being, especially with respect to mental health. There is a direct correlation between having access to external, green spaces and the well-being of the user of that space.\n\n\n\n> Adding a 10 per cent net-gain is not enough\n> \n> \n\n\nPoliticians are slowly waking up to the issue. The [COP15](https://www.unep.org/un-biodiversity-conference-cop-15) summit has started work towards a new global pact on nature protection. In the UK, the government's [25-year Environment Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan) will require all new development in England to provide a biodiversity uplift of at least 10 per cent according to a habitat-based metric.\n\n\nThis legislation is expected to come into force in November and will need to be considered by all stakeholders in the built environment \u2013 from designers and architects to financial institutions and property consultants. But adding a 10 per cent net-gain is not enough to be able to reduce the negative impact that our way of life has had on biodiversity.\n\n\nWe need to be creative and innovative. We need to find clever ways to provide green spaces, wildlife corridors and shelter for different kinds of animals. We need to encourage pollination and generate green infrastructure at scale whenever we can.\n\n\n[![Sebastian Cox](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Sebastian Cox](https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2023/06/sebastian-cox-sq-191x191.jpg)Read:\n=====\n\n \"Britain is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet\" says Sebastian Cox\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.dezeen.com/2023/06/26/britain-nature-depleted-countries-sebastian-cox-interviews/)\nI am calling all architects and building-industry stakeholders to review their current projects against the [BiodiverCities report from the WEF](https://www.weforum.org/reports/biodivercities-by-2030-transforming-cities-relationship-with-nature/), where experts have listed a series of five key strategies that we can add to all construction projects to enhance biodiversity.\n\n\nFirst, we must make the built environment more compact. Higher-density urban development will free up land for agriculture and nature. It can also reduce urban sprawl, which destroys wildlife habitats and flora and fauna. Existing cities and settlements should be considered for strategic densification. Just like we are starting to review existing buildings and their possibility to be retained or fully retrofitted before making the decision to demolish, we should have a similar approach with any land that does not have an existing structure that could be used for other purposes than urbanising the environment.\n\n\nSecond, we must design with nature-positive approaches by having buildings that share space with nature and are less human-centric. Nature-positive strategies should not be an afterthought or a tick-box exercise to comply with a planning requirement. All developments must include nature-friendly spaces and eco-bridges to connect habitats for urban wildlife. Should we start placing biodiversity at the core of project design I am sure that we will end up generating greener and more appealing places.\n\n\n\n> It's time to rethink what we are doing as an industry\n> \n> \n\n\nWe also need planet-compatible urban utilities. To stall biodiversity loss, we need utilities that effectively manage air, water, and solid waste pollution in urban environments. In addition to benefiting nature, this will provide universal human access to clean air and water. We can implement new technologies that could transform urban utilities and make them planet-compatible.\n\n\nNature as infrastructure involves incorporating natural ecosystems into built-up areas. Instead of developments destroying floodplains, wetlands, and forests, they would form an essential part of the new built environment. This approach to development can also help deliver clean air, natural water purification and reduce the risk from extreme climate events.\n\n\nFinally, we need nature-positive connecting infrastructure such as roads, railways, pipelines, and ports. Transitions in these areas mean a change in our approach to planning to reduce biodiversity impacts, with a willingness to accept compromises to enhance biodiversity. Building in wildlife corridors and switching to renewable energy in transport are key elements of nature-positive connecting infrastructure.\n\n\n[![SOM opinion on environmental disaster](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![SOM opinion on environmental disaster](https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2019/08/wild-mile-som-opinion-doug-voigt_dezeen_2364_col_1-191x191.jpg)Read:\n=====\n\n \"The rapid deterioration of Earth's biodiversity could be reversed equally quickly if we find new ways to design our cities\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.dezeen.com/2019/08/29/climate-emergency-doug-voigt-som-opinion/)\nIt's time to rethink what we are doing as an industry and realise that by focusing so much on carbon reduction we are neglecting other areas where our industry causes much harm. We need to tackle climate change and sustainability from all fronts. We need to design in a holistic way that considers the Sustainability Triple Bottom Line and every impact related to it.\n\n\nI would like to start a call for action and to encourage architects, developers, contractors and consultants to rethink the way we design buildings and public spaces, to find strategies to add biodiversity enhancement, and to truly assess the impact that our projects have on biodiversity.\n\n\n*Michelle Sanchez is sustainability lead at [RSHP](https://rshp.com/).*\n\n\n*The photo, by Joas Souza, shows the green roof of [the Macallan Distillery in Scotland, designed by RSHP](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/05/22/rogers-stirk-habour-partners-architecture-macallan-distillery-scotland/#/).*\n\n\n***Dezeen In Depth***\n\n\n*If you enjoy reading Dezeen's interviews, opinions and features,\u00a0[subscribe to Dezeen In Depth](https://www.dezeen.com/dezeenindepth/).

It says they have greater value if treated as a carbon and biodiversity sink than if logged to produce mainly low-value products such as woodchips, pallets and power poles.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report recommends the government salvage and expand Australia\u2019s struggling plantation sector by creating a state-owned national plantation estate to \u201cincrease our domestic timber independence\u201d.\n\n[Labor faces internal fight over native forest logging despite emissions pledgeRead more](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/20/labor-native-forest-logging-environment-action-network-lean)Nearly 90% of Australian timber comes from plantations, and just 12% from native forests, but next to no tree farms have been planted since 2010 and total plantation area is in decline. Government modelling suggests at least 400,000 hectares of new plantations will be needed over the next decade to meet demand.\n\nFelicity Wade, Lean\u2019s co-convener, said the evidence suggested expanding plantations could create 1,800 regional jobs, compared with 1,100 employed in the native forest industry nationally. She said 316 party branches across 100 electorates supported stopping native forest logging on economic and environmental grounds, and focusing on developing a plan to build a \u201cvibrant 21st century plantation-based timber industry\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have some of the most carbon- and biodiversity-rich forests on the planet and we\u2019re mining them.

We need to plan what species need to be planted and where, with a plan for which manufacturing facility will take the wood and how it will get to market. We need to recognise the increased fire risks and diminishing water associated with climate change.\n\n\u201cThis kind of planning is nonexistent. The government needs to step in.\u201d\n\nThe Lean report will be at the heart of a fight to change the forestry position in Labor\u2019s national platform. A draft national platform seen by Guardian Australia [made no mention of reducing native forest logging and land-clearing](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/20/labor-native-forest-logging-environment-action-network-lean) \u2013 a long-time Lean goal.\n\nLabor is divided on the issue. The [Western Australian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/08/western-australia-to-ban-native-forest-logging-from-2024-in-move-that-blindsides-industry) and [Victorian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/23/end-of-native-logging-in-victoria-a-monumental-win-for-forests-say-conservationists) governments have promised to end native forest logging at the end of this year, and the federal ALP MP Josh Burns has urged action \u201cto save our precious natural environment and native wildlife\u201d.\n\nBut the new New South Wales Labor government supports ongoing native forest logging while [also promising to create a great koala national park](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/13/nsw-forests-face-uncertain-future-as-desperation-builds-over-major-parties-inaction-over-logging), and the [Tasmanian Labor opposition](https://taslabor.org.au/news/media-releases/labor-pledges-tasmanian-first-forestry-policy/) has accused the pro-forestry Liberal state government [of not doing enough to support the industry](https://taslabor.org.au/news/media-releases/labor-pledges-tasmanian-first-forestry-policy/).\n\n[skip past newsletter promotion](#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)Sign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon Update\n\nFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter\n\n**Privacy Notice:** Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Australian Forest Products Association, led by the former Labor cabinet minister Joel Fitzgibbon, says local forestry practices are the most sustainable in the world.\n\nThe Lean report cites [last year\u2019s state of the environment report](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/labor-says-it-wont-put-head-in-the-sand-as-it-releases-shocking-environment-report), which found Australia had one of the highest rates of species decline in the world, with habitat loss due to logging and clearing a key driver.\n\nLean says the government should substantially boost funding for forest protection and carbon storage at home and in south-east Asia, suggesting 25-30% of Australia\u2019s international climate finance funding be dedicated to preventing deforestation in the region.\n\nIts report also calls for:\n\n* Increased public funding for forest protection and restoration, recognising that scientists have estimated $1.69bn a year is needed to arrest species loss.\n* Training and support for existing native forest industry workers and Indigenous custodians to work in new conservation and plantation roles.\n* A government-owned national natural capital corporation to manage the national plantation estate and help farmers take part in carbon and biodiversity markets.\n* A nationwide restoration program focused on 252 ecosystems identified as having less than 30% of vegetation remaining.

But new analysis shows we may not be on track to meet these goals.\n\nLast year, [an area the size of Switzerland](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) was lost to deforestation, suggesting \u201cwe are far off track and trending in the wrong direction,\u201d Rod Taylor of the World Resources Institute [told](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) the BBC.\n\n### **What\u2019s happening?**\n\nEvery minute, [11 soccer fields](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) of forest are lost to deforestation around the world, according to the BBC.\n\nNew research from Global Forest Watch compared current deforestation rates with the necessary pathway to zero deforestation by 2030. The organization [found](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) that deforestation in 2022 was 1 million hectares (close to 2.5 million acres, or 1.4 million soccer fields) above the level needed to halt deforestation by 2030.\n\nThe largest portion of these losses came from Brazil, which has seen a [doubling](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) in deforestation in the past three years. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro [signed](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) the Glasgow Declaration but still relaxed enforcement of laws that fight deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.\n\n### **Why is deforestation so important to pay attention to?**\n\nForests, especially tropical rainforests, are incredible habitats and home to [millions of species](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/rain-forest/). They are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Rainforests also [absorb](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/rain-forest/) large amounts of heat-trapping gases and [regulate](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/rain-forest/) our planet\u2019s temperature.\n\n[Deforestation](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/deforestation-and-forest-degradation), on the other hand, releases carbon into the air while reducing water and soil quality. It also impacts biodiversity, as some species can only be found in those forests.\n\nThe University of Maryland found that [10% more primary rainforest](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) was lost in 2022 compared to 2021. [Primary rainforest](https://rainforests.mongabay.com/0103.htm) is a forest habitat that has never been logged or largely affected by humans. Cutting and burning that much rainforest releases the same amount of carbon pollution that [India](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) does in one year.\n\n### **What is being done about deforestation?**\n\nReplanting trees is a major step in the right direction, but it [cannot easily match](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) the benefits provided by primary forests, per the BBC. These [centuries-old habitats](https://www.treehugger.com/what-are-old-growth-forests-5120050) have improved stability, are better at absorbing and storing carbon, and host more biodiversity than forests that have been replanted recently, according to Treehugger.\n\nStory continuesThe [best tactic](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) to save our forests is to stop deforestation before it happens. That is what the Glasgow Declaration is meant to achieve, but many countries are still falling short. In order to meet those goals, we all [must take drastic steps](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) to end deforestation. Some key countries have been successful in slowing deforestation thanks to drastic policy changes.\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) and Malaysia have enacted moratoriums on logging in palm oil plantations. Indonesia is leading the charge in stopping deforestation after it [set records for deforestation](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66013854) in 2016.\n\nBrazil\u2019s future is also looking promising, as its current president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has promised to reverse the damage done by his predecessor. Under Lula, Brazil\u2019s [deforestation rate fell 68%](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/deforestation-brazils-amazon-falls-68-april-first-major-drop-under-lula-2023-05-12/) in April 2023 from the previous year.\n\nJoin our [free newsletter](https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rec0RfRBA0JqHHVCL) for **cool news** and **actionable info** that makes it easy to **help yourself** while helping the planet.\n\n"}]]}
