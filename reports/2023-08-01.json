Asia is the region most affected by climate change \u2013 WMO\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAsia is the world's \"most disaster-prone\" region, with extreme weather and climate change impacts increasing in 2022, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). \n\n\n\n\nThe [*WMO State of the Climate in Asia 2022* report](https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=22328) found the continent, which has the largest land mass, is warming faster than the global average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 81 weather, climate and water-related disasters in Asia in 2022. More than 83% of those were flood and storm events. \n\n\n\n\nThe WMO said these disasters directly impacted more than 50 million people \u2013 and 5,000 people lost their lives. It put the [economic damage at more than $36 billion](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/climate-change-impacts-increase-asia).\n\n\n\n\nChina lost more than $7.6 billion due to severe drought in 2022, while severe flooding in Pakistan saw the country receive 60% of its normal total monsoon rainfall within just three weeks, affecting almost 14% of its population. \n\n\n\n\nThe melting of most glaciers in the High Mountain Asia regionwas accelerated due to \"exceptionally warm and dry conditions\", said the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### What\u2019s the World Economic Forum doing about climate change?\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change poses an urgent threat demanding decisive action. Communities around the world are already experiencing increased climate impacts, from droughts to floods to rising seas. The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report continues to rank these environmental threats at the top of the list.\n\n\n\n\nTo limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C and as close as possible to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, it is essential that businesses, policy-makers, and civil society advance comprehensive near- and long-term climate actions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Global warming can be beaten thanks to this simple plan](https://www.weforum.org/videos/global-warming-can-be-beaten-thanks-to-this-simple-plan-da85429196)\n\n\n\nThe World Economic Forum's [Climate Initiative](https://www.weforum.org/our-impact/accelerating-climate-action) supports the scaling and acceleration of global climate action through public and private-sector collaboration. The Initiative works across several workstreams to develop and implement inclusive and ambitious solutions. \n\n\n\n\nThis includes the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, a global network of business leaders from various industries developing cost-effective solutions to transitioning to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. CEOs use their position and influence with policy-makers and corporate partners to accelerate the transition and realize the economic benefits of delivering a safer climate.\n\n\n\n\n[Contact us](https://www.weforum.org/contact-us/memberships-and-partnerships) to get involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Mission Possible Platform: Delivering industry pathways t...](https://www.weforum.org/videos/mission-possible-platform-delivering-industry-pathways-to-net-zero-emissions)\n\n\n\n\nShow\n\n\n\n\n 3. News in brief: Other top nature and climate stories this week\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSurface [ocean temperatures in Florida Keys](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/ocean-temperatures-around-south-florida-hit-hot-tub-levels-2023-07-25/) have hit levels typically found in hot tubs, according to government data. A water temperature buoy in Manatee Bay hit a high of 101.19\u00b0F (38.44\u00b0C) on 24 July.\n\n\n\n\nThe record-breaking temperatures Britain experienced last year will be considered [average by 2060 and \"cool\" by 2100](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/record-2022-temperatures-will-be-average-uk-by-2060-met-office-2023-07-27/), according to the Met Office national weather service. \n\n\n\n\nItaly has announced measures to [assist families and businesses affected by extreme climate events](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/italy-adopts-measures-tackle-extreme-climate-events-2023-07-26/). Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni approved a decree to support construction and agricultural companies in keeping their staff at home in areas experiencing extremely high temperatures.   \n\n\n\n\n\nSevere [drought in Argentina could see the country's economy shrink](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/imf-sees-drought-causing-argentina-contraction-25-2023-2023-07-25/) by 2.5% in 2023, according to International Monetary Fund. The year-end inflation rate is expected to be around 120%. Drought has greatly reduced agricultural production. \n\n\n\n\n[Climate crisis-related court cases](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-change-lawsuits-more-than-double-5-years-impacts-hit-home-2023-07-27/) have more than doubled in just five years. Some 2,180 lawsuits across 65 jurisdictions globally have been filed, as shrinking water resources and dangerous heatwaves affect millions of people, according to a report by the UN Environment Programme and Columbia University.\n\n\n\n\n 4. More on the nature and climate crisis on Agenda\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nClimate change is making wildfires more frequent and intense, which is having a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. Three experts explain how incorporating the diverse experiences of people into disaster planning, can create [more effective and equitable responses to wildfires](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/07/inclusive-disaster-response-wildfire-evacuations/). \n\n\n\n\n[Natural carbon sinks absorb roughly half of atmospheric CO2](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/07/carbon-sinks-fight-climate-crisis/). They range from the oceans and forests to elephants and fungi, and are some of the few solutions ready today for carbon removal. Protecting them is essential if they are going to help tackle the climate crisis.   \n\n\n\n\n\nClimate foreign direct investment (FDI) flows remain below their potential so the World Economic Forum has developed a guidebook to help facilitate investments. Here, two of the Forum's experts ask thought leaders in the field [why climate FDI is so important](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/07/climate-foreign-direct-investment-everything-you-need-to-know/) and how it can be invaluable in tackling the impact of global warming.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Europe has been battling wildfires amid a heatwave, with July predicted to be the hottest month on record.

Yet today, no leading CCS facility is up and fully running in the UK.\n\nUntil [Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement on Monday](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis), there were two carbon capture projects in the UK, one in Merseyside and the other in Teesside and the Humber. Two further transport and storage projects, the Viking scheme in the Humber and the Acorn scheme in Aberdeenshire, have now been given government approval. The four CCS hubs are intended to collect CO2 from multiple sources and pipe it offshore to be stored in depleting North Sea gas fields.\n\nBut, according to Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, announcing more CCS schemes at the same time as approving 100-plus new oil and gas drilling licences is like ordering a truckload of cigarettes for someone giving up smoking.\n\nHaszeldine said: \u201cThat\u2019s what yesterday\u2019s announcement was doing. CCS should be part of a package of things that you have to do \u2013 increasing renewables to switch our energy from burning gas and oil, doubling or even quadrupling the amount of electricity we have now, building in more efficiency in how we use our energy with insulation. It should be part of this package.\u201d\n\nCCS involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities, such as chemical plants and oil refineries, then transporting and storing it.\n\nThe UK\u2019s geology is suitable for storing carbon, and empty oilfields in the North Sea have been selected for storage. CCS is intended to be used in the transition to net zero to capture carbon from industries that will be harder to decarbonise, including cement, iron and steel, according to Haszeldine.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn these industries, CCS can help and will be essential to get to net zero.\u201d\n\nA second nascent industry in capturing CO2 from the atmosphere is less developed than CCS linked to industrial facilities. The process of removing CO2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions.\n\nJim Watson, professor of energy policy and director of the Institute for Sustainable Resources at University College London, said he understood the scepticism of some environmentalists about CCS because it could be viewed as \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for oil and gas companies to continue getting fossil fuels out of the ground.\n\nWatson said: \u201cBut we do need it. If you look at independent assessments, including from the climate change committee, it is hard to see how to decarbonise the whole of industry without some carbon capture and storage.\u201d\n\nThe history of CCS in the UK is chequered. One of the first CCS strategies was in 2006, and there have been many false starts over the years.\n\nEven today, some projects already operating around the world have not been as successful as planned. In Australia, the CCS project run by Chevron has not yet made its Gorgon project meet its target of 80% carbon dioxide capture.\n\nA recent report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) on two Norwegian projects that store carbon dioxide under the seabed called into question the long-term viability of CCS.\n\nIts author, Grant Hauber, IEEFA\u2019s strategic energy finance adviser, said the Norwegian Sleipner and Sn\u00f8hvit CCS fields have been cited as global success stories, but because of the unpredictability of the subsurface conditions they cannot be used as definitive models for the future of the industry.\n\nHauber said: \u201cEvery project site has unique geology. Subsurface conditions which exist at a given point on the Earth are specific to that place. Even then, any information obtained about that place is only a snapshot in time. The Earth moves and strata can change.\u201d\n\nThere is also a need to make sure the CO2 is stored in the ground permanently rather than allowing fossil fuel companies to use it to drill for more oil and gas elsewhere. This requires regulation and monitoring, said Watson.\n\nThe timeframe for CCS is tight. The UK target is to raise the amount of CO2 captured from zero today to between 20m and 30m tonnes by 2030.\n\nWatson said: \u201cThere are still big questions about whether it can deliver the kind of numbers of storage that we need by this time.\u201d\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The UK government has approved two additional carbon capture projects, bringing the total number of projects to four.

It\u2019s a tension poised to intensify as the California Air Resources Board navigates a transformation of the energy economy.\n\nCentral to the debate is the question of whether California should tighten the reins on industrial emitters by strengthening its cap-and-trade program, which established an emissions trading system aimed at cutting emissions while providing flexibility for industry.\n\nIn its 2022 [climate change roadmap](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/2022-sp.pdf), the agency placed heavy bets on emerging technologies to remove carbon pollution from the atmosphere, setting a target to reduce emissions across the economy to 48% below 1990 levels by 2030 - an increase from the previous 40%. \n\nBut Air Board staff now say those technologies may not be widely available in time. As a result, they say relying solely on cap-and-trade could drive carbon prices to unmanageable heights and push industrial polluters out of California. \n\nDave Clegern, an Air Board spokesman, emphasized the need to overcome carbon removal infrastructure challenges to attain the ambitious 48% reduction goal. \n\n\u201cIf those tools are not widely available by 2030 with a 48% target, then prices get very high in the program and that leads to leakage \u2014 production moving out of state to reduce emissions in state and comply with the program,\u201d Clegern said in a statement. \n\nHe asserted that California is still on track to achieve its lower, legally mandated target to reduce emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Clegern also hinted at the possibility of exploring alternative approaches to achieve the higher target. \n\nThese obstacles come as no surprise to climate experts who have long warned that California is at risk of missing its 2030 climate goals. In the past, the Air Board agency [faced criticism](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4656) for lacking a clear implementation strategy of its climate plan and relying on optimistic assumptions.\n\nThe cap-and-trade program itself has faced sustained criticism for not effectively curbing industrial emissions and burdening communities already plagued by high pollution levels. Under this program, the state sets a limit on emissions allowed from power plants, refineries and factories, which are then issued permits that can be bought, sold or traded.\n\nDanny Cullenward, a climate economist who serves as an advisor to the state, said the Air Board appears to be \u201claying the groundwork for a blame shift\u201d by conditioning the program\u2019s strengthening on carbon removal technologies. \n\n\u201cThis is how you begin to say, \u2018It\u2019s not our fault that we can\u2019t get there,\u2019\u201d Cullenward said. \u201c\u2019We are unable to do the things we want to do because somebody else didn\u2019t follow through.\u2019\u201d\n\nCritics including environmental justice advocates have voiced opposition to the Air Board\u2019s heavy reliance on nascent technologies such as [carbon capture](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article273962810.html) and storage and green [hydrogen](https://business.ca.gov/industries/hydrogen/), expressing skepticism about their feasibility.\n\nBut Air Board staff expressed confidence it could meet the ambitious 2030 target in its scoping plan until last week.\n\nAt a Thursday [workshop](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/nc-CapTradeWorkshop_July272023_0.pdf), deputy executive officer Rajinder Sahota questioned the viability of those exact technologies, according to several attendees. Meeting slides show that Sahota indicated that achieving the 2030 scoping plan target would necessitate several extraordinary feats. \n\nThey include a significant expansion of green hydrogen (462 times current levels) and removing 20 million tons of carbon dioxidefrom the atmosphere, amounting to an annual emissions reduction of 5%. For context, emissions only fell 9% during pandemic lockdowns. \n\nThe carbon capture and storage industry must also overcome significant pipeline permit challenges.\n\n\u201cImplicit in (Sahota\u2019s) comments was the possibility that we will not achieve it,\u201d said Michael Wara, a Stanford University climate policy expert who participated in the workshop. \n\nWara said it was the first time he saw agency staff appear to wrestle with the implementation of their own climate goals. He raised the concern that inflated carbon prices would drive up costs for both industries and consumers, particularly Californians still driving gas vehicles who can\u2019t afford to buy electric.\n\nThe agency plans to make decisions on the future of cap-and-trade quickly, with members of the public having only three weeks to submit comments with full calculations of economic costs and benefits.\n\n\u201cToday was a day when ARB acknowledged how hard it will be to achieve the 2030 target,\u201d Wara said. \u201cThe target is really science based, and ARB is tasked with making that possible in the real world. That is hard.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published July 31, 2023, 5:00 AM.\n\n\n\n\n[![Profile Image of Ari Plachta](https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/89v0h8/picture276979848/alternates/FREE_480/ari_new.jpeg)](/profile/263065408)\n\n\n###### \n[Ari Plachta](/profile/263065408)\n\n\n\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/ariplachta)\n[email](mailto:aplachta@sacbee.com)\n[phone\n916-321-1374](tel:916-321-1374)\n\n\n\nAri Plachta is a climate reporter for The Sacramento Bee.

North America's leading developer and supplier of forest carbon offsets, today announced the launch of a new initiative that will allow landowners with 40-5,000 acres of forestland to generate long-term revenue by efficiently enrolling in a carbon offset program. The collaboration will allow landowners in 13 southeastern states to enroll land beginning today.\n\n\n\n\n\n> \u201cFor more than a decade, Finite Carbon has played a leading role advancing carbon markets in the United States, developing best practices, driving innovation and technological advancement to benefit landowners and buyers of natural climate solutions\u201d\n> \n> [Tweet this](#)\n\n\n\nLandYield provides payments to U.S. non-industrial forest landowners to defer commercial timber harvests and increase the carbon stored on their lands. Enrolled landowners commit to significant management changes, which in turn deliver long-term climate benefits. Landowners in LandYield\u2019s program make a 40-year commitment \u2013 growing stands for 20 years and then maintaining that stocking for an additional 20 years. These offset projects are developed and verified under the American Carbon Registry\u2019s (ACR) peer-reviewed methodology, Improved Forest Management on Small Non-Industrial Private Forestlands (SNIPFL), designed specifically for family forests.\n\n\n\n\nCreating family landowner access to carbon markets, previously only accessible to larger, institutional landowners, allows the potential for carbon revenues to be spent locally, helping support rural economies. Participating landowners also help maintain recreational values, protect water resources, and improve habitat quality on enrolled lands.\n\n\n\n\nLandYield leverages Finite Carbon\u2019s CORE Carbon\u00ae platform (the \u201cplatform\u201d) to reduce measurement and verification costs and deliver more value to landowners. The platform allows LandYield to provide eligible landowners immediate estimates of the amount of revenue they can potentially earn. Through streamlined online enrollment, project development and ongoing monitoring infrastructure, CORE Carbon ensures the resulting offsets are verified and represent a quantifiable capture of carbon.\n\n\n\n\nFinite Carbon developed CORE Carbon using innovative remote sensing technology enabled by satellite imagery alongside data from the U.S. Forest Service to measure and monitor forest growth. This information is used to calculate the specific carbon dioxide emission reductions and removals which can result from improved forest management practices on a given piece of land.\n\n\n\n\nLandYield benefits from administrative support of Mercuria Energy, one of the world\u2019s largest independent energy and commodity groups, for expertise in sales, operations and risk management, to leverage the CORE Carbon platform, to achieve meaningful scale, and offer landowners access to long term arrangements providing a reliable, quarterly payment schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe innovative and complimentary skill sets of LandYield and Finite Carbon are ideally suited to provide assurance to landowners that they\u2019re enrolling their land in a carbon program designed to provide financial and environmental benefits for the long-term,\u201d said Josh Fain, LandYield Director. \u201cOur program provides landowners the flexibility to continue to utilize their land while creating a transparent and attractive revenue stream.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n**Program details**\n\n\n\nLandowners have the flexibility to enroll only a portion of their forestlands in the program as well as the ability to pursue other commercial activities such as leasing hunting rights and collecting non-timber forest products.\n\n\n\n\nLandowners are compensated quarterly as they meet the reporting and monitoring obligations set forth by the program. This process is managed through the CORE Carbon platform which simplifies monitoring and communication through an intuitive, user-friendly dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor more than a decade, Finite Carbon has played a leading role advancing carbon markets in the United States, developing best practices, driving innovation and technological advancement to benefit landowners and buyers of natural climate solutions,\u201d said Sean Carney, CEO of Finite Carbon. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to team up with LandYield to create long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with a broad range of landowners by providing a financial incentive for their environmental stewardship so people can enjoy their land for generations to come.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe program is initially open to eligible landowners in the southeastern U.S. The region, which includes between 105-120 million acres of family-owned forest land, covers Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.

According to the latest United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u00a0[Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/), achieving that goal will require both large-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and removal of GHGs from the atmosphere.\n\n  \n\n\nAt present, the most efficient and scalable GHG-removal strategy is the massive planting of trees through reforestation or afforestation \u2014 a \u201cnatural climate solution\u201d (NCS) that extracts atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and soil carbon sequestration.\n\n  \n\n\nDespite the potential of forestry-based NCS projects to address climate change, biodiversity loss, unemployment, and other societal needs \u2014 and their appeal to policymakers, funders, and citizens \u2014 they have yet to achieve critical mass, and often underperform due to a mix of interacting ecological, social, and financial constraints. To better understand these challenges and identify opportunities to overcome them, a team of researchers at\u00a0[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/)\u00a0and the\u00a0[MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](https://globalchange.mit.edu/)\u00a0recently studied how environmental scientists, local stakeholders, and project funders perceive the risks and benefits of NCS projects, and how these perceptions impact project goals and performance. To that end, they surveyed and consulted with dozens of recognized experts and organizations spanning the fields of ecology, finance, climate policy, and social science.\n\n  \n\n\nThe team\u2019s\u00a0[analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2023.1216175/full?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE), which appears in the journal\u00a0*Frontiers in Climate,*found two main factors that have hindered the success of forestry-based NCS projects.\n\n  \n\n\nFirst, the ambition \u2014 levels of carbon removal, ecosystem restoration, job creation, and other environmental and social targets \u2014 of selected NCS projects is limited by funders\u2019 perceptions of their overall risk. Among other things, funders aim to minimize operational risk (e.g., Will newly planted trees survive and grow?), political risk (e.g., Just how secure is their access to the land where trees will be planted?); and reputational risk (e.g., Will the project be perceived as an exercise in \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d or fall way short of its promised environmental and social benefits?). Funders seeking a financial return on their initial investment are also concerned about the dependability of complex monitoring, reporting, and verification methods used to quantify atmospheric carbon removal, biodiversity gains, and other metrics of project performance.\n\nWant more breaking news?\n------------------------\n\nSubscribe to *Technology Networks*\u2019 daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.\n\n[Subscribe for FREE](https://go.technologynetworks.com/subscribe-to-breaking-science-news)Second, the environmental and social benefits of NCS projects are unlikely to be realized unless the\u00a0local communities impacted by these projects are granted ownership over their implementation and outcomes. But while engaging with local communities is critical to project performance, it can be challenging both legally and financially to set up incentives (e.g., payment and other forms of compensation) to mobilize such engagement.\n\n  \n\n\n\u201cMany carbon offset projects raise legitimate concerns about their effectiveness,\u201d says study lead author\u00a0[Bonnie Waring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.waring), a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London. \u201cHowever, if nature climate solution projects are done properly, they can help with sustainable development and empower local communities.\u201d\n\n  \n\n\nDrawing on surveys and consultations with NCS experts, stakeholders, and funders, the research team highlighted several recommendations on how to overcome key challenges faced by forestry-based NCS projects and boost their environmental and social performance.\n\n  \n\n\nThese recommendations include encouraging funders to evaluate projects based on robust internal governance, support from regional and national governments, secure land tenure, material benefits for local communities, and full participation of community members from across a spectrum of socioeconomic groups; improving the credibility and verifiability of project emissions reductions and related co-benefits; and maintaining an open dialogue and shared costs and benefits among those who fund, implement, and benefit from these projects.\n\n  \n\n\n\u201cAddressing climate change requires approaches that include emissions mitigation from economic activities paired with greenhouse gas reductions by natural ecosystems,\u201d says\u00a0[Sergey Paltsev](https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey), a co-author of the study and deputy director of the MIT Joint Program. \u201cGuided by these recommendations, we advocate for a proper scaling-up of NCS activities from project levels to help assure integrity of emissions reductions across entire countries.\u201d\n\n  \n\n\n**Reference:**Waring BG, Gurgel A, K\u00f6berle AC, Paltsev S, Rogelj J.

Companies pay for a tonne of carbon reduced through forest protection and restoration to counter emissions they are continuing to emit, or have emitted in the past.** \n\n\nIt sounds like a a win-win. A company gets a step closer to telling its investors and consumers it\u2019s reached net zero, and critical forest protection gets an injection of cash.\n\n\nThese days, forests generate a *lot* of credits: they represent one in three carbon credits sold through Verra, the largest of the voluntary carbon market administrators.\u00a0\n\n\nBut this market is plagued with problems. It [routinely inflates its climate impact](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe), diverts money to middlemen who cream off profits, and exploits Indigenous communities. High-profile investigations have exposed widespread malpractice.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> [**G20 climate talks** fail to deliver emission cuts despite leadership pleas](https://climatechangenews.com/2023/07/28/g20-climate-negotiations-fail-ministers-us-china/)\n> \n> \n\n\nThat scrutiny should not stop, because the most dangerous element of exploiting forests for carbon credits still exists: businesses buy credits as a shortcut to meet their net zero targets while continuing to pump out emissions. \n\n\nForest offsets, no matter how incredible trees\u2019 role in tackling climate change is, are simply not equivalent to cutting emissions: storing carbon in trees isn\u2019t always a long-term bet to keep carbon out of the atmosphere. \n\n\nDeforestation, decay, or fire (as we have recently seen in Canada) can release it back into the atmosphere within hours. The only sure way to slow down climate change and meet net zero goals is to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTo understand the risks of forest carbon credits being sold as offsets, take a look at Guyana: a story of zombie carbon credits, dubious accounting, and a cosy relationship between offset schemes and the oil industry.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> [**UN deep-sea** mining talks deadlocked over agenda clash](https://climatechangenews.com/2023/07/27/un-deep-sea-mining-talks-deadlocked-over-agenda-clash/)\n> \n> \n\n\nGuyana\u2019s story begins with a calculated overstatement of the risk of deforestation. A report written by McKinsey in 2009 claimed that the country\u2019s forests could disappear at a rate of more than 4% per year, gone entirely within 25 years.\n\n\n Independent assessments show that the true rate of deforestation was actually around 0.2%. But the inflated McKinsey estimate had already established an attention-grabbing baseline number that would set the project up to report an impressive \u2013 but false \u2013 impact.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn a deal set up with the Norwegian government, Guyana received four payments totalling nearly $200 million for \u2018avoided deforestation\u2019. Recently, Guyana sold 33.5 million carbon credits for reducing forest loss during 2016 and 2020, this time under an ART-TREEs crediting scheme. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBut analysis of the methodology used shows that, as with previous payments to Guyana, the \u2018emissions reductions\u2019 may be largely fictitious. According to [one analysis](https://carbon-pulse.com/185976/), some 84% of these credits were created by accounting manipulations allowed under the scheme. \n\n\nIndependent evidence also suggests deforestation actually rose during the crediting period.

The Hess Corporation, which has a 30% stake in a deal exploiting oil from Guyana\u2019s recently-opened Starbroek offshore oil block, [announced](https://hess.gcs-web.com/node/33011/pdf) its intention to buy $750 million of credits generated by Guyana forest projects to offset its emissions. \n\n\nBut in comparison to the 33 million tonnes of carbon supposedly captured by the scheme so far, the oilfield could, over its lifetime, release up to 5.5 *billion* tonnes of carbon. That\u2019s 166 times as much.\u00a0\n\n\nA race to the bottom of offset standards permitted the creation of millions of \u2018zombie carbon credits\u2019 used to justify oil drilling.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n> [**UN climate fund** suspends project in Nicaragua over human rights concerns](https://climatechangenews.com/2023/07/26/un-fund-gcf-human-rights-nicaragua-indigenous-people/)\n> \n> \n\n\nBut can we blame forest nations for looking to exploit a promising source of finance?

[Deloitte](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3931489-1&h=527991755&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.deloitte.com%2Fus%2Fen.html&a=Deloitte)\u00a0today announced its [\"2023 Financial Services Industry

report, which outlines emerging trends across the banking & capital markets, insurance, real estate, and investment management sectors. The report highlights the impact of data and emerging technologies, products and services, and climate change on the future of financial services \u2013 and as a result, on society and the economy.\n\n\n\"The reality is that emerging technological changes could be more pervasive and impactful going forward in ways that can be scarcely imagined today,\" said Jim Eckenrode, managing director, Deloitte Center for Financial Services. Deloitte Services LP. \"Financial services will likely play an important role in helping these breakthroughs emerge to the benefit of us all, while simultaneously opening up new avenues of revenue and profit.\"\n\n\nSome of Deloitte's predictions for the financial services industry over the next decade:\n\n\n**Generative AI is expected to boost productivity:**\u00a0Generative AI is expected to have a significant impact on the investment banking industry and the financial services industry as a whole, as organizations explore ways to harness the power of the technology to improve productivity. Deloitte predicts the top 14 global investment banks could boost their front-office productivity by an average of 25% by using Generative AI (GAI), thereby earning potentially an additional revenue of $3 million per front-office employee in 2026, from an average of $11.3 million during 2020-22.\n\n\n**Demand for carbon credit offset financing**: Deloitte predicts that global consumers will purchase $115 billion of carbon offsets a year by 2030. Carbon credits will likely be embedded in many of the purchasing decisions that consumers make in their day-to-day lives. The surge in demand for these credits could produce new trading networks that offer tailored, localized and niche options for climate change mitigation projects. Banks could be instrumental in developing and supporting the back-end infrastructure that connect brands' payment processes to the carbon credit market. And banks can play an instrumental role in developing and supporting the carbon credit market.\n\n\n**Insurers prepare for driverless vehicles**: Deloitte estimates advancements in self-driving technology may eliminate the need for around 380,000 long-haul truck drivers in the next five years. This alone would have a major impact on workers' compensation insurers, with a potential loss of around $3 billion worth of premiums. But widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could also result in a shift in premiums across multiple insurance lines, including commercial auto, product and professional liability, and cyber coverage.\n\n\n**Office space to fill the affordable housing gap:** Deloitte predicts office-to-residential conversions could become profitable within the next five years, estimating that around 14,700 affordable units in central business districts across the country can be added by 2030, assuming approximately 20% of converted square footage can be earmarked for affordable housing.\n\n\n\"As financial services firms grapple with what's on the horizon, they need to think about how the landscape is radically shifting,\" said Monica O'Reilly, Vice Chair, US Financial Services Industry Leader, Deloitte & Touche LLP. \"Market and economic pressures, emerging technologies, and new revenue opportunities will impact tomorrow's business strategies, and financial services firms should prepare for that now.\"\n\n\nAdditional trends included in the report that are expected to shape the financial services industry:\n\n\n**Democratization of financial advice**: Financial advice shouldn't just be for the wealthy anymore \u2014 and it doesn't have to be. Financial firms can leverage robo-advisory platforms to bring much-needed financial advice to the global mass market *and* make it profitable. Deloitte estimates net financial wealth held by the mass retail population segment globally to almost double to $22 trillion by 2030.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Synthetic identity fraud could trigger need for more sophisticated biometric security systems:** Synthetic identity fraud\u2014a hoax in which cybercriminals create new identities with some stolen or fabricated data \u2014 is the fastest growing financial crime in the United States,i\u00a0and it shows no sign of abating. Deloitte expects it to generate at least $25 billion in losses by 2030, prompting banks to develop more advanced biometric security systems to weed out would-be perpetrators.\n\n\n**Higher deposit costs expected to challenge banks:** Deloitte predicts the average cost of interest-bearing deposits for the U.S. banking industry in 2024 and 2025 to remain elevated at 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively, even as the fed funds rate declines from the recent peak. This may crimp bank profitability in the medium term.\n\n\n**Real-time B2B payments could take off:** Deloitte expects real-time payments could tap an addressable market of $12 trillion in check-based business-to-business (B2B) transaction volume globally by 2028. Banks and payment firms could play a pivotal role in helping usher in a new era of more efficient and instant domestic and cross-border value exchange among businesses.\n\n\n**Rise of embedded insurance:**\u00a0Embedded finance, and particularly embedded insurance, is expected to continue to expand. Execution may not be easy for insurers, though, and it could take the rest of the decade for embedded finance to fully shake out.\n\n\n**Increased spending on quantum computing**: Spending on quantum-related capabilities will likely grow quickly over the next few years as indicated by the increased capital investments and patent filings for the hardware technology.\u00a0Globally, the financial services industry's spending on quantum computing capabilities is expected to grow 233x from just US$80 million in 2022 to US$19 billion in 2032, growing at a 10-year CAGR of 72%.\n\n\n**Alternative data in investment management:** Deloitte estimates the revenue for alternative data providers, earned from all industries globally with the majority coming from investment management firms, to grow 29x between 2022 and 2030. The new data largely consist of novel types and forms of data such as satellite images, social media posts, geolocation data, credit card transactions, and mobile application data that are starkly different from the traditionally structured financial data.\n\n\n**Funding for climate hardtech**: An additional US$2 trillion in private hardtech investment is predicted to be needed to help effectively slow global warming.\u00a0Most of total climate funding will likely need to come from the private sector \u2014 but so far, there isn't enough. Financial services organizations can play a lead role in bridging the funding gap.\n\n\n**About Deloitte**  \nDeloitte provides industry-leading audit, consulting, tax and advisory services to many of the world's most admired brands, including nearly 90% of the Fortune 500\u00ae and more than 7,000 private companies.\u00a0Our people [come together](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3931489-1&h=4007128772&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.deloitte.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpages%2Fabout-deloitte%2Farticles%2Fcome-together-corporate-social-impact.html%3Fid%3Dus%3A2el%3A3pr%3Acometog%3Aawa%3Agreendot%3A11112020%3Aboilerplate&a=come+together) for the greater good and work across the industry sectors that drive and shape today's marketplace \u2014 delivering measurable and lasting results that help reinforce public trust in our capital markets, inspire clients to see challenges as opportunities to transform and thrive, and help lead the way toward a stronger economy and a healthier society.

symbolism, it was perfect for Rishi Sunak [to fly in a private jet](https://inews.co.uk/news/scotland/rishi-sunak-flying-scotland-private-jet-carbon-capture-project-2515293?ico=in-line_link) from London to Aberdeenshire to announce a new carbon capture project. \n\nA private jet is one of the most climate-destructive modes of travel that is enjoyed by a tiny fraction of humanity. How can such an oversized environmental footprint be justified? With carbon dioxide removal. The argument goes that if we plant lots of trees as a result of that flight, then as the trees grow they will absorb the hundreds of kilogrammes of carbon dioxide that the aircraft put into the atmosphere.\n\nTypically, this is called carbon offsetting and it is now quite common to be asked by an airline if you would like to offset your emissions.\n\nUnfortunately, there is now [overwhelming evidence](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/airlines-carbon-offsets-solution-climate-change-wrong/) that carbon offsetting schemes have [systemic problems](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/airlines-carbon-offsets-solution-climate-change-wrong/), with the vast majority of them doing [absolutely nothing](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/buying-carbon-offsets-for-your-flight-doesnt-help/) to reduce climate impacts. The fundamental issue is one of timescales.\n\nWhen fossil fuels are burnt, they release carbon into the air that has previously been locked up in rocks for millions of years. In carbon dioxide form, it has a warming effect on the climate. This warming effect can last for centuries. Most carbon offsetting schemes are \u201cdeferred emissions\u201d. That is, you pay for someone or some organisation to *not* destroy a forest. \n\nKeeping say 100kg of carbon in trees that are not going to be cut down allows you to put 100kg into the air via a jet aircraft trip. Unsurprisingly, this has produced schemes of questionable quality, e.g. pristine forests at no risk of destruction that continue to produce carbon credits used by individuals and corporations to carry on polluting.\n\nEven schemes that plant new trees are not a long-term solution. Having a tree store carbon in its roots and leaves isn\u2019t much help if the tree burns down after a few years or decades. The carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere and stored somewhere where it cannot get back out.\n\nWhat the Prime Minister was announcing in Scotland was that the UK Government was supporting the [Acorn carbon capture and storage](https://www.theacornproject.uk/projects) project that would do just that. This news was announced at the same time as the UK Government granting new licenses for oil and gas extraction in the North Sea.\n\nMr Sunak claimed that this does not mean the UK is backsliding on its net-zero commitments. Just like offsetting his private jet flight, the UK can offset the millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide that would be released from all the extra drilling with carbon capture and storage. Moreover, this would create thousands of new jobs for Scotland and the rest of the UK.\n\nYou can understand carbon capture and storage as running the fossil fuel industry in reverse. Rather than extracting carbon, companies such as Shell \u2013 one of the Acorn project\u2019s partners \u2013 will capture carbon dioxide from industrial processes or even directly from the atmosphere, then pipe it down into empty oil and gas deposits.\n\nThe good news is that this avoids all the issues with trees and land use that besets traditional offsetting. The bad news is it doesn\u2019t work. \n\nShell is involved in the Gorgon carbon and storage pilot project in Western Australia. This facility is billions over budget and years behind delivery. It was recently disclosed that is only operating [at about one-third capacity](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-17/chevron-australia-carbon-capture-storage-gorgon-third-capacity/102357652). It is proving very difficult to pump concentrated carbon dioxide deep into the ground and have it stay there.\n\nDirect capture of carbon dioxide is currently very energy intensive. One study concluded that deploying it at scale [could cost hundreds of trillions of dollars](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/8/577/2017/esd-8-577-2017.pdf) while consuming a quarter of global electricity generation. Projects that use biomass burning to generate electricity and then capture the carbon dioxide [would further accelerate forest destruction](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63089348).\n\nRelated Article\n---------------\n\n[![Oil giants to avoid new windfall tax as Government wants to encourage North Sea drilling](https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SEI_166066510.jpg?w=640&h=360&crop=1)](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/oil-giants-avoid-new-windfall-tax-government-encourage-north-sea-drilling-2519463?ico=related_article_inline \"Oil giants to avoid new windfall tax as Government wants to encourage North Sea drilling\")[Politics](https://inews.co.uk/category/news/politics?ico=related_article_inline)[Oil giants to avoid new windfall tax as Government wants to encourage North Sea drilling\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/oil-giants-avoid-new-windfall-tax-government-encourage-north-sea-drilling-2519463?ico=related_article_inline \"Oil giants to avoid new windfall tax as Government wants to encourage North Sea drilling\")[Read More](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/oil-giants-avoid-new-windfall-tax-government-encourage-north-sea-drilling-2519463?ico=related_article_inline \"Oil giants to avoid new windfall tax as Government wants to encourage North Sea drilling\")Wouldn\u2019t it be much easier to simply not put the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in the first place? Yes it would.

It allows politicians like Mr Sunak to continue to claim they are keeping their climate promises while facilitating the pumping up of more oil and gas.\n\nThey argue that we can reap the benefits of fossil fuels now, while others will pay for the clean-up later. The \u201cothers\u201d here are our children and people not even born yet, because they will need to run carbon removal schemes for decades, potentially centuries, in order to drag concentrations back down from dangerous levels.\n\nToday\u2019s announcements further demonstrate that carbon dioxide removal is a dangerous flight of fantasy.\n\n**James Dyke is an associate professor in earth system science at Exeter University**\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Rishi Sunak flew in a private jet from London to Aberdeenshire to announce a new carbon capture project, despite private jets being environmentally destructive.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Private jets have a large environmental footprint and contribute to climate change."}, {"summary": "Carbon offsetting schemes, including planting trees, have systemic problems and do not effectively reduce climate impacts.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Carbon offsetting schemes have been found to be of questionable quality and often allow individuals and corporations to continue polluting."}, {"summary": "The Acorn carbon capture and storage project was announced by the UK Government, which would capture carbon dioxide and store it in empty oil and gas deposits.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Carbon capture and storage avoids the issues with traditional offsetting and could potentially create new jobs."}, {"summary": "Direct capture of carbon dioxide is currently very energy intensive and expensive, with potential negative impacts on forest destruction.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Direct carbon capture is costly, energy-intensive, and could accelerate forest destruction."}, {"summary": "Proposed carbon capture and storage endeavors, like the Acorn project, are criticized as buy-now-pay-later schemes that allow politicians to continue to support oil and gas exploration while claiming to keep climate promises.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Carbon capture projects are seen as delaying the transition away from fossil fuels and relying on future generations to clean up the emissions."}], "semantic_commentary": "Private jet travel contradicts commitment to reducing carbon emissions.\nCarbon offsetting schemes have limitations in reducing climate impacts.\nAcorn project aims to capture and store carbon dioxide.\nDirect carbon capture requires significant energy and expense.\nCriticism of carbon capture as an excuse for supporting fossil fuels.", "sentiment_score": -0.6, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the Acorn carbon capture and storage project which aims to remove carbon from the atmosphere"}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article criticizes carbon offsetting schemes and mentions the Acorn project as a buy-now-pay-later scheme"}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article discusses news about carbon capture and storage projects"}]}, {"source": "openPR.com", "link": "https://www.openpr.com/news/3149838/carbon-credits-market-trends-research-insights-by-2032", "title": "Carbon Credits Market Trends & Research Insights by 2032", "content": "\n\n[![openPR Logo](/fx/openpr-logo-slogan.svg \"openPR\")](https://www.openpr.com/ \"openPR\")\n\nPress release\n\n\nCarbon Credits Market Trends & Research Insights by 2032\n========================================================\n\n\n\n\n 07-31-2023 10:53 AM CET | [Energy & Environment](/news/categories2-4-Energy-Environment.html)  \n\nPress release from: [Allied Analytics LLP](/news/archive/144934/Allied-Analytics-LLP.html \"archive und pressrelease of Allied Analytics LLP\")\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[![Carbon Credits Market Trends & Research Insights by 2032](https://cdn.openpr.com/W/7/W731276615_g.jpg)](https://cdn.openpr.com/W/7/W731276615_g.jpg \"Carbon Credits Market Trends & Research Insights by 2032\")\n\n\nCarbon credits are a key component of carbon trading and carbon offset programs, designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and combat climate change. The basic concept revolves around assigning a monetary value to a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions reduced or removed from the atmosphere. One carbon credit is typically equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases.  \n  \nThe carbon credits market size was valued at $2 billion in 2022, and is estimated to reach $143.5 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 55.5% from 2023 to 2032.  \n\n\n\n  \nGet a PDF brochure for Industrial Insights and Business Intelligence: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/107610  \n  \nCarbon credits, also known as carbon offsets, are tradable units that represent a reduction or removal of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the atmosphere. They are used as a tool to mitigate climate change by enabling individuals, organizations, and governments to take responsibility for their emissions and support emission reduction projects.  \n  \nBuyers, such as companies, governments, or individuals, purchase carbon credits to offset their own emissions and meet their sustainability goals. The carbon credits are transferred from the seller to the buyer, often facilitated through specialized platforms or exchanges. Carbon credits help the companies to minimize their greenhouse gas emissions.  \n  \nThe key players profiled in the carbon credits market report include South Pole, 3Degrees, EKI Energy Services Ltd, TerraPass, NATUREOFFICE, Moss.Earth, Climate Impact Partners, Carbon Credit Capital, LLC, CarbonBetter, and NativeEnergy.  \n  \nCarbon credits are generated through projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions. These projects can include renewable energy installations, energy efficiency improvements, methane capture from landfills or agricultural operations, reforestation and afforestation initiatives, and other activities that lead to a decrease in GHG emissions.  \n  \nCarbon credits work on the principle of \"offsetting\" emissions. When an entity, such as a company or individual, emits carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, they can purchase carbon credits equivalent to the amount of emissions they have produced. The money from the purchase goes towards funding emission reduction projects. By buying and retiring these credits, the entity is effectively offsetting their own emissions by supporting projects that reduce emissions elsewhere.  \n  \nEmission reduction projects often deliver co-benefits beyond GHG reductions. For example, renewable energy projects contribute to the transition to clean energy sources, create jobs, and improve air quality. Reforestation initiatives enhance biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Sustainable development principles are often integrated into the design and implementation of emission reduction projects to ensure they promote social, economic, and environmental benefits.  \n  \nIn order to meet the net-zero carbon emissions, it is necessary to lower greenhouse gas emissions to almost 50% by 2030 and to reduce to net zero by 200. Thus, purchasing carbon credits can help in addressing huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions.  \n  \nCarbon credits are basically the certificates that represents the amount of greenhouse gases removed from the atmosphere.  \n  \nBuy This Report (280 Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures): https://bit.ly/44HOP3I  \n  \nHere's how the process generally works:  \n  \nEmission Reduction Projects: Organizations or individuals can undertake projects that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These projects can be in various forms, such as renewable energy installations, reforestation efforts, energy efficiency improvements, or methane capture from landfills.  \n  \nVerification and Certification: Independent third-party organizations assess these projects to verify their emission reduction claims. Once the projects meet certain criteria and standards, they are certified, and the amount of emission reduction achieved is quantified in carbon credits.  \n  \nCarbon Credit Trading: These certified carbon credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets. Buyers are typically companies or individuals looking to offset their own emissions to meet carbon reduction targets or voluntary commitments.  \n  \nCarbon Offset: The buyer, by purchasing carbon credits, effectively offsets a corresponding amount of their own carbon emissions. This means that the overall carbon emissions in the atmosphere remain the same because the reduction achieved through the emission reduction project balances out the buyer's emissions.  \n  \nEnvironmental Benefits: The projects funded by carbon credit purchases have a positive environmental impact by reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.  \n  \nIn addition, participating in voluntary carbon credit markets enables companies to showcase climate leadership and demonstrate their commitment to addressing climate change. This involvement often goes beyond basic compliance requirements, as companies voluntarily take additional measures to reduce their emissions and support emission reduction projects.  \n  \nSuch initiatives can drive innovation in clean technologies and sustainable practices. These factors are anticipated to drive the carbon credits market forecast in the upcoming years.  \n  \nAn increase in the number of public and private organizations that help in achieving environmental sustainability by trading carbon credits is anticipated to boost the market demand during the forecast period.  \n  \nThe carbon credits market share is segmented on the basis of type, system, end-use industry, and region. By type, it is classified into regulatory and voluntary. By system, it is classified into cap-and-trade and baseline-and-credit. By end-use industry, it is classified into aviation, energy, industrial, petrochemical, and others.  \n  \nImpact of COVID-19  \n  \nThe carbon credits sector is largely monitored by the governments across several countries. The carbon credits market opportunities were hampered during the pandemic due to reduced investments on emission reduction projects such as carbon sustainability projects and renewable energy projects.  \n  \nRead More Information: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/carbon-credits-market-A107126  \n  \nThe carbon credits market was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to economic crisis across several countries, travel restrictions, closure of manufacturing units, and reduced energy consumption.  \n  \nSimilar Reports:-  \n  \nAdvanced Energy Market by Application (Electricity generation, Electricity Delivery & Management, Building Efficiency, Water Efficienecy, Transportation, Fuel Production & Delivery): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2030  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/advanced-energy-market-A15774  \n  \nAI in Energy Market By Component type (Solutions, Services), By Application (Robotics, Renewables Management, Demand Forecasting, Safety and Security, Infrastructure, Others), By End user (Energy Transmission, Energy Generation, Energy Distribution, Utilities), By Deployment Type (On-premise, Cloud): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2021-2031  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/ai-in-energy-market-A12587  \n  \nSmart Energy Market by Product (Smart grid, Digital Oilfield, Smart Solar, and Home energy management system), End-User Industry (Residential, Industrial, and Commercial): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2027  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/smart-energy-market-A09434  \n  \nDavid Correa5933 NE Win Sivers Drive#205, Portland, OR 97220United StatesUSA/Canada (Toll Free):+1-800-792-5285, +1-503-894-6022UK: +44-845-528-1300Hong Kong: +852-301-84916India (Pune): +91-20-66346060Fax: +1(855)550-5975help@alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nWeb: www.alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nAllied Market Research Blog:   \n  \nhttps://blog.alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nAllied Market Research (AMR) is a full-service market research and business-consulting wing of Allied Analytics LLP based in Portland, Oregon.

Bickel)\n\n\u201cThe more carbon you store from the atmosphere with your crops, and the more crops grown throughout the year, you offset some of your waste, your wasted energy,\u201d said Shalamar Armstrong, an associate professor of agronomy at Purdue University. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve stored carbon that would have been emitted (into) the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an area getting more attention from lawmakers, researchers and industry professionals.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced a $300 million investment to monitor agricultural emissions, including by creating a research network to monitor carbon in soil.\n\nAnd U.S. Sens. Tina Smith, D-Minn., and Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced a bill that Smith said would support the research needed to \u201cproperly credit soil carbon storage.\u201d\n\nThe USDA announcement and the legislation are both aimed at the difficult question of how to quantify carbon stored in soil.\n\nIt\u2019s an obstacle to overcome if the young and booming soil carbon market is to avoid the scrutiny, and skepticism, directed at carbon credit markets.\n\n![](https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/FmXha7sDEq8mRiT4jEi8p54U-Gs=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/RCQHUJ5BHNHOTFBDPZ65OM4SPU.jpg)Soil researcher Asmita Gautam (right) prepares a soil sample for carbon content analysis while talking with Shalamar Armstrong, associate professor of agronomy at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. (AP photo/Joshua A. Bickel)\n\n\u201cThe science piece (of carbon credits) has really lagged behind, particularly when it comes to things like monitoring, reporting and verification,\u201d said Cristel Zoebisch, deputy director of policy at climate organization Carbon180.\n\n\u201cThese are huge obstacles for not just soil carbon sequestration, but really any land-based carbon removal solution.\u201d\n\nArmstrong has been trying to help fix that problem. He runs a lab where researchers are investigating how farming management affects the amount of carbon in soil across different landscapes.\n\nHe and others at Purdue have been studying soil samples that date back more than 40 years, comparing different types of tilling and cover crops to determine their long-term effects on carbon storage.\n\nIt can take years of fieldwork, careful chemistry in the lab and lots of expensive equipment to puzzle that out.\n\nHe hopes his precise calculations will help farmers make decisions that allow them to receive worthwhile incentives for sequestering carbon while maintaining their existing profits.\n\n![](https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/mtv8iS8ED0qx5LAmTbJQ0Sic890=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/JWJAUMZQ2RB3NP6GAH4IMVP3PE.jpg)Shalamar Armstrong, associate professor of agronomy at Purdue University, holds a shovel full of soil in Fowler, Indiana. (AP photo/Joshua A. Bickel)\n\nBut other academics worry that even if farmers do get paid for storing soil carbon, it won\u2019t solve a bigger problem: that carbon markets often don\u2019t work.\n\nFor offsets to be legitimate, they have to meet four criteria. They have to store carbon that would otherwise be emitted; they have to be verifiable in data; they have to be immediate \u2014 planting a tree that might grow up in 20 years doesn\u2019t cut it; and they have to be long-lasting, said John Sterman, a professor of management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nBetter quantifying soil carbon storage through research might make the offsets more verifiable, but it doesn\u2019t address other factors.\n\nFor example, many farmers rent the land they work, and can\u2019t guarantee that carbon stored on their land will stay put in several decades if someone else is working the land.\n\nBarbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project at University of California, Berkeley, has worked on research that she said shows the effects of carbon offset projects are commonly overestimated, sometimes vastly so.\n\n\u201cCarbon trading is a mechanism that has failed miserably over the last 20 years that we really need to be moving away from,\u201d Haya said.\n\n![](https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/uo2Pdemj4Sffh24leIeNJNPLdSY=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/XC2CTQYGCZHY3LFFYE2PJQ7SQA.jpg)Soil researcher Asmita Gautam, a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, prepares a soil sample for carbon content analysis in West Lafayette, Indiana. (AP photo/Joshua A. Bickel)\n\nU.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., last month introduced a bipartisan bill to support farmers in improving soil health, with incentives that don\u2019t necessarily involve the carbon market.\n\nHe said farmers in his district have also described the benefits of regenerative practices, and that many would be interested in participating in carbon markets with \u201crobust\u201d accounting systems. But he added that those hoping for serious climate action shouldn\u2019t rely only on offsets.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s really not the silver bullet,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cI think offsets are inherently sketchy.\u201d\n\nSome farmers are moving cautiously.\n\nBrad Wetli, an Indiana farmer who collaborates with Armstrong, has been trying techniques that use less tilling and has been planting cover crops like rye for a few years now.\n\nHe\u2019s happy with the way his current fields look \u2014 \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re doing something\u201d to contribute to sustainability, he said \u2014 but he\u2019s still weighing his options with possible carbon credit contracts, doing the math and waiting to see whether the price will be right, since many offset agreements can last for several years.\n\n![](https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/x_tNILb5R-l-n47oQUjsSCGq6Z8=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/J3OANA6OHRC5PEEULIPPGY5PYI.jpg)Soil researcher Asmita Gautam, a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, prepares a soil sample for carbon content analysis in West Lafayette, Indiana.

With the current path of carbon emissions, grasslands will be the only viable net carbon dioxide sink through 2101.\n\n\n\"[G]rasslands store more carbon than forests because they are impacted less by droughts and wildfires,\u201d Pawlok Dass, the study's lead author, said in a statement. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t even include the potential benefits of good land management to help boost soil health and increase carbon stocks in rangelands.\u201d\n\n\nCertified measurement of regenerative practices can allow ranchers to sell carbon credits and diversify their revenue streams. Grassroots Carbon has dispersed over [$2 million in payments](https://grassrootscarbon.com/about-us/) to ranchers for regenerative land management since January 2022, and has a pool of over 20 carbon credit buyers.\n\n\nNestl\u00e9 has [expanded use of sustainable grazing](https://www.nestle.com/sustainability/nature-environment/regenerative-agriculture) within its dairy supply chain.

Photo: GettyImages \n\n\nThe notion of \u201c[degrowth](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/06/what-is-degrowth-economics-climate-change/)\u201d is gaining traction among some politicians in Europe. It was given a platform recently at the European Parliament\u2019s \u201c[Beyond Growth](https://www.beyond-growth-2023.eu/)\u201d conference.\n\n\nJason Hickel, an economic anthropologist and one of the [main advocates](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/23/developing-poor-countries-de-develop-rich-countries-sdgs) of degrowth, [defines](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14747731.2020.1812222?journalCode=rglo20) it as\n\n\n\n> \n> a planned reduction of energy and resource use designed to bring the economy back into balance with the living world in a way that reduces inequality and improves human wellbeing.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe [degrowth movement\u2019s](https://degrowth.info/degrowth) belief is that other approaches to the ecological crisis, such as [green growth](https://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/whatisgreengrowthandhowcanithelpdeliversustainabledevelopment.htm#:%7E:text=Green%20growth%20means%20fostering%20economic,which%20our%20well%2Dbeing%20relies.) and the [sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), are futile. That\u2019s because these approaches are rooted in [democratic capitalism](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-martin-wolf-issues-a-wakeup-call-on-the-state-of-democratic-capitalism), which is obsessed with economic growth.\n\n\nTherefore the movement [calls for](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00045608.2014.973803?journalCode=raag20) a \u201cradical political project\u201d that would displace capitalism and \u201cde-grow\u201d the west. The global south is exempt.\n\n\nSo far, the economic mainstream has been dismissive of degrowth, considering it perhaps not even worth engaging with. Critical analyses by [Ted Nordhaus](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/must-growth-doom-the-planet) and other leading economists such as [Branko Milanovic](https://degrowth.info/library/the-illusion-of-degrowth-in-a-poor-and-unequal-world) and [Andrew MacAfee](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-why-degrowth-is-the-worst-idea-on-the-planet/) remains confined to blog-style pieces.\n\n\nThe degrowth movement does, however, raise very valid criticisms against economic growth and the Green Growth paradigm that underpins the current mainstream approach to tackling the ecological crisis.\n\n\nBut do they offer valid solutions? Are the only two options facing us either ecological collapse or degrowth? Will degrowth save the world as Jason Hickel confidently [proclaims](https://www.jasonhickel.org/less-is-more)?\n\n\nIn several recent scholarly papers, published by the [IZA Institute of Labor Economics](https://www.iza.org/person/8708/wim-naude), I argue that the proposal for [degrowth is not a solution](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16139/melancholy-hues-the-futility-of-green-growth-and-degrowth-and-the-inevitability-of-societal-collapse) for the ecological crisis or for the shortcomings of democratic capitalism.\n\n\nDegrowth would be ineffective and might be even [worse for the environment](https://medium.com/@wimnaude/the-degrowth-movement-ecological-iatrogenics-6a7c2a54cf1b). Degrowth in industrialised countries would hit developing countries hard because of economic interdependencies.\n\n\nThe west has been experiencing [degrowth conditions](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16191/we-already-live-in-a-degrowth-world-and-we-do-not-like-it) (the \u201cgreat stagnation\u201d) for decades. This experiment has resulted in many social and political ills. The degrowth movement itself is a [reaction](https://illuminem.com/illuminemvoices/the-degrowth-movement-is-a-reaction-against-degrowth) against degrowth.\n\n\n### Flaws in the argument\n\n\n[Proponents of degrowth](https://degrowth.info/degrowth) argue that reducing the gross domestic product (GDP) of advanced economies would cut carbon emissions enough to avoid an ecological overshoot.\n\n\nBut my argument is that merely reducing the GDP of developed countries would have no significant impact on the world\u2019s overall material footprint.\n\n\n[Most](https://www.cgdev.org/media/developing-countries-are-responsible-63-percent-current-carbon-emissions) current carbon emissions (63%) come from developing countries where emissions will continue to increase. China, for example, is building the equivalent of [two](https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/china-permits-two-new-coal-power-plants-per-week-in-2022/) new coal-fired power plants every week.\n\n\nMany of the world\u2019s major carbon pollutors \u2014 fossil fuel companies \u2014 are located in the global south. They include Saudi Aramco, National Iranian Oil, Petroleos Mexicanos, PetroChina, Petroleos de Venezuela and Kuwait Petroleum.\n\n\nThey are also government owned or controlled, which makes it rather strange that Jason Hickel is advocating [nationalisation](https://twitter.com/jasonhickel/status/1330445163819380737) of fossil fuel companies as a degrowth-solution\u2026\n\n\nDegrowth considers the global south to be exempt from degrowth. This is an implicit acknowledgement that degrowth can do harm.\n\n\nThe movement has also [argued](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1057/s41301-023-00360-9?sharing_token=rW47li8tlUMeiCE_UD4KM1xOt48VBPO10Uv7D6sAgHv-DJSGIlutQg2eSUTMreNALHUql2pXjyM_N0mR30sNTJjmmQPBjmSkdFwNIqbJ-29qoVvqm0bQ4yMwghzbQ2kA9XztfHjrfrbAWFM2twf_oeEpn0-UxiwwaAZGc5K4Vn8=) that developed countries should compensate the global south. This implies giving a free pass to global south polluters whose fossil fuel rich governments will get trillions in reparation money to further invest in their polluting industries.\n\n\nDegrowth would also be ineffective. Most of its key proposals are likely to stimulate economic growth and consumption, not curtail it. For example, the degrowth movement calls for energy [sufficiency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620300165), basic income [grants](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2023-04-03-basic-income-grant-modelling-shows-how-to-do-it-as-a-boost-to-the-economy/) and [four-day](https://theconversation.com/five-reasons-why-the-four-day-week-wont-work-188188) working weeks. It proposes [banning](https://ontgroei.degrowth.net/policies-for-degrowth/) advertising.\n\n\nAll of these may be subject to [rebound effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622007685) \u2014 they would actually stimulate economic growth and materialisation of the economy.\n\n\nBut degrowth might not only be ineffective in reducing ecological overshoot. It might turn out to be [dirty](https://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/van-den-bergh_degrowth-and-a-growth.pdf).\n\n\nFirst, redistribution towards less developed countries, as degrowth proposes, would stimulate economic growth and aggregate consumption growth in developing countries. Strangely, although degrowthers reject [neoclassical economic growth theory](https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/development-theory/The-neoclassical-counterrevolution), they seem to adhere to its tenet that redistribution has no effect on economic growth.\n\n\nSecond, with reduced income, developed countries would have fewer resources to invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies. Degrowthers may counter that countries could just reallocate their expenditure away from conspicuous consumption towards such green investment.\n\n\nBut that would be inconsistent with the [fact](https://www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/2022/) that the [most innovative](https://www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/2022/) countries are not Jason Hickel\u2019s [poster-children](https://twitter.com/jasonhickel/status/1546844818772529159) such as Sri Lanka or Cuba, but those with the highest GDP, such as the USA and Switzerland. Innovation costs money.\n\n\nKate Raworth is therefore mistaken when she [claims](https://euobserver.com/growth-week/157013) that \u201cboundaries unleash creativity.\u201d\n\n\nWith resources and innovation under degrowth pressure, firms might simply [replace](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/degrowth-delusion/) expensive cleaner production techniques with cheaper, but more polluting ones. And without future growth, debt would contract, starving risky but necessary investment projects.\n\n\nThe upshot is that degrowth would leave the world more vulnerable to the impacts of ecological deterioration.\n\n\nDegrowth might also harm developing countries because of the intertwined nature of the global economy. This might disproportionately hurt the poorest of the poor \u2014 and make global inequality worse.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis emphasised this inter-dependency. Poverty rose more sharply in the global south than in the global north. The impact of the pandemic indicated how difficult it would be for the south to decouple from the north.\n\n\n### Degrowth and dictatorship\n\n\nBecause of these shortcomings, degrowth is politically [unfeasible](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22408556/save-planet-shrink-economy-degrowth). Democracy and degrowth are inherently uncomfortable bedfellows. The only example in history of a sustainable and thriving stationary (non-growing) society was Japan during the Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603-1868). It was, however, a \u201c[brutal dictatorship](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-29038-2)\u201d.\n\n\nGiven that a democracy is unlikely to choose degrowth voluntarily, the degrowth movement may set the west on a dangerous path towards rejecting democracy and reverting to an authoritarian collective.\n\n\nThe degrowth movement thinks that material use and carbon emissions cannot be decoupled from economic growth, but that innovation, creativity, happiness and social progress can. This ignores how much social progress has accompanied the last two centuries of economic growth.\n\n\nThe physicist Tom Murphy, who has stressed the [limits](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01652-6) to economic growth, has [warned](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2015/09/you-call-this-progress/) that\n\n\n\n> \n> In times of plenty, we can afford to be kind to those who are different. We are less threatened when we are comfortable. If our 21st Century standard of living peaks [\u2026] then we may not have the luxury of viewing our social progress as an irreversible ratchet. Hard times revive old tribal instincts: different is not welcome.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Ted Nordhaus as a Nobel Prize winner.

However, the guidelines\u00a0fall short in several areas \u2014\u00a0the assessment framework fails to meet robust requirements for a more meaningful and watertight carbon market.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) July 27, 2023 brought out its [core carbon principles](https://icvcm.org/the-core-carbon-principles/) (CCP), assessment framework and assessment procedure, replacing the draft published in March 2023.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Read more:**\u00a0[Decoding carbon markets: Role of intermediaries in the web of transactions](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/decoding-carbon-markets-role-of-intermediaries-in-the-web-of-transactions-88923)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nWith this release, the Integrity Council has also started [accepting applications](https://icvcm.org/assessment-platform/) from carbon-crediting programmes for the assessment of projects against the CCP.\n\n\nOver the years, [fraud and greenwashing allegations](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/irregularities-fraud-prompt-countries-to-tighten-grip-on-voluntary-offset-markets-89995) have significantly damaged the credibility and integrity of large-scale carbon offset projects that comprise the voluntary carbon market, affecting stakeholders who depend on these offsets and alarming observers of the ecosystem.\u00a0\n\n\nConsequently, a growing need has been felt to evaluate and regulate the voluntary offset markets.\u00a0\n\n\nICVCM was set up in 2021 to enforce standards that would benchmark \u2018credible\u2019 and \u2018high-integrity\u2019 carbon credits. It was a [successor to the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets](https://www.iif.com/Portals/1/Files/TSVCM_Public_Consultation.pdf), a body formed in 2020 by the United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action, Mark Carney.\u00a0\n\n\nThe CCP released by ICVCM has been designed to review carbon credit projects against principles that are often violated in the existing, structureless and unregulated voluntary carbon markets.\u00a0\n\n\nA checklist of measures\u00a0\u2014 broadly categorised under governance, emissions impact and sustainable development\u00a0\u2014 is provided by the framework. It assigned responsibilities to carbon-crediting programmes and mitigation activity proponents.\n\n\nBut a good part of the checklist hardly goes beyond what is already accepted as principles and requisites by the existing carbon-crediting programmes, such as Verra and Gold Standard, at least in theory.\n\n\nFor instance, a technical requirement in the framework mandates the inclusion of information such as the location of the project, proponents, applied technologies/practices, environmental and social impacts, methodology for baseline determination and quantification of greenhouse gas\u00a0emissions reductions or removals in the mitigation activity design document.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Read more:**\u00a0[Stripping carbon from the atmosphere might be needed to avoid dangerous warming \u2014 but it remains a deeply uncertain prospect](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/stripping-carbon-from-the-atmosphere-might-be-needed-to-avoid-dangerous-warming-but-it-remains-a-deeply-uncertain-prospect-86188)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nHowever, this information is [already required](https://verra.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/VCS-Standard-v4.4-FINAL.pdf) by several crediting programmes to be given by the mitigation activity proponents. But programmes often outmanoeuvre the rules and the ICVCM framework does little to help counter it. Take, for instance, a project providing an [outline map of India](https://registry.verra.org/mymodule/ProjectDoc/Project_ViewFile.asp?FileID=57705&IDKEY=niofj09234rm9oq4jndsma80vcalksdjf98cxkjaf90823nmq3f79575195) to specify that the [project is in the country.](https://registry.verra.org/mymodule/ProjectDoc/Project_ViewFile.asp?FileID=51505&IDKEY=s98klasmf8jflkasf8098afnasfkj98f0a9sfsakjflsakjf8ds71025395)\n\n\nSimilarly, the framework did not state requirements for establishing additionality any differently than what has been considered by crediting programmes. Proponents have been able to [game the additionality requirement](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/decoding-carbon-markets-role-of-intermediaries-in-the-web-of-transactions-88923) by following the letter of the law. ICVCM\u2019s proposition on additionality would only further the malpractice.\n\n\nThe framework also did not address conflicts of interest existing in the system. For instance, with respect to third-party independent validation and verification (VVB), the terms of engagement and transparency in relations with activity proponents remain unaddressed.\n\n\nThe responsibility to assess [environmental and social risks](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/irregularities-fraud-prompt-countries-to-tighten-grip-on-voluntary-offset-markets-89995) has largely been placed on the project proponents such as by mentioning negative impacts of mitigation activity on terrestrial and marine biodiversity, etc. in the design document.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, this holds little value unless a third party performs an independent check for environmental and social risks. VVBs have proved insufficient to assess and flag such risks.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Read more:**\u00a0[G7 sets renewables target, no timeline for fossil fuel phase out](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/g7-sets-renewables-target-no-timeline-for-fossil-fuel-phase-out-88821)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThere are some welcome specifications in the framework, including the requirement for registries to compulsorily include information such as on whose behalf the [credits are being retired and by whom](https://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CMW-briefing-on-intermediaries.pdf) and the consideration of government policies and legal requirements when specifying baseline emissions.\u00a0\n\n\nThe framework also excludes ex-ante credits that are issued before the emission is actually reduced from receiving CCP labels.\n\n\nOne of the key components is the benefit-sharing aspect of carbon credits, where communities and indigenous groups are involved and there is almost always very little information available in the public domain. \n\n\nThe ICVCM framework requires activity proponents to include information on benefit sharing in the design document.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, it does not specifically ask the proponent to clarify ownership of carbon rights and the sharing of monetary benefits from the sale of credit. In several cases, benefit sharing is described subjectively by proponents who avoid objectively describing exactly what has been the benefit to the community.\n\n\nOne of the leading carbon credit programmes, Verra, was quick to issue a [public statement](https://verra.org/verra-welcomes-new-icvcm-criteria/) welcoming the new assessment criteria and reworking its existing programme for carbon credits by August 2023. \n\n\nWhen the draft of the core carbon principles was released last year, Verra raised concerns about the [extensive assessment procedures](https://verra.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Part-3-SDM-Verra_Web.pdf) outlined in the framework.\u00a0\n\n\nIn March 2023, Verra welcomed the framework but also declared its intentions to conduct a thorough review of both the principles and the framework. Meanwhile, the [Gold Standard expressed its belief](https://twitter.com/goldstandard/status/1641425662467624960?s=61&t=t1i9dbVGCNj494xbZQb3oA) that the principles fail to elevate the level of ambition or quality.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Read more:**\u00a0[Voluntary carbon market governance body proposes regulations to stamp out greenwashing](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/voluntary-carbon-market-governance-body-proposes-regulations-to-stamp-out-greenwashing-88676)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe Gold Standard has yet to issue a statement on the latest iteration of the framework.\n\n\nThe framework has been much anticipated by buyers eager to avoid the pitfalls of greenwashing as well as by sellers who wish to restore public trust in the voluntary carbon market.\u00a0However, it seems to water down the checks that enforce core carbon principles, likely to increase acceptability among carbon credit programmes.\n\n\nInstead of having a plethora of integrity principles, frameworks and labels, what is necessary to restore public trust in the market is the efficient implementation of rules, possibly with government support.\n\n\n\n [\u091c\u0932\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0941\u00a0\u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/climate-change)  \n \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0916\u092c\u0930\u0947\u0902 [\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory) \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0922\u093c\u0947\u0902\u0964\n\n\n[Carbon Market](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/carbon-market)\n[Carbon Credit](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/carbon-credit)\n[Carbon Offset](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/carbon-offset) \n[Carbon budget](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/carbon-budget)\n[Carbon credits](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/carbon-credits)\n[carbon neutral goal](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/carbon-neutral-goal)\n[Carbon dioxide emissions](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/carbon-dioxide-emissions)\n[net zero goal](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/net-zero-goal)\n[greenwashing](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/greenwashing)\n[Global Warming](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/global-warming)\n[Climate Change](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/climate-change)\n[World](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/tag/world)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Daily Newsletter : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SUPPORT US ![](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate (1).png)](https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

But this time, the standard-setter is putting more meat on the bones of its plan to bring credibility to carbon offsets \u2014 a plan that promises a deep dive into the murky issues clouding the market\u2019s reputation and one that\u2019s sure to come with pitfalls of its own.\n\nThe Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market [on Thursday released the criteria](https://icvcm.org/assessment-framework/) it will use to assess whether carbon crediting programs \u2014 as well as individual categories of projects, like forestry or cookstove replacement projects \u2014 meet the group\u2019s \u201cCore Carbon Principles\u201d and, therefore, whether they can be labeled as such.\n\nThe effort is likely the best hope for restoring the market\u2019s battered reputation, which has been keeping offset prices low and scaring away corporate customers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real lack of consistent quality, and that\u2019s been a significant challenge and a problem for the market,\u201d said **Nat Keohane**, a senior adviser to ICVCM and the president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking to do is create a signal for quality that not only helps buyers today, but also pushes the market toward high integrity by creating incentives.\u201d\n\nKeohane said he expects the market will embrace and adopt the ICVCM\u2019s assessment framework\u2019s key criteria, which include principles of additionality, permanence and conservative accounting of the emissions impact.\n\nNow the actual standard-setting begins. Two working groups are forming: one to make recommendations on which categories of projects should be \u201cfast-tracked\u201d for approval and which should not, and another that will assess the categories that \u201craise more complex issues.\u201d\n\nObvious questions emerge: Even if the entire category of forestry projects, for instance, is deemed CCP-friendly, there\u2019s inevitable variability between projects within the same category. Because ICVCM isn\u2019t a regulator, Keohane said, the best the body can do is promote \u201chigh levels of quality across the market.\u201d The group is aiming to start assessing programs and project categories by the end of the year.\n\nEnvironmental watchdogs are hopeful but moderating their expectations.\n\n\u201cThe coming months will be the ICVCM\u2019s most important test so far,\u201d said **Gilles Dufrasne**, policy lead on global carbon markets at Carbon Market Watch, a nonprofit. \u201cWe will see how far it is willing to go to exclude problematic activities from eligibility under its label.\u201d\n\n*Starting next Tuesday, the Long Game\u2019s format moves to weekly.

What could be simpler?\n\n\nRishi Sunak's Conservative Party is [languishing in the national polls](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/) as an election looms next year. But the U.K. prime minister has [seized on a recent by-election victory](https://www.politico.eu/article/green-campaigners-fear-uk-policy-backlash-ulez-uxbridge-tory-by-election-boris-johnson/) to side with drivers against government environmental action, and enraged green groups by pressing ahead with a [plan to allow more oil and gas drilling](https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-oil-gas-licenses-north-sea/) in the North Sea.\n\n\nAt the same time, Sunak is standing behind an ambitious \u2014 and legally-binding \u2014 Conservative pledge to cut carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot everyone in his party \u2014 which has vocal caucuses with opposing takes on climate policy \u2014\u00a0is convinced he can keep walking that tightrope.\n\n \n### \n \n You may like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The British public\u2019s mounting food price anxiety](https://www.politico.eu/article/british-public-anxiety-food-price-inflation-impact-election-conservative/)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Liv Walsham](https://www.politico.eu/author/liv-walsham/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[China found influence in Europe\u2019s west \u2014 not east](https://www.politico.eu/article/china-found-influence-in-europes-west-not-east/)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Andreea Brinza](https://www.politico.eu/author/andreea-brinza/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Michel Barnier calls for post-Brexit UK-EU defense treaty](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-uk-defense-brexit-michel-barnier-foreign-policy-treaty/)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Sebastian Whale](https://www.politico.eu/author/sebastian-whale/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### The Uxbridge factor\n\n\nThe symbolic shift has its roots in Uxbridge, a west London constituency the Tories had been tipped to lose in a recent by-election.\n\n\nBut the governing party snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, tapping into local anger about the Labour mayor of London\u2019s plan to expand the city's ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) which levies charges on high-polluting vehicles.\n\n\nSome Tory strategists now think they've spotted an opening. Sunak himself has already responded to Uxbridge with hints that some targets on the way to 2050 could be watered down. He has [declared himself](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/07/29/rishi-sunak-on-motorists-side-review-anti-car-policies/) \u201con the side of motorists.\u201d\n\n\nSunak is not going to roll back the green agenda wholesale, the thinking goes. Instead, the aim is to court votes and open up a dividing line with Labour where environmental protection intersects with the cost of living. \n\n\nClimate policies, including moves to reduce U.K. net carbon emissions to zero by 2050, are [relatively popular](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/li3arml6jo/TheTimes_NetZero_230726.pdf) across the political spectrum \u2014 but voters harbor concerns on the specifics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the government position is framed as being \u2018anti-green\u2019 that's not likely to work, because the public do recognize the importance of climate change,\u201d explains Keiran Pedley of polling company Ipsos. \u201cIf it is framed within the context of the cost of living it has more potential to resonate.\u201d\n\n\nRobert Goodwill, a Conservative MP who chairs the environment select committee says \u201cIt\u2019s not abandoning our climate change promises\u201d to recognize that \u201cthe burden of addressing climate change seems to be falling on those least able to pay.\"\n\n\nGoodwill adds that Sunak\u2019s recent show of support for motorists will be welcomed in rural seats like his, where public transport is unreliable and people\u2019s jobs depend on cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n[All](#) \n[3 Years](#) \n[2 Years](#) \n[1 Year](#) \n[6 Months](#) \n\n\n[Smooth](#)\n[Kalman](#)\n\n\nLiz Truss new PMRishi Sunak new PMJul 31, 2023Con26 %Lab46 %Lib Dems11 %UKIP1 %Greens5 %SNP3 %Reform6 %ChangeUKPlaid1 %SepOctNovDec2023FebMarAprMayJunJulAug0 %5 %10 %15 %20 %25 %30 %35 %40 %45 %50 %55 %\n*For more polling data from across Europe visit* [POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/) *[Poll of Polls](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/).*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA former Tory election strategist, granted anonymity to speak candidly about possible planning inside the party, warns that \u201cgeneric retreat on net-zero isn\u2019t going to work\u201d but believes there is nonetheless mileage in \u201chammering [the message] that when you get Labour politicians they massively put up the cost of driving \u2014 just look at Sadiq Khan.\u201d\n\n\nOne Cabinet minister confirmed this was part of the government\u2019s thinking. They said they were personally committed to net-zero but that they spied \u201cpolitical space\u201d wherever \"Labour strays into becoming doctrinaire about it.\u201d This, they said, was exactly what Labour had done with ULEZ.\u00a0\n\n\n### Style over substance?\n\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 change of direction is mainly a presentational one, according to Jack Richardson, head of environment and energy at right-of-center think tank Onward. \u201cThere\u2019s undoubtedly a shift in the vibes coming out of government \u2014 we're hearing more about oil and less about renewables. But in terms of policy little has changed,\u201d Richardson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly, while Sunak has tinkered with a few deadlines in recent days \u2014 including ditching a 2028 target for ensuring rented properties are more energy efficient \u2014 big chunks of the net-zero agenda are unchanged.\n\n\nA ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 remains in place, as does a 2025 *de facto* ban on gas boilers in newbuild homes and a 2035 carbon-free electricity target. The granting of new oil and gas licenses and carbon capture rollout were announced this week in line with longstanding plans.\u00a0\n\n\nYet the partial wobble has been enough to draw the ire of some green Conservatives, who believe any backpedaling is both morally wrong and likely to lose them votes at the next election.\n\n\n![](https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01/GettyImages-1569100290-1024x683.jpg)Sunak plays during a visit to the Great British Beer Festival | Pool photo by Daniel Leal via Getty Images\nSunak faces pressure from climate moderates inside his own party, unconvinced there is a real political or moral upside to signaling a shift away from the agenda.\n\n\nFormer Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith told POLITICO: \u201cRejection of ULEZ has come to be seen as a rejection of all green policies and there is zero evidence for that.\"\n\n\nFormer energy minister Chris Skidmore [called](https://twitter.com/CSkidmoreUK/status/1685948524033130498) this week's granting of fossil fuel licenses \u201cthe wrong decision at the wrong time\" and warned Sunak he risked being on the \"wrong side of history.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Policy appeal\n\n\nNo. 10 is acutely aware of the strong feelings on net-zero among Tory backbenchers on both sides.

[The news stems from a licensing round [held in October](https://t.co/hD9sqMnwae) and is still subject to final approvals from the regulator.] Sunak also indicated he would approve the UK\u2019s \u201clargest untapped reserves\u201d in the Rosebank field, which hold 500m barrels of oil, the paper says. Sunak\u00a0 \u201cinsisted the plan was compatible with net-zero commitments given the anticipated part-reliance on fossil fuels for years to come, saying it was more carbon-intensive to ship oil and gas from other countries\u201d, it adds. According to the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis), Sunak told broadcasters that \u201cdomestic supplies were significantly more efficient than shipping gas and oil from other countries\u201d.

The North Sea Transition Authority is expected to grant the first licence in the autumn, [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-oil-gas-licenses-north-sea/) says.\u00a0\n\n\nThe [Press Association](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/rishi-sunak-north-sea-oil-b2384799.html) reports that Sunak also announced up to \u00a320bn funding for carbon capture and storage projects. [This figure was first [mentioned](https://www.carbonbrief.org/uk-spring-budget-2023-key-climate-and-energy-announcements/) in the spring budget and cannot proceed without legislation setting out where the money will come from.] Separately, the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-net-zero-2050-b2384753.html) says: \u201cThe government believes the carbon capture and storage industry could support 50,000 jobs in Britain by 2030. Sunak said the carbon capture and storage industry would play a \u2018crucial\u2019 role in Britain\u2019s energy transition. But critics fear the technology will be used by the oil and gas industry as an excuse to slow the transition away from fossil fuels.\u201d [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-heads-to-scotland-for-net-zero-energy-policy-push-12930459) says the two new sites \u2013 the Acorn carbon capture project in North East Scotland and the Viking project in the Humber \u2013 are not due to be up and running until 2030. \u201cThe government is targeting 20-30m tonnes of carbon capture per year by the end of the decade, and considers the process fundamental to its net-zero ambitions,\u201d [CityAM](https://www.cityam.com/government-backs-carbon-capture-and-storage-to-meet-net-zero-goals-and-boost-north-sea-industry/) reports.

However, it notes that the industry is still in \u201crelative infancy\u201d with all CCS projects worldwide only capturing around 40m tonnes of CO2 per year \u2013 equivalent to 10% of the UK\u2019s annual emissions.\n\n\nSunak\u2019s announcement \u201cdrew immediate backlash from opposition figures, the renewable energy industry, scientists and climate groups along with former Conservative ministers,\u201d the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/rishi-sunak-north-sea-oil-b2384817.html) reports. The paper quotes a critical [tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacGoldsmith/status/1685710759576174593) by former climate minister Zac Goldsmith, adding that former energy minister Chris Skidmore [called](https://twitter.com/CSkidmoreUK/status/1685948524033130498) the announcement \u201cthe wrong decision at precisely the wrong time\u201d. The [i newspaper](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/north-sea-oil-drilling-rishi-sunak-wrong-side-histor-2515800) also quotes Skidmore.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/business/britain-drilling-north-sea.html) says: \u201cThe announcements were an indication that the North Sea oil and gas industry is becoming an important battleground for Britain\u2019s next general election, in 2024.\u201d\n\n\nThe [Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/relaxation-of-net-zero-could-cause-meltdown-rishi-sunak-warned-ktdjjrg0s) reports that \u201cmore than 600 scientists and academics have written to Sunak for a second time, after being ignored in March, reiterating their call for him to commit to blocking new approvals [for oil and gas licences]\u201d. The newspaper quotes the letter: \u201cWith searing heat around the world reminding us of the very real danger posed by climate change, we are even more disappointed that the government\u2019s revised Net Zero Strategy did not rule out any new development of onshore and offshore oil and gas fields.\u201d [CityAM](https://www.cityam.com/labour-slams-rishi-sunaks-plans-to-boost-north-sea-oil-and-gas/) quotes shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband, who says Sunak\u2019s energy policies are \u201cweak and confused\u201d and will \u201cnot take a penny off bills\u201d. [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2385452-what-will-the-uk-push-for-more-north-sea-oil-and-gas-really-achieve/?utm_campaign=RSS%7CNSNS&utm_source=NSNS&utm_medium=RSS&utm_content=home) notes that according to the International Energy Agency, new oil and gas development is incompatible with global goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Meanwhile, [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-pausing-u-k-green-investment/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication) reports that \u201can Australian billionaire says he may step back from investing in UK green technologies after the government announced new backing for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.\u201d [CityAM](https://www.cityam.com/trade-bodies-back-governments-embrace-of-north-sea-oil-and-gas-industry/) reports that \u201ctrade bodies\u201d have welcomed Sunak\u2019s announcement, in a piece quoting only one trade body, Offshore Energies UK, the voice of the North Sea oil and gas industry.\n\n\nMeanwhile, analysis from the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/new-oil-gas-licences-rishi-sunak-un-climate-crisis) says: \u201cGrant Shapps, the energy security and net-zero secretary, said: \u2018New oil and gas licences will drive forward our energy independence and our economy for generations\u2026safeguarding energy bills for British families.\u2019 These claims are simply wrong. The UK is more hooked than most on gas and has the high bills to prove it. Real energy security comes from using less gas. In any case, new UK fields are unlikely to deliver for many years and would be a mere drop in the global oil and gas ocean, having no impact on prices\u2026If Sunak were really interested in freeing the UK from the influence of \u2018hostile states\u2019 and Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u2018weaponised energy\u2019, which drive the extreme volatility of oil and gas prices, he would be pushing hard on the policies that could free the nation from fossil fuel addiction. These include the cheapest of all power, onshore wind, which Sunak continues to block\u2026Shapps claims that Labour\u2019s energy and climate plans are \u2018an existential threat to our national energy security\u2019. In contrast, analysis by the climate website [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-would-need-less-imported-gas-under-a-labour-government) shows that Labour\u2019s plans, including ending new oil and gas licences, would result in less imported gas, thanks to a push on renewables\u2026 Sunak also backed two new carbon capture and storage facilities, where CO2 from gas burning could be captured and buried. CCS will have a small but important role in cutting industrial emissions but, as the IPCC found, renewable energy is by far the bigger and cheaper opportunity.\u201d\n\n\nElsewhere, the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/31/sunak-private-jet-scotland-aberdeen-ministerial-code-labour) reports: \u201cLabour has asked Rishi Sunak to explain why he used an RAF jet to fly to Scotland on Monday when scheduled flights were available, given the ministerial code says private planes should only be used when there is no alternative.\u201d The [Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/07/31/rishi-sunak-defends-using-private-jets-travel-around-uk/) says Sunak is defending his use of private jets to travel around the UK, saying it is the most \u201cefficient\u201d use of his time, and adding that \u201cban[ning] everything\u201d is \u201cabsolutely the wrong approach\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**China\u2019s heavy rain red alert: The Ministry of Water Resources has initiated a level II emergency response for flood control**\n\n\n People\u2019s Daily [Read Article](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0731/c1004-40047390.html)\n\n\n\nAccording to the China Meteorological Administration, it is predicted that in the next three days, certain areas in northern China will face a \u201chigh risk of heavy rain disasters\u201d, reports the People\u2019s Daily.

The city recorded 31 days in a row with temperatures above 110F this summer, breaking the previous record of 18 straight days that was set in 1974, the newspaper says.

Announcements regarding carbon capture and storage (CCS), the editorial continues, while, \u201cpartly designed to show that the government continues to treat its clean technology and net-zero targets seriously\u201d are \u201cmarginal initiatives\u201d that amount to \u201cletting energy companies off the hook\u201d. An editorial in the [Daily Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-more-interested-creating-30597928) says: \u201cRishi Sunak is more interested in creating culture wars than battling climate crisis\u201d.\n\n\nAn editorial in the [Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on-north-sea-licences-energy-security-vq30gg3f6) says plans for more oil and gas drilling in the North Sea are \u201ca sensible step\u201d which \u201cwill not prevent the attainment of the legal target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\u201d. [In 2021, the world\u2019s most influential energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, said there was no room for new oil and gas expansion anywhere in the world if the global energy system is to reach net-zero by 2050.] A [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12358721/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Watchdog-bares-fangs-dodgy-lawyers.html) editorial says: \u201cThe fact Labour and other eco-zealots are up in arms with the government for issuing hundreds of new North Sea oil and gas drilling licences proves it is a smart move. The reality is that green technology might well be the future, but while it\u2019s under development it can\u2019t be the only option.\u201d An editorial in the [Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23272423/rishi-sunak-net-zero-key-demands/) uses Rishi Sunak\u2019s North Sea announcement to continue its campaign against the 2030 petrol car ban, setting out \u201cfive key demands\u201d. A second [Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23272423/rishi-sunak-net-zero-key-demands/) editorial welcomes the new oil and gas licences. Meanwhile the [Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunaks-vow-to-drill-for-oil-and-gas-lights-up-explorers-chgwx5ndc) market reporter, Jessica Newman reports rising share prices for Shell, BP and Ithaca, among others, writing: \u201cAlmost as soon as the government had committed to awarding hundreds of new oil and gas drilling licences in the North Sea, London\u2019s investors rushed to get on board.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSeveral editorials link Sunak\u2019s announcement of more than a hundred new oil and gas licences in the North Sea with the recent Uxbridge by-election. The [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/rishi-sunak-gamble-environment-climate-change-oil-gas-licences-b1097824.html) writes: \u201cRishi Sunak and the Conservative Party appear to have concluded, on the basis of a solitary and surprise by-election victory, to trash the government\u2019s record on the environment. It is a curious decision \u2013 and one that threatens not only Britain\u2019s ability to combat catastrophic climate change, but also ignores the far more nuanced views of voters up and down the country.\u201d An editorial in the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/rishi-sunak-green-oil-gas-climate-b2385008.html) writes: \u201cThe PM is taking all the wrong lessons from his narrow squeak of a win at the Uxbridge by-election, and is posturing as the protector of hard-pressed families against the supposed excesses of environmentalism. In doing so, he is playing a dangerous game.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/dac34f85-0422-4d94-b35b-01582949c8f8) Lex column identifies that the fledgling CCS industry has \u201csuffered many false starts over the past 16 years\u201d. Thanks in part to Sunak\u2019s announcement yesterday, it writes, the industry is \u201cgaining momentum in the UK\u201d, but warns \u201cmany hurdles remain.\u201d In an editorial on \u201cthe government\u2019s assault on net zero\u201d, [BusinessGreen](https://www.businessgreen.com/blog-post/4121248/governments-assault-net-zero-triggered-battle-wins) editor James Murray, writes: \u201c[I]f these [CCS] projects are so critical to achieving net zero why has the government spent over a decade failing to deliver a functioning carbon capture project in the UK? Why is the expanding pipeline of new projects still waiting on clarity on the regulatory and subsidy framework in which they will operate? And does the government really think it can build this industry with just \u00a320bn of funding over 20 years, especially when it has just moved to reduce the cost of carbon?\u201d Murray also cautions readers against jumping too readily to conclusions: \u201cIf you look beyond all the spin of the past few days, the government has repeatedly reiterated its commitment to meeting the UK\u2019s net-zero goals and in the past month alone announced new measures to boost investment in nuclear, EV batteries and now carbon capture and storage projects\u2026it was notable to see Sunak refusing to budge on the target date for phasing out petrol and diesel cars. Decarbonisation will continue and the clean tech roll out will keep on accelerating, regardless of the increasingly vocal noises off.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe [Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2023/08/01/reviving-north-sea-oil-and-gas/) questions the tenability of Sunak\u2019s proposals on CCS, writing in an editorial: \u201cWill any of this actually happen? Carbon capture and storage technology has been available for decades, yet no government has taken it up because it is expensive\u2026Above all, which energy companies are going to invest in the North Sea if a Labour government is going to shut them down?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nOn their comment pages, the UK\u2019s right-leaning papers continue to give space to attacks on climate policy, with the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12358755/Incredible-Rishi-Sunak-leader-NOT-planning-rely-oil-gas-imported-nasty-dictators-writes-DANIEL-HANNAN.html) hosting climate-sceptic commentator Daniel Hannan, who writes: \u201cVirtue-signalling doesn\u2019t get more pointless than the idea that we should halt the extraction of oil and gas here, even if that means importing it from overseas at higher environmental cost.\u201d [An analysis published in 2022 found that, on average, UK production in the North Sea was nearly three times more emissions intensive than Norwegian production \u2013 the country the UK currently sources most of its oil and gas from \u2013 and has become more emissions intensive in recent years.]\u00a0The [Daily Express](https://www.pressreader.com/uk/daily-express/20230801/281741273925682/textview) political editor, Sam Lister, writes: \u201cEither we invest in our own [fossil fuels] or we import them.\u201d Also in the [Daily Express](https://www.pressreader.com/uk/daily-express/20230801/281741273925682/textview), political commentator Stephen Pollard writes: \u201cIf we refuse to use North Sea oil and gas anymore, we have to import it from somewhere else.\u201d [Once a licence is awarded, North Sea oil and gas belongs to the licence holder. These are mostly multinational or state-owned fossil fuel companies, including firms fully or partly owned by the Russian, Iranian, Chinese, Norwegian and other governments. Around 80% of oil produced in UK waters is currently exported. Similarly, during the global energy crisis last year, UK gas exports rose.] [Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/07/31/starmer-to-be-humiliated-by-global-retreat-from-net-zero/) columnist Sherelle Jacobs writes under the headline: \u201cStarmer is about to be humiliated by the global retreat from net-zero.\u201d She suggests the \u201ctide is turning on net-zero\u201d around the world.

Wolmar says: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. There is precious little blood to be drawn in LTNs. This is a niche concern, affecting a very small percentage of the population, of whom only a minority are opposed.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt is a measure of Rishi Sunak\u2019s desperation that he has been sucked into the battle over the \u2018war on motorists\u2019. There is, of course, no war on motorists. It is an invention of the Daily Mail and other rightwing newspapers that argue against any restriction on the freedom of motorists to act exactly as they wish.\u201d Opposition leader Keir Starmer \u201cshould sit on his hands and watch as the prime minister launches himself into a war he cannot win\u201d, Wolmar says. Elsewhere, associate editor of the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rishi-sunak-drivers-ulez-culture-wars-b2384898.html), Sean O\u2019Grady, has penned a comment piece on \u201chow motorists became the new front in Sunak\u2019s culture wars\u201d.

Researchers use remote-sensing data to determine how 20 different ecological variables, such as plant productivity and soil fertility, change in response to changes in grazing pressure and aridity. They find that increased pressure from grazing lowers most ecosystems\u2019 aridity threshold, \u201cshowing how ecological thresholds can be amplified by the joint effects\u201d of grazing pressure and climate change. They also find that almost 9% of current grazing areas are exceeding their \u201cmaximum allowable grazing pressure\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Other Stories.\n\n\n\n\n[![The

The company has placed sustainability at the heart of its long-term strategy, including investing in renewables, building a global hydrogen value chain and deploying innovative climate technology solutions.\n\n\nIn 2022, ADNOC\u2019s upstream carbon intensity performance was approximately 7 kgCO2e/boe as it responsibly contributed to meeting growing global energy demand. Furthermore, its industry leading methane intensity was approximately 0.07%, and the company was awarded the Gold Standard Pathway by the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0.\n\n\nAdditionally, in 2022 ADNOC achieved greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions of roughly 4mt by using grid energy from solar and nuclear power to supply 100% of its onshore operations as well as about 1mt from energy efficiency and flaring reduction projects. These results, independently assured by DNV, place ADNOC in the top tier of lowest carbon intensity oil and gas producers in the world.\n\n\nADNOC is a key enabler of the UAE\u2019s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which raises the ambition of the UAE\u2019s nationwide emissions reduction ambition to 40% by 2030. The company is also playing an important role in supporting the UAE\u2019s recently updated Energy Strategy 2050, its new National Hydrogen Strategy and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Climate Change Strategy.\n\n\nADNOC\u2019s commitment to sustainability and decarbonization dates back to the company\u2019s founding. Building on billions of dollars of investments in decarbonization and sustainability projects since its inception, ADNOC recently made an initial allocation of $15 billion to expedite the implementation of its key decarbonization initiatives, including carbon capture and storage, electrification, energy efficiency and nature-based solutions. Over the coming months, ADNOC will announce further investments and associated projects that will enable it to meet its updated ambitious decarbonization targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nADNOC will drive the global growth of renewable energy and green hydrogen through its shareholding in the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar). Masdar is a leading renewable energy company, targeting a portfolio of more than 100 GW of renewable capacity and the production of 1 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.\n\n\nADNOC\u2019s decarbonization plan includes a $3.8 billion, first-of-its-kind at scale, project connecting its offshore operations to clean grid power, which will reduce its offshore carbon footprint by up to 50%. It also includes building a 1 million tonnes per annum low-carbon ammonia production facility to help ADNOC\u2019s customers decarbonize.\n\n\nThis year, ADNOC started two pilot projects to deploy leading climate technologies to capture and permanently store carbon dioxide (CO2) as part of its plan to expand its carbon capture capacity to 5 million tonnes per annum by 2030.\n\n\nFor over 50 years, ADNOC has led the industry in eliminating routine flaring and has deployed leading technologies, advanced monitoring and industry-leading practices to substantially reduce methane emissions across its operations.\n\n\nLast year, ADNOC established a Low Carbon Solutions and International Growth Directorate to identify opportunities and drive forward its decarbonization plans, building off the company\u2019s successful track record of responsibly and reliably supplying energy to the world.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "ADNOC is accelerating its decarbonization plan, bringing

The company has committed to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its value chain by 2050 \u2013 the most ambitious commitment available through the SBTi process. Of the 2,000+ companies globally with a public net-zero pledge, it is among the first 300 companies to have its target validated by the SBTi.The company, headquartered in Switzerland, recently celebrated 170 years of operations. It has set a new series of near and long-term science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi, committing to reach net-zero \u2013 the point at which a balance is achieved between emissions produced and emissions taken from the atmosphere \u2013 by 2050. These targets are significantly more ambitious than the company\u2019s previous GHG reduction targets, approved by the SBTi in 2018 and 2020. The move sees SIG look beyond its own operations and commit to the decarbonisation of its full value chain in line with climate science. New near-term 2030 commitments (using 2020 as the baseline year) include: \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a042% absolute reduction of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0100% renewable electricity through 2030\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a051.6% reduction of scope 3 GHG emissions per litre packed SIG\u2019s new long-term 2050 targets include:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a090% absolute reduction of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a097% reduction of scope 3 GHG emissions per litre packedSamuel Sigrist, CEO at SIG, said, \u201cThe approval of our Net-Zero pathway by the SBTi is a milestone achievement that showcases our dedication to decarbonizing our operations and value chain.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the vast majority of GHG emissions within the real estate sector, but smaller amounts of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases are also emitted through activities such as air conditioning.\n \n\n\n Emissions are categorised into Scope 1,2 and 3:\n \n\n* Scope 1 is direct and controlled emissions from activities\n* Scope 2 is indirect emissions from electricity, heat or steam purchased and used\n* Scope 3 is all other indirect emissions outside of ownership or control, such as purchased products and services. Owing to the complexity of Scope 3 emissions, reporting remains limited, usually to business travel.\n\n\n Broadly, GHG emissions accounting steps include:\n \n\n* Confirm reporting boundaries and categories\n* Data collection\n* Data checks and analysis, addressing gaps and anomalies\n* GHG emissions calculation\n* Disclose GHG report\n\n\n Various regulatory compliance and voluntary initiatives govern GHG emissions calculations and inventories, which include:\n \n\n**GHG Protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard**\n\n\n This standard provides comprehensive and detailed sector-specific guidance and calculation methods to develop corporate-level GHG emissions inventories. Its purpose is to ensure that calculations represent a faithful, true and fair account of a company's emissions, by being relevant, complete, consistent, transparent and accurate.\n \n\n**ISO 14064**\n\n\n Based upon the same principles as the GHG Protocol, but more generic and concise, ISO 14064 establishes minimum standards for GHG quantification, monitoring, reporting, and verification. Both standards are compatible and complementary; you can use the GHG Protocol to identify and calculate your GHG emissions and removals and use the ISO 14064 to report and verify them.\n \n\n**Streamlined energy and carbon reporting (SECR)**\n\nSECR policy came into force on 1 April 2019, and requires companies in scope to report on their energy consumption and associated GHG emissions within their annual Directors' Report. This legislation supports the UK Government's plans to cut emissions by 78 per cent by 2035 and encourages businesses to quantify and reduce energy consumption in a more consistent and comparable manner.\n \n\n**Carbon disclosure project (CDP)**\n\n\n The CDP, previously known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, runs a global environmental disclosure system supporting companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their risks and opportunities on climate change, water security and deforestation. CDP takes the information supplied in its annual reporting process and publicly scores companies on their performance.\n \n\n**Science-based targets (SBT)**\n\n\n The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) provides companies with guidance and verification to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, to limit warming to less than 1.5\u00b0C / 2\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. This aims to prevent the worst impacts of climate change and future-proof business growth.

The government is currently considering policies to decarbonise the UK shipping sector but has yet to make any solid commitments.\n\n\nAt the level of the International Maritime Organization, the UK has endorsed a goal-based maritime emissions reduction pathway called the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). To meet the SBTi pathway will require large-scale use of zero-emission marine fuels and energy.\n\n\nIn March 2023, the UK government published assumptions for how much low-carbon shipping fuel will be required in 2035 to stay within the carbon budgets.\u00a0\n\n\nT&E calculated that meeting these assumptions with a combination of zero emission renewable e-fuels and direct electrification \u2013 the most cost-effective options \u2013 would require 44TWh renewable electricity, to produce 140,000 tonnes hydrogen, 3.1 million tonnes ammonia/methanol, and nearly 2TWh shore power. 44TWh would require an additional 1,360 8MW wind turbines.\n\n\nThe briefing showed the energy requirements for the UK of implementing five different zero emission mandate scenarios.\n\n\nEach scenario assumes fulfilment with a combination of direct electrification and green e-fuels, using 100% renewable electricity.\n\n\n![](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-02-at-11.15.06-AM.png)\n\n\n![](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-02-at-11.15.16-AM.png)\n\n\n\u201cMandates are effective instruments to drive the uptake of near-zero- and zero-emission transport fuels. The UK already uses such a mandate (the development fuels sub-target) through the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), whilst another for sustainable aviation fuel is being designed,\u201d it said in the briefing paper.\n\n\n\u201cA mandate either for zero- or near-zero-emission shipping (or specifically on shipping fuels) will certainly be necessary to create a market for both the supply and use of these fuels, and achieve the required emissions reductions for Net Zero and the UK carbon budgets.\u201d\n\n\nT&E added in addition to fulfilment of any UK zero-emission shipping mandate, further abatement will be necessary for compliance with the SBTi pathway.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThis is because, even if the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan assumptions for low-carbon marine fuel uptake for UK domestic and international shipping correlate directly to emissions reductions, a maximum of 30.5% abatement would be achieved in 2035, compared to the SBTi target of 77% reduction by the same date,\u201d it said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAdditional consideration must therefore be given not only to the low-carbon fuel uptake assumptions, but also to targets and even mandates for energy efficiency technologies (to maximise their use by 2025 as envisioned in the Clean Maritime Plan) and speed reduction.\u201d\n\n\n*Note: The full briefing paper of \u2018Implications of an e-fuel mandate for UK shipping\u2019 can be viewed* [*here*](https://www.transportenvironment.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/UK-marine-e-fuel-mandate-28.06.23.pdf)*.*\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPhoto credit: [Chris

flexible polyurethane foam has achieved its own environmental targets ahead of schedule.\n\n\nThe Vita Group's second sustainability report, Enhancing Everyday Life, reveals that the company has made significant progress on the ambitious targets it set out in its inaugural report last year.\n\n\nIt verifies that Vita has achieved a 43% reduction in both its Scope 1\u00a0and 2 carbon emissions, while its greenhouse gas intensity figures have decreased by the same percentage since the 2019 baseline.\n\n\nScope 1 carbon emissions are direct emissions from sources that a company owns or controls directly, such as non-electric vehicles, whilst Scope 2 are indirect emissions originating from energy production.\n\n\nOther achievements include diverting\u00a025,422 tonnes of excess material (trim) from landfill in 2022 and repurposing it, and 31 sites sent zero production waste to landfill, representing a 98% group diversion.\n\n\nLast year Vita made met its initial target to use 100% renewable electricity by 2030 \u2013 eight years ahead of schedule.\n\n\nThese accomplishments have been made possible by working closely with life cycle analysis (LCA) experts, to build product-focused environmental data, using both primary and secondary source data.\n\n\nVita\u2019s LCA methodology will give full transparency to its customers on the environmental impact of its products and will assist them in achieving their own targets or ambitions, as well as allowing them to make trade off decisions such as CO2\u00a0reduction or percentage of sustainable content versus price.\n\n\nLast year, Vita became the first flexible polyurethane manufacturer to be validated by independent climate scientists through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Additionally, it achieved a gold medal from EcoVadis, the world\u2019s most trusted provider of business sustainability ratings, ranking it in the top 3% of assessed organisations worldwide.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n![Ian Robb](/uploads/f1/news/img/2023724_145132.jpg)\nIan Robb\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIan Robb, CEO, The Vita Group, said: \u201cThe second year of our sustainability report reflects the incredible progress our company has made in a relatively short period of time. This has been possible through our work with leaders in other fields such as academia and the chemicals industry, as well as collaborating closely with our suppliers and customers. All of us share a common goal in using the tools at our disposal to innovate and help protect the planet for future generations.\n\n\n\u201cWhile our progress is pleasing, we will not rest on our laurels \u2013 our achievements so far only provide us with more motivation to go even further. Therefore, we will continue to use our R&D capabilities to create products that marry commercial imperatives with sustainability, allowing clients and consumers to be assured Vita is the ethical foam manufacturer of choice.\u201d\n\n\nVita has also committed to incorporating the principles of the UN Global Compact into its strategy, culture, and daily operations. The company will work in collaboration with projects that promote the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, with the aim of achieving broader development goals. This includes implementing practices to tackle poverty and inequality and striving to create a better world for future generations.\n\n\n\n [Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n\n\n\n\n[Follow @rochdaleonline](https://twitter.com/RochdaleOnline)\n\n[Reuse this content](/news-features/content-syndication) \n\n\n\n\nDo you have a story for us? \n\n\nLet us know by emailing [news@rochdaleonline.co.uk](mailto:news@rochdaleonline.co.uk)  \nAll contact will be treated in confidence.\n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Vita Group, a Middleton-based provider of flexible polyurethane foam, has surpassed its sustainability targets ahead of schedule, according to its second sustainability report.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The company has achieved significant progress on its targets, including a reduction in carbon emissions and zero production waste to landfill."}, {"summary": "Vita became the first flexible polyurethane manufacturer to be validated by independent climate scientists and achieved a gold medal from EcoVadis, ranking it in the top 3% of assessed organizations worldwide.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The validation by climate scientists and the gold medal from EcoVadis demonstrate the company's commitment to sustainability and its high rating on business sustainability."}, {"summary": "Vita has committed to incorporating the principles of the UN Global Compact into its strategy and operations, working towards achieving broader development goals.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The commitment to the UN Global Compact shows the company's dedication to global development goals and creating a better world."}], "semantic_commentary": "Vita Group's sustainability success aligns with our carbon credit goals.", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions that Vita Group has surpassed its sustainability targets and achieved a gold medal from EcoVadis, indicating a commitment to reducing their carbon footprint."}]}, {"source": "Vaping Post", "link": "https://www.vapingpost.com/2023/07/31/bat-strives-to-be-considered-sustainable-and-joins-the-business-for-natures-call/", "title": "BAT Strives to be Considered Sustainable And Joins The \"Business for Nature\u2019s Call\"\u00a0 - Vaping Post", "content": "\nAmongst other things BAT plans on reducing emissions by half across its value chain by 2030, with 2020 as baseline, and with the aim of reaching net zero by 2050.It is no secret that the tobacco industry [contributes greatly](https://www.vapingpost.com/2022/11/09/new-infographic-reveals-the-worlds-worst-cigarette-butts-polluters/) to world pollution. Besides the chemicals that leak into the environment via discarded cigarette butts, tobacco is normally grown on deforested lands and its production degrades soil and pollutes air, land and water.\nMeanwhile, in the midst of (and perhaps in response to) the criticism and disdain that all tobacco giants are rightly faced with, BAT is striving to promote itself as working to advance sustainable agriculture practices in the aim of contributing to a \u201cA Better Tomorrow.\u201d Joining over 300 businesses in [signing Business for Nature\u2019s call](https://www.businessfornature.org/make-it-mandatory-campaign) to protect and restore biodiversity ahead of the [COP-15 UN Biodiversity Conference](https://www.unep.org/events/conference/un-biodiversity-conference-cop-15), the tobacco company aimed to prove its commitment in protecting biodiversity.\n\n\n\u201cAt BAT we are committed to protecting biodiversity.

Part of the plan includes reducing emissions by half across its value chain by 2030, with 2020 as baseline, and with the aim of reaching net zero by 2050. The publication of the plan followed obtaining approval of its 1.5\u00baC-aligned trajectory in July 2022, from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\n\nBAT\u2019s Chief Growth Officer, Kingsley Wheaton, said that this latest plan is part of the tobacco company\u2019s commitment to demonstrate that it wants to contribute to a [sustainable future](https://www.vapingpost.com/2022/04/13/big-tobaccos-attempts-to-become-more-sustainable/). \u201cWe\u2019re proud to take this latest step in our sustainability journey. By outlining the measures we will take to live up to our Net Zero targets through our Low-Carbon Transition Plan, we\u2019re demonstrating our continuing commitment to building A Better Tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nEarlier this month the tobacco giant reported [half-year results](https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK__CRHJSY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOCU2KHU/$file/HY_2023_Announcement.pdf) indicating that its number of non-combustible products grew by 1.5m, with its half-year profit reaching \u00a35.94bn. \u201cWe are now close to breakeven,\u201d said CEO Tadeu Marroco. He added that revenue from non-combustibles now makes up 16.6% of group revenue. However, he said, while vape and oral products are performing well, more attention needs to be given to the heated tobacco sector.\u00a0\n\n\nPMK launches new heated tobacco device\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nIn other news, earlier this year the South Korean division of BAT\u2019s main competitor [Philip Morris](https://www.vapingpost.com/2022/10/14/pmi-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-branch-out-into-wellness-and-healthcare/), said that Iqos Iluma One was be released on the market.

Ministers have announced a number of steps to meet these goals, including the piloting of a Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment, the introduction of a mandatory biodiversity net gain requirement in the Environment Act (from November 2023) and working with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures to develop metrics for companies and financial institutions to embed into their investment decision making. Earlier this year in its Nature Markets Framework, the Environment Secretary stated that measures such as carbon sequestration, clean water, biodiversity and natural flood management remained \u201csystematically undervalued\u201d in the UK economy, and the Government set out further plans to support the flow of private finance to support the \u2018nature positive economy\u2019.\n\n\nNatural capital, defined by Professor Sir Partha Dasgupta in his 2021 review of the economics of biodiversity, is \u201cthe stock of renewable and non-renewable natural assets (e.g. ecosystems) that yield a flow of benefits to people (i.e. ecosystem services). The term \u2018natural capital\u2019 is used to emphasise it is a capital asset, like produced capital (roads and buildings) and human capital (knowledge and skills).\u201d\n\n\nAs part of this new inquiry, the Committee seeks to understand whether the Government\u2019s policies to promote natural capital and investment in biodiversity protection is adequate. It will look at the role private investment can make, and how the UK might develop world-leading markets in natural capital assets while avoiding the \u2018greenwashing\u2019 of investments.\n\n\nChair's comment\n---------------\n\n\nEnvironmental Audit Committee Chairman, Rt Hon Philip Dunne MP, said:\n\n\n\u201cNature and biodiversity are declining at an alarming rate in the UK, and adequate safeguards must be embedded to avoid any further loss. The financial sector will have a significant role to play in promoting the development and enhancement of the nation\u2019s natural capital \u2013 from air to water, soil to forests \u2013 as the UK economy begins to embrace the economics of biodiversity.\n\n\n\u201cThe Committee seeks to understand how the UK\u2019s markets in natural capital are developing, and whether the frameworks that have been put in place, and the measures being encouraged by Ministers, are sufficient to promote investment in nature recovery while establishing the UK as a leading financial centre for nature positive investment.   \n  \n\u201cWe will look at measures to prevent greenwashing in the natural capital sector so that the investment and policies really do make a material and nature positive difference to environmental recovery and levels of biodiversity across the UK.  \n  \n\u201cI encourage anyone engaged in the development of natural capital markets to contribute to our inquiry.\u201d\n\n\nTerms of reference\n------------------\n\n\nThe Committee invites written submissions addressing any or all of the issues raised in the following terms of reference, by 17:00 on Friday 22nd September 2023.\n\n\n1. What potential contribution can private capital investment make to measures to secure nature recovery?\n2. How can investment best be aligned with environmental benefits, so as to achieve or surpass the Government\u2019s targets for nature recovery?\n3. What measures are necessary to (a) establish and (b) maintain the high-integrity markets in ecosystem services which are expected to attract private investment? What confidence do investors currently have in the UK\u2019s arrangements for these markets?\n4. What contribution will data from the Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) programme make to the objective measurement of changes in environmental outcomes?\n5. How can the proposed UK Green Taxonomy support high-quality investments which deliver genuine benefits to nature? What financial disclosures should the taxonomy require?\n6. How can the operation of natural capital markets ensure genuine net gains for nature? How do such markets address the risk of \u2018greenwashing\u2019 of investments and the offsetting of natural recovery in the UK against environmental degradation elsewhere?\n7. What role can the UK\u2019s financial markets play in developing the flow of international capital into the development of natural capital in the UK and globally?\n8. What role does the UK have in establishing international standards for natural capital investments, alongside other jurisdictions and financial centres?\n\n\nFurther information\n-------------------\n\n\n* [About Parliament: Select committees](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/select/)\n* [Visiting Parliament: Watch committees](https://www.parliament.uk/visiting/visiting-and-tours/watch-committees-and-debates/committees/)\n\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The UK Government is committed to leaving the environment in a better state than before and reversing biodiversity loss globally by 2030.

legislation](/news/2018-05-04/land-clearing-laws-tightened-as-farmers-fear-for-future/9722416) to crack down on what it called \"unsustainable\" clearing, which included removing provisions that allowed new areas to be cleared for high-value agriculture.\n\n\"A\u00a0great outcome for biodiversity and carbon emission reductions in Queensland,\" state Resources Minister Scott Stewart said.\u00a0\n\nThe minister said there was still work to be done to eliminate unlawful clearing.\n\n\"We'll continue to work with landholders to educate and assist them in understanding their obligations,\" Mr Stewart said.\n\n\"The majority of landholders are complying with our vegetation management laws.\"\n\nReason for clearing in the 2020-21 SLATS

shrubs are on it, where it is, and what it is used for\u00a0to determine what level of clearing is allowed.\n\nOf the total area cleared, 82 per cent was in category X\u00a0\u2014 land that has previously been cleared,\u00a0the only unregulated category.\n\nHannah Schuch from the Wilderness Society said category X should also be covered by the legislation.\n\n\"It's a massive omission,\" Ms

stripping the land of all its trees\u00a0and was often done for environmental management.\n\n\"It's not broadscale clearing,\" CEO Michael Guerin said.\n\nHe said in bio-regions like the mulga lands of south-west Queensland, which stretches from Charleville to White Cliffs in NSW, clearing can improve the diversity of species.\n\n\"If you don't manage the mulga lands what you get is a thickening\u00a0that ultimately ends up squeezing out biodiversity,\" he said.\n\nMr Guerin said the legislation needed to recognise that different land management practices were needed for the 13 different bio-regions across the state.\n\n\"We can be very proud of it to continue to produce the food we take for granted in supermarkets\u00a0while\u00a0protecting the environment,\" he

Then they added up the contributions from all plant-fungi pairs.\n\nThe number they came up with was 13.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide. To put that in perspective, the total amount of carbon emitted globally in 2021 was about 36.6 gigatons. \n\nThe researchers also said that plants associated with mycorrhizal fungi can take in eight times more carbon than plants that are not. \n\n[The results](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(23)00167-7.pdf) were published recently in the journal Current Biology.\n\n [![illustration of a man in the desert with a large hot sun behind him. a wavy heat effect animates.](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/612fcc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1600+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F54%2F5dbd03cb417ab98bbc6e861590cf%2Fheat-large-sun-blur.gif)](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-27/she-will-never-forget-this-haunting-death-valley-encounter)    [California](https://www.latimes.com/california) \n\n ###  [I searched hell on Earth for a story. What I found will haunt me forever](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-27/she-will-never-forget-this-haunting-death-valley-encounter)\n\n A visit to Death Valley National Park has profound consequences for a veteran of extreme temperature. \u201cI thought I knew heat.\u201d\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\nThe study represents the first attempt to quantify the total amount of carbon being transferred to mycorrhizal fungi across the globe. The authors cautioned that their calculation is an estimate, adding that they suspect the fungi are probably receiving more carbon than they were able to account for.\n\n \u201cWe know that soil is an important carbon sink,\u201d said [Heidi-Jayne Hawkins](https://science.uct.ac.za/department-biological-sciences/contacts/heidi-jayne-hawkins), a plant eco-physiology researcher at the University of Cape Town in South Africa and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cBut mycorrhizal fungi have not been explicitly evaluated for their role in this carbon sink, which could help inform land use planning and conservation.\u201d\n\nThe study results can improve the accuracy of climate models and help scientists better predict what would happen if the fungi were lost in the future, she said.\n\n[Stephanie Kivlin](https://eeb.utk.edu/people/stephanie-kivlin/), an ecologist at University of Tennessee, said the study is a crucial step toward improving our understanding of the plant-fungi duo\u2019s role in reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThese mutualisms can act as a critical carbon sink in many terrestrial ecosystems,\u201d she said.\n\nNot only do the fungi take in carbon from plants, they also help keep that carbon safely below ground by creating a sticky compound that holds the soil together, preventing erosion.\n\nAlthough mycorrhizal fungi have short life spans \u2014 only a few years \u2014 their usefulness doesn\u2019t end after death. \n\n\u201cThis is my favorite part,\u201d Kiers said. \u201cAfter they die, they make \u2018necromass,\u2019 a dead underground network that acts as a scaffolding to hold the soil together,\u201d locking the carbon in place.\n\nBut fertilizers interfere with this relationship. If plants can get their nutrients from fertilizers, they become less dependent on the mycorrhizal fungi. That limits the growth of the underground fungal matrix, resulting in soil erosion and ultimately more carbon winding up back in the atmosphere.\n\nCompared with native plants, fertilized crops send only about one-fourth as much carbon underground, Kiers said. [The rapid conversion](https://ourworldindata.org/peak-agriculture-land) of wild areas to agricultural ones will reduce the amount of carbon stored in the soil, she said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only part of the problem. Kiers said there is so much fertilizer in the environment that it has made its way into rain clouds and waterways, which means it can reach [plants outside of croplands](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-agriculture) and harm fungi in the wild as well.\n\nQuantifying the amount of carbon held by mycorrhizal fungi in various ecosystems can help conservationists identify land areas that are most in need of restoration and protection, Hawkins said.\n\n \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand what land we have to urgently conserve and how to restore natural areas,\u201d Kiers said. \u201cWe want to make sure these fungi are an important component of that.\u201d  \n\n\n ", "summaries": [{"summary": "Plants receive help from mycorrhizal fungi underground, which capture and deliver 36% of carbon released from burning fossil fuels to the fungi system, reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The symbiotic relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi helps capture carbon and reduce greenhouse gases, presenting a positive impact on the environment."}, {"summary": "The study estimates that mycorrhizal fungi transfer 13.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide underground, leading to a decrease in atmospheric carbon.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The significant amount of carbon dioxide transferred to mycorrhizal fungi demonstrates the effectiveness of the symbiotic relationship in carbon sequestration, indicating a positive outcome."}, {"summary": "Mycorrhizal fungi play a crucial role in reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and preventing soil erosion by creating a sticky compound that holds the soil together.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The fungi's ability to act as a carbon sink and prevent soil erosion showcases their positive contribution to the environment."}, {"summary": "Fertilizers interfere with the plant-fungi relationship, limiting the transfer of carbon underground and leading to soil erosion and increased atmospheric carbon.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The negative impact of fertilizers on the plant-fungi relationship results in reduced carbon sequestration, soil erosion, and an increase in atmospheric carbon."}, {"summary": "Quantifying the carbon held by mycorrhizal fungi can inform land use planning and conservation efforts, aiding in the restoration and protection of natural areas.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Understanding the carbon storage capacity of mycorrhizal fungi helps identify areas that require conservation and restoration measures, leading to positive outcomes for natural ecosystems."}], "semantic_commentary": "Article supports carbon credit trading by highlighting the role of mycorrhizal fungi in reducing carbon dioxide and aiding in land restoration.", "sentiment_score": 0.6, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions systems (mycorrhizal fungi) that remove carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news (study and estimates) about carbon."}]}, {"source": "Carbon Pulse", "link": "https://carbon-pulse.com/214688/", "title": "CP Daily: Tuesday August 1, 2023 \u00ab Carbon Pulse", "content": "\nPresenting CP Daily, Carbon Pulse\u2019s free newsletter.

Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies [have also reported sharp drops](https://carbon-pulse.com/214229/) in quarterly earnings, due to a drop in energy prices from highs hit following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine a year and a half ago.\n\n\n**Amazon guarantees** \u2013 Brazil will push the EU for better trading terms in return for offering environmental guarantees over protection of the Amazon rainforest, said a diplomat with knowledge of the EU-Mercosur trade deal negotiations, [as reported by Climate Home News](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/08/01/brazil-mercosur-amazon-eu-trade/). EU negotiators included a \u201cside letter\u201d this year to the trade deal originally struck in 2019, adding environmental guarantees to the original accord in order to prevent against a relapse of environmental protection in the Amazon. The new Brazilian government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, which has made bold pledges to environmental protection, has taken its time to come up with a response. South American trade bloc Mercosur is expected to prepare its counterproposal this week before meeting with EU negotiators in August in the hopes of closing the accord by the end of the year. Brazil diplomats have complained that the new rules go beyond the Paris climate agreement.\n\n\n***EMEA***\n\n\n**Common understanding \u2013** The European Commission has set important framework conditions for planned German state support to build and operate about 24 GW hydrogen power plants and fossil gas units, which will later be converted to hydrogen, the economy ministry said. The ministry and Commission have worked out a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d for support to build such gas-fired power plants, which the government considers a necessary supplement to intermittent renewables to secure the electricity supply. ([Clean Energy Wire](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/eu-sets-state-support-conditions-german-gas-and-hydrogen-power-plants-econ-min))\n\n\n**Climate pricing** \u2013 Linking the pricing of products to their climate impact is the idea behind a week-long experiment at a leading discount supermarket in Germany, [reports the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/31/german-supermarket-penny-trial-climate-cost-food-meat-cheese). The experiment will see all 2,150 branches of the Penny chain increase the prices of a selection of products, mainly dairy and meat, in relation to their effect on soil, climate, water use and health. The campaign has seen the price of wiener sausages rise from \u20ac3.19 to \u20ac6.01, mozzarella go up by 74% to \u20ac1.55, and fruit yoghurt increase by 31% from \u20ac1.19 to \u20ac1.56. The experiment is being led in partnership with academics from the Nuremberg Institute of Technology and the University of Greifswald and is intended to help raise consumer awareness of the true environmental impact of certain foods. Excess proceeds made from the sales will be donated to charity Zukunftsbauer or Future Farmer, which supports family-run farms in Alpine regions, many of which are struggling amid low returns.\n\n\n**French resilience** \u2013 France has submitted a second request to the European Commission for approval for a payment of over \u20ac10 bln under the recovery and resilience plan, as part of the NextGenerationEU fund set up for member states recovery following the pandemic. The funding will go to investments like renovating buildings to improve their energy performance and retraining or upskilling the workforce. The entire French recovery and resilience plan consists of 20 reforms and 71 investments that will be supported by \u20ac39.4 bln in grants, some 46% of which will support climate objectives and 21% will foster the digital transition.\n\n\n***ASIA PACIFIC***\n\n\n**Serious threat**\u2013 UN scientific advisors have recommended the Great Barrier Reef not be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger, but stressed coral reef system remains under \u2018serious threat\u2019 from global heating and water pollution, [the Guardian reports](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/01/climate-crisis-great-barrier-reef-unesco-australia). UNESCO said in a report that the Australian government had taken positive steps to protect the reef since a UN monitoring mission visited Queensland in March last year. But UNESCO has essentially put Australia on notice, recommending the government provide a progress report in February, before the reef is reconsidered to be put on the \u2018in danger\u2019 list again in 2024. The Australian government said the report was confirmation it was acting on climate change.\n\n\n**Better predictions** \u2013 Japan\u2019s Chubu Electric Power has introduced the use of distribution future energy scenarios (DFES) in its power systems through the collaboration with the Mitsubishi Research Institute, in a bid to better formulate plans for power transmission and distribution facilities that support carbon neutrality, according to a statement released this week. The Japanese power company will use the newly developed DFES to improve demand forecasting based on the characteristics of each region and utilise distributed energy resources, such as solar and battery storage, it said.\n\n\n**Nuclear expansion** \u2013 China has given the green light to several expansion projects at three existing nuclear plants amid rising concerns over energy security, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-approves-expansions-three-nuclear-power-plants-2023-08-01/) reports, citing a statement from the State Council.

The EEI supplies power to 250 mln Americans, making it the largest group of utilities in the country. Space constraints for carbon capture facilities are among the issues the EEI has with the plan. The group has until Aug. 8 to submit public comment.\n\n\n**A little bit longer \u2013** A coal-fired unit at a Texas power station, expected to host a carbon capture project that was shuttered in 2020, [will return to service](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/restart-delayed-texas-coal-unit-linked-petra-nova-ccs-project-2023-08-01/) in late August, months later than originally planned, the utility NRG said on Tuesday. Unit 8 at the WA Parish plant in Richmond, Texas closed after a fire in May 2022. NRG brought back the 600-MW unit for several days last week in test mode and now expects it to return in late August after originally planning to restart it in late June. The coal unit had hosted the $1 bln Petra Nova CCS plant, which sent the CO2 gas about 80 miles (130 km) by pipeline where it was pumped into an aging oilfield to boost output. NRG shut Petra Nova on May 1, 2020, citing a plunge in oil prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. JX Nippon, a Japanese energy company, is now the sole owner of Petra Nova after buying NRG\u2019s share last year. JX Nippon has said previously that the CCS plant will start up once Unit 8 resumes service. (Reuters)\n\n\n**Green gas \u2013** Renewable fuel firm Verde Clean Fuels is entering an agreement with a Brookfield Renewable-affiliated carbon capture outfit, Carbon TerraVault, according to press release on Tuesday. Brookfield and the California Resources Corporation run Carbon TerraVault as a partnership, and Verde will build a renewable gasoline facility on California Resources Corporation\u2019s land under the agreement. As much as 100,000 tCO2 is expected to get captured at Verde\u2019s facility every year, producing 21,000 gal (79,493 litres) of renewable gasoline per day.\n\n\n***VOLUNTARY***\n\n\n**Loomis left \u2013**\u00a0$310 bln Natixis affiliate Loomis Sayles has become the [latest asset manager to distance itself](https://citywire.com/selector/news/loomis-sayles-exits-climate-action-100-citing-financial-reasons/a2422880) from ESG-related investment practices as it leaves the Climate Action 100+ initiative \u201cas a result of our routine evaluations to ensure that all our industry commitments continue to be aligned with the firm\u2019s ESG philosophy\u201d a company spokesperson said.

Carbon neutrality for the company will apply to Scope 1 and 2 emissions during Financial Year 2023, and it will purchase carbon credits and other environmental products by the end of the following year.

The new funds are intended to accelerate the development and sales of SensorUp\u2019s gas emissions management solution. The Calgary-based company, founded in 2012, helps oil and gas companies to be compliant with international standards around methane through its data-integration platform for methane leak detection and repair, measurement reconciliation, reporting, and verification of methane emissions. Climate Investment was founded by OGCI, an organisation of energy and oil and gas CEOs.\n\n\n***AND FINALLY\u2026***\n\n\n**Space sunshade** \u2013 Using a huge sunshade to lower the intensity of sunlight reaching the earth, paired with an asteroid acting as a counterweight to balance gravitational forces, has been proposed as a method to counteract climate change by an astronomer from the University of Hawaii\u2019s Institute for Astronomy. The calculations were done with the goal of curtailing solar radiation by 1.7%, the amount scientists believe is necessary to avert \u2018disastrous\u2019 global temperature increases. The researchers theorised that a tethered counterbalance facing the sun could minimise the weight of the shield to around 3.5 Mt, which is almost 100 times lighter than former estimates of an untethered shield.

(ANI/WAM):\u00a0Dr Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary-General of the [Environment Agency in Abu Dhabi](/topic/environment-agency-in-abu-dhabi) ([EAD](/topic/ead)), praised the [Decarbonisation Plan](/topic/decarbonisation-plan) recently launched by [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc), [EAD](/topic/ead)'s key implementation partner in Abu Dhabi\u2019s Climate Change Strategy, lauding [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc)\u2019s innovative and forward-looking solutions to achieve the objectives of this ambitious strategy.  \nThe five-year Abu Dhabi Climate Change Strategy is a major contribution to Abu Dhabi\u2019s climate action ambitions at various levels and will help achieve the objectives of the [UAE](/topic/uae)'s strategic Net Zero by 2050 initiative, which was pledged by the [UAE](/topic/uae)\u2019s leadership, as a national drive aimed at reducing emissions.  \nThe strategy will drive innovation in carbon capture and storage efforts and identifies measures for diversifying the economy to include low-carbon sectors. In specific for the oil and gas sector the target set by the strategy is 25 percent reduction of [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc) carbon intensity by 2030 to achieve a level amongst the lowest emissions per barrel of oil in the industry globally.  \nCommenting on [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc)\u2019s [Decarbonisation Plan](/topic/decarbonisation-plan), Dr Shaikha said, \u201cThe oil and gas industry is one of the most economically important sectors as well as one of the key emitting sectors in the emirate.  \nTherefore, the decrease in the sector\u2019s emissions intensity to levels that are considered among the lowest in the world, and the announcement of a reduction in carbon emissions of nearly 5.4 million tonnes across [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc)\u2019s operations in 2022 is an important milestone in the emirate\u2019s strategic climate action pathway.\u201d  \n\n\n \nSponsored Content\n\n[[![](https://cdn.mgid.com/images/mgid/mgid_ua.svg)](https://widgets.mgid.com/?utm_source=www.aninews.in&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=widgets&utm_content=713570)\n\n\n[![](https://cdn.mgid.com/images/logos/Adchoices.svg)](https://www.mgid.com/services/privacy-policy)](#)\n\n\n[![](https://s-img.mgid.com/g/16780663/492x277/-/aHR0cDovL2NsLmltZ2hvc3RzLmNvbS9pbWdoL2ltYWdlL2ZldGNoL2FyXzE2OjksY19maWxsLGVfc2hhcnBlbjoxMDAsZl9qcGcsZ19mYWNlczphdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLHdfMTAyMC9odHRwOi8vaW1naG9zdHMuY29tL3QvMjAyMy0wNy8xODU3NzcvYThkNjVjNzBlMGNkYzYyNjdjMWE2ZTNlMzQxOTAzNGMuanBn.jpg?v=1691021884-3dQxxjrPtJPG146wRsdboNcznxBeifLManjM-c4dRHY)](https://neotonics/Forget_Retinol_Use_This_Household_Item_To_Fill_In_Wrinkles)[Neotonics](https://neotonics/Forget_Retinol_Use_This_Household_Item_To_Fill_In_Wrinkles)[Forget Retinol, Use This Household Item To Fill In Wrinkles](https://neotonics/Forget_Retinol_Use_This_Household_Item_To_Fill_In_Wrinkles)[Neotonics](https://neotonics/Forget_Retinol_Use_This_Household_Item_To_Fill_In_Wrinkles)[Neotonics](https://neotonics/Forget_Retinol_Use_This_Household_Item_To_Fill_In_Wrinkles)[Craft Hub](https://crafthub/Premium_Wooden_Jigsaw_Puzzles_-_Closing_Sale_-_85_Off)[Premium Wooden Jigsaw Puzzles - Closing Sale - 85% Off](https://crafthub/Premium_Wooden_Jigsaw_Puzzles_-_Closing_Sale_-_85_Off)[Craft Hub](https://crafthub/Premium_Wooden_Jigsaw_Puzzles_-_Closing_Sale_-_85_Off)[Craft Hub](https://crafthub/Premium_Wooden_Jigsaw_Puzzles_-_Closing_Sale_-_85_Off)[![](https://s-img.mgid.com/g/16132236/492x277/-/aHR0cDovL2NsLmltZ2hvc3RzLmNvbS9pbWdoL2ltYWdlL2ZldGNoL2FyXzE2OjksY19maWxsLGVfc2hhcnBlbjoxMDAsZl9qcGcsZ19mYWNlczphdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLHdfMTAyMC9odHRwOi8vaW1naG9zdHMuY29tL3QvMjAyMy0wMS81ODM1NDQvODVjMGIyYTIxNzFmZTMzZjI4YzQ4MmRlZDk2NTA4MGMuanBn.jpg?v=1691021884-FC5verF4mOiWZG3dKNOhcFO7OTNLhD1f17k-UEO1QxM)](https://searchads/The_Actual_Cost_Of_Cremation_May_Change_Your_Mind_About_It)[Search Ads](https://searchads/The_Actual_Cost_Of_Cremation_May_Change_Your_Mind_About_It)[The Actual Cost Of Cremation May Change Your Mind About It](https://searchads/The_Actual_Cost_Of_Cremation_May_Change_Your_Mind_About_It)[Search Ads](https://searchads/The_Actual_Cost_Of_Cremation_May_Change_Your_Mind_About_It)[Search Ads](https://searchads/The_Actual_Cost_Of_Cremation_May_Change_Your_Mind_About_It)[![](https://s-img.mgid.com/g/16689042/492x277/-/aHR0cDovL2NsLmltZ2hvc3RzLmNvbS9pbWdoL2ltYWdlL2ZldGNoL2FyXzE2OjksY19maWxsLGVfc2hhcnBlbjoxMDAsZl9qcGcsZ19mYWNlczphdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLHdfMTAyMC9odHRwOi8vaW1naG9zdHMuY29tL3QvMjAyMy0wNy81ODM1NDQvZmFlMTcxYmQ0NWI4MDk5MTM1NjI2MzZkZWE2YzI3OGQuanBn.jpg?v=1691021884-KrRGwWMmHuYKlEbkyoNaMqQRN3dNem0GX-3lVk0BIfE)](https://searchads/Whitening_Toothpastes_In_2023_Might_Surprise_You)[Search Ads](https://searchads/Whitening_Toothpastes_In_2023_Might_Surprise_You)[Whitening Toothpastes In 2023 Might Surprise You!](https://searchads/Whitening_Toothpastes_In_2023_Might_Surprise_You)[Search Ads](https://searchads/Whitening_Toothpastes_In_2023_Might_Surprise_You)[Search Ads](https://searchads/Whitening_Toothpastes_In_2023_Might_Surprise_You) She elaborated, \u201c[EAD](/topic/ead) and [ADNOC](/topic/adnoc)\u2019s cooperation journey to transform the energy sector began more than 15 years ago.

Lexology", "content": "\n\n> China\u2019s efforts to encourage businesses to cut emissions and improve carbon data transparency are critical to achieving a sustainable future. From the national emissions trading system expanding and opening to foreign investment, to carbon cutting incentives for individuals, there is a rising tide of carbon-related initiatives across China.\n\n\n\n> In this Featured Insight, we look at four trends that, combined, are transforming the carbon settings across China and sending a strong signal to the world as it transitions to a net zero economy.\n\n\nChina\u2019s laws and regulations are improving the carbon settings of the world\u2019s biggest emitter. China\u2019s commitment to hit peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 (30-60 target) is at the heart of this shift.\n\n\nIn this Featured Insight, we look at four trends that, combined, are transforming the carbon settings across China and sending a strong signal to the world as it transitions to a net zero economy.\n\n\n1. Ongoing improvements and internationalisation of carbon markets\n2. Enhanced trading products and platforms \u2013 including diverse carbon finance and derivatives products\n3. Improving transparency via corporate environmental data disclosure\n4. Initiatives to empower and incentivize individuals to cut their own carbon footprint.\n\n\nWe are watching developments and actively contributing to the evolution of China\u2019s carbon market, development of carbon finance and derivatives, and improvements of the standard and certification systems for carbon data disclosure. [Subscribe to our Climate & ESG updates](https://pages.kwm.com/Subscribe-climate-ESG) for more insights.\n\n\n**China\u2019s carbon markets move to internationalisation and financial product complexity, led by regions**\n\n\nBoth of China\u2019s dual carbon market segments are experiencing rapid growth and development \u2013 the Compliance Carbon Market (trading China Emission Allowances (**CEA**)), and the Voluntary Carbon Market (focused on China Certified Emission Reduction (**CCER**)).\n\n\n**Compliance carbon markets are evolving to capture more sectors**\n\n\nChina boasts world's largest carbon allowance trading market in its National Emission Trading System (**National ETS**), which launched in 2021 and hit a cumulative trading volume of more than 200mn tons by the end of 2022. Yet it is China\u2019s pre-existing regional pilot schemes that are setting an example for the rest of the nation, positioning forward-thinking regions as pioneers.\n\n\nThe national scheme is expected to reflect this regional progress in time, under draft regulations to gradually integrate local carbon emissions trading into the national market. This creation of one unified national carbon trading system demonstrates China's commitment to addressing emissions in various industries and promoting sustainable development.\n\n\n![](https://d2dzik4ii1e1u6.cloudfront.net/images/lexology/static/05a848c6-f739-4fa3-bbbf-2af70a90b85f.jpg)\n\n\n**Trading evolution - increasing participation and complexity of financial derivatives** \n\n\nAs carbon markets expand, trading is becoming more complex. Platforms are allowing cross-border trades and products are diversifying, including derivatives.\n\n\n**Trading platforms allow cross-border transactions**\n\n\nThere are two international emission trading platforms: one in Hainan, the other Hong Kong. Both allow cross-border trades.\n\n\n* The Hainan International Carbon Emissions Trading Center launched in July 2022. Six months later the first cross-border carbon trade took place, involving the trading of Verified Carbon Units (**VCUs**) under the globally recognized Verified Carbon Standard (**VCS**). The trade originated from India, with a total volume of 10,185 tons.\n* The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (**HKEx**) introduced a new international carbon market called Core Climate on 28 October 2022. Participants on the platform can access product information and engage in voluntary carbon credit trading.\n* The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (**MEE**) is promoting the construction of a centralised voluntary emission reduction trading market and plans to reopen the CCER market. The CCER is widely anticipated to resume soon.\n\n\n**Financial complexity is evolving beyond spot trades \u2013 and infrastructure is adjusting**\n\n\n* **Financial derivatives have emerged** in regional pilots, include funds, bonds, pledge financing and repo financing, adding depth and diversity to the market. These innovations have developed in several pilot regions including Beijing, Hubei, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou.\n* **The Guangzhou Futures Exchange** plans to introduce green and low-carbon futures trading products, such as CEAs.\n* **Financial institutions are increasingly engaging** **in the carbon market**. Eight securities companies are authorised to trade carbon emissions using their own funds, having received non-objection letters from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.\n* **Carbon trading infrastructure is evolving.** The Shanghai Clearing House treats carbon emissions as commodities and provides central counterparty clearing for CNY Emission Allowance Forward (**CEAF**). Additionally, Hubei has proposed creating a clearing infrastructure for spot and derivatives in the carbon market.\n* **We expect Hong Kong and Mainland's carbon derivatives market will soon interconnect.** The Inter-agency Supervisory Group released a feasibility assessment exploring investor access to China's carbon market via the Greater Bay Area platform, promoting carbon market interconnection. It proposes including carbon derivatives provisions in legislation.\n\n\n**China\u2019s efforts to improve carbon data transparency**\n\n\nSince 2020, China has introduced voluntary and mandatory measures to enhance transparency, responsibility and incentivise emission reduction for sustainable development.\n\n\n**Policies encourage voluntary environmental information disclosure**\n\n\nVoluntary environmental disclosure helps companies to establish a positive social reputation and facilitates financing (given China\u2019s urging of banks to consider environmental reports to encourage sustainable practices).\n\n\n![](https://d2dzik4ii1e1u6.cloudfront.net/images/lexology/static/9948c4da-41d7-4b87-9508-9018d368bec2.jpg)\n\n\n* **Listed companies** are encouraged to disclose environmental information including regarding verification, appraisal and evaluation by third-party organisations. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange (**SZSE**) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (**SSE**) also promote disclosure of pollutant data in social responsibility reports or individual reports.\n* **Listed companies controlled by state-owned enterprise** **(SOE)** are encouraged to disclose ESG reports by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (**SASAC**), aiming for \"full coverage\" by 2023.\n\n\n**Mandatory disclosure requirements have grown \u2013 and the trend will continue**\n\n\nCompanies must disclose environmental information under regulations implemented in 2015. The scope expanded in 2022 to cover more entities, introduce a centralized reporting system, require detailed carbon emissions information and increase the maximum fine to 100,000 yuan. Currently, enforcement primarily relies on administrative penalties and civil liabilities, but a comprehensive system is planned.\n\n\n* **Timely, truthful, accurate and complete** disclosure is required.\n* **A comprehensive mandatory disclosure system** is planned by 2025, under the \"Reform Plan for the Mandatory Disclosure of Environmental Information\" released in 2021.\n* **Administrative penalties** apply to enterprises that fail to disclose environmental information truthfully and accurately. This includes orders of correction from government authorities, public notices of criticism and fines.\n* **Civil liability (based on judicial opinions) may** apply to:\n\t+ listed companies and debt-issuing enterprises that fail to disclose investment details, including climate change and environmental issues of financed projects, per updated \"Administrative Measures\".\n\t+ key pollution-discharging companies, their subsidiaries, and listed companies in specific industries like thermal power generation that fail to disclose environmental information under the \"Securities Law\" and securities exchange regulations.\n\n\n**Providing guidance for enterprises to disclose environmental information**\n\n\nChina is also guiding enterprises to standardise the disclosure of environmental information.\n\n\n* An **adaptable framework** for disclosing environmental information - \"Corporate ESG Disclosure Guidelines\" (T/CERDS 2-2022) \u2013 was developed by the China Enterprise Reform and Development Research Society. It introduces the concept of Scopes One, Two, and Three in the GHG Protocol, covering emissions from operational activities, energy consumption and the entire value chain.\n* **Disclosure requirements for financial institutions** are specified in The People's Bank of China's \"Guidelines on Environmental Information Disclosure for Financial Institutions\", including qualitative and quantitative information. Each financial sub-sector, including commercial banks, has guidelines on the measurement and basis of quantitative information based on operational characteristics. These standards normalise behavior and promote transparency and credibility.\n\n\n**Private enterprises have taken strides too \u2013 disclosing corporate emissions and product carbon footprint**\n\n\nMany Chinese enterprises have disclosed carbon emissions data in \"carbon neutral\" or related reports. Some companies publish carbon neutral verification reports for products.\n\n\nMost reports are produced by recognized third-party certification bodies following international accounting standards, ensuring a certain level of international recognition.\n\n\n**How individuals are taking part in disclosing and cutting emissions**\n\n\nCorporate-led personal carbon accounts are enhancing transparency and widening environmental information disclosure. These systems lower participation barriers and costs to enable individuals to get involved and promote sustainable practices.\n\n\n* **People are incentivised to cut personal carbon emissions** through low-carbon behavior via platforms like Ant Group's \"Ant Forest\".\n* Users earn rewards, such as green energy, trees or protected land, based on their carbon reduction achievements.\n\n\n**The next frontier: further opening to foreigners, expanding carbon trading and boosting certification**\n\n\nAs China's carbon market system becomes more sophisticated and with the impending return of CCER, we anticipate that China's carbon market will further open to investors worldwide.\n\n\nThe unification and expansion of China\u2019s national ETS, along with the gradual liberalisation of voluntary carbon market products like CCERs, will significantly enlarge China\u2019s carbon market. This will enhance the effectiveness of the carbon pricing mechanism and encourage more businesses to participate. So too will increased connections, such as between Hong Kong and Mainland derivatives.\n\n\nFinancial and derivative innovation will lead to a wider range of financial and derivative products in China\u2019s carbon trading arena. The implementation of the Futures and Derivatives Act will support this, working to align with international rules and enhance the enforceability and irrevocability of netting termination.\n\n\nThe increased standardisation, certification and accreditation systems will help to promote the international recognition of China\u2019s carbon assets. China will expedite the approval of national standards for carbon emissions accounting and verification, along with making domestic standards more coherent with mainstream international standards in key areas. China will also encourage domestic certification bodies to participate in international carbon emission certification programs and international carbon emission certification systems with mutual recognition. This is to address the insufficient number of accredited certification bodies compared to the large number of Chinese enterprises.\n\n\nChina's efforts to accelerate voluntary cuts to emissions and carbon data transparency for corporations are critical steps towards achieving a sustainable future.

In the report, revenue is based on the location of the project supplier rather than the actual location of the project.\n\n\nCarbon offsets are measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) and may represent six primary categories of greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). One carbon offset represents the reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases. There are two markets for carbon offsets. In the larger, compliance market, companies, governments, or other entities buy carbon offsets in order to comply with caps on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit. This market exists in order to achieve compliance with obligations of the Kyoto Protocol, and of liable entities under the EU Emission Trading Scheme. In the much smaller, voluntary market, individuals, companies, or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, electricity use, and other sources. For example, an individual might purchase carbon offsets to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel. Many companies offer carbon offsets as an up-sell during the sales process so that customers can mitigate the emissions related with their product or service purchase (such as offsetting emissions related to a vacation flight, car rental, hotel stay, consumer good, etc.).\n\n\nAs shown in the figure below, carbon dioxide emissions are constantly increasing, which makes more and more people realize the importance of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. This voluntary market has prompted project developers to create technological innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Since trading of voluntary carbon offsets first took off in the late 2000\u2019s, voluntary carbon projects have helped to reduce, sequester, or avoid over 435.7 MtCO2e\u2013equivalent to not consuming over one billion barrels of oil. These projects are supported by companies, individuals and governments purchasing carbon offsets.\n\n\n\ud835\uddd4\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf8 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddee \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude01: <https://www.360marketupdates.com/enquiry/request-sample/20270758>\n\n\nThere are two markets for carbon offsets.

Much depends on the direction of the economy as well as the cost of zero-carbon generation technology. A robust, growing economy releases significantly more emissions than a slower growth one. Additionally, the cost-prohibitive nature of carbon technology reduces the adoption rate.\n\n\n***See also: \u201c[Extreme Heat Brings Climate Into Focus, Carbon Markets Rally](https://www.etftrends.com/climate-insights-channel/carbon-markets-rally-global-heatwaves/)\u201c***\n\n\nCarbon Markets Play Pivotal Role in U.S. Emissions Reductions\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo what does that have to do with carbon markets? Quite a bit, as it turns out. Carbon markets in California and the North East (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative) are structured in a way that it becomes increasingly cost-prohibitive to emit greenhouse gases. As more supportive policy rolls out in the U.S., the regulated markets stand to benefit.\n\n\nIn an environment where greater reductions are needed, the costs of carbon allowances are likely to rise in the coming years. In California, the market already has a mechanism in place to raise the carbon allowance floor price every year. It creates an opportunity for investors to capitalize on the transition to net-zero emissions in the U.S.\n\n\nKraneShares offers two ways to gain exposure to the U.S. carbon market.\n\n\nThe\u00a0**[KraneShares California Carbon Allowance ETF (KCCA)](https://etfdb.com/etf/KCCA/?__hstc=169852158.ceffbab8df9391c28d301b980bb08059.1691021893276.1691021893276.1691021893276.1&__hssc=169852158.1.1691021893276&__hsfp=1274709576#etf-ticker-profile)** offers targeted exposure to the joint California and Quebec carbon allowance market.

The market can help us channel much-needed finance to drive climate action, conserve vital ecosystems, and support sustainable development and livelihoods in local communities. However, one of the leading challenges for companies is differentiating high-integrity carbon credits in a crowded marketplace. New integrity guidance is shedding light on how companies can make the highest impact investments to complement their sustainability commitments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhy is the conversation around carbon credits so complex and polarized? For good reason. For too long, the market has operated without overarching guidance to ensure these carbon credits truly deliver on their climate promises, and don\u2019t cause any unintended harm to people or nature. Intense media scrutiny has revealed bad actors and flawed practices, which has bruised public confidence in the market\u2019s capacity for positive climate action.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe integrity of carbon credits is essential for the voluntary carbon market to be effective in addressing climate change. Low-quality or fraudulent carbon credits could undermine the market and prevent it from delivering real climate benefits, not to mention potentially harm communities or ecosystems.\u00a0\n\nLuckily, the voluntary carbon market is at a potential turning point. New guidance and resources released this year aim to ensure carbon credits deliver the positive impacts they promise. Recently, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) released its Core Carbon Principles (CCPs), an anticipated set of principles that set a global threshold to define what a high-integrity carbon credit looks like.\u00a0\n\nWhat should companies and carbon credit buyers take away from the CCPs?\u00a0\n\n**1. Already in 2023, the ICVCM will use its Assessment Framework to assess whether types of carbon credits meet the high-integrity CCP criteria, and will start issuing CCP labels to credits in the market.** To qualify for the CCP label credits must fund projects to reduce and remove emissions that are:\u00a0\n\n* \u200b\u200b\u200bCompatible with a **transition to net zero.** The framework rules out projects that lock in fossil fuel emissions or technologies.\n* **Permanent.** Projects must compensate for any reversals that happen within 40 years.\n* **Additional.** Reductions and removals would not have happened without carbon credits.\n* **Robustly Quantified.** The emissions impact must be measured conservatively to minimize the risk of overestimation.\n* All new projects will have to put in place **robust social and environmental safeguards** that deliver **positive sustainable development impacts.**\n\n**2. CCP compliance is a starting point, not a finish line, for high integrity.** Further effort is needed to ensure the voluntary carbon market delivers on its potential for climate action, while benefiting communities and ecosystems. While the CCP\u2019s can serve as a starting point for identifying credit quality, it will still be up to companies and carbon credit buyers to continue due diligence efforts to ensure their carbon credits deliver the true impact they claim. \n\n**3. The next phase of the voluntary carbon market\u2019s journey must focus on inclusion,** particularly for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Indigenous People and Local Communities are key partners in the VCM, and should be involved in decision-making and governance processes as partners, not solely beneficiaries. Some progress has been made to consult and engage Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities in multi-stakeholder efforts like the ICVCM. However, these efforts must be strengthened to ensure IPLC stakeholders hold power in processes to develop standards and governance to drive higher integrity.\n\n**4. We need a clear pathway for high-quality credits from natural climate solutions (NCS)** to direct private sector finance to these integral climate projects. High-quality NCS projects such as tropical forest conservation are critical to providing the near-term mitigation needed to meet global climate goals. As the ICVCM continues to refine the CCPs, it is critical that ICVCM appropriate market signals on high quality NCS credits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHowever, the Integrity Council is not the only group making progress in guiding the way to high integrity. There are a number of resources available to help companies and other carbon credit buyers identify high-integrity carbon credits and make transparent claims around those credits.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese include:\u00a0\n\n* [The Carbon Credit Quality Initiative (CCQI)](https://carboncreditquality.org/): The CCQI is a global initiative that sets standards for carbon credit quality. The CCQI\u2019s standards cover a range of factors, including the project\u2019s environmental benefits, social and economic impacts, and governance. Users can explore the score of a carbon credit type using CCQI\u2019s interactive scoring tool to evaluate it across multiple quality considerations.\n* [The Tropical Forest Credit Integrity (TFCI) guide](https://tfciguide.org/): Eight norm-setting and Indigenous organizations produced the TFCI to help companies differentiate tropical forest credits by impact, quality, and scale. This resource is designed to provide companies with guidance on what high-quality tropical forest carbon credits look like so that they can participate in the voluntary carbon market with confidence and integrity.\n* The Voluntary Carbon Market Initiative\u2019s (VCMI) Claims Code of Practice: The recently updated VCMI Claims Code is a set of guidelines for making credible claims about the climate benefits of carbon credits. The Claims Code lays out a step-by-step process for making claims and identifies a set of consistent claims that companies can make with carbon credits. VCMI requires that companies purchase CCP-labeled carbon credits to back their climate claims, when these CCP-labeled credits become available.\n* The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi): The SBTi is an organization that develops standards for, and validates, science-aligned corporate climate targets. The SBTi strongly recommends that companies go above and beyond internal emissions reductions to engage in \u201cbeyond value chain mitigation\u201d (BVCM), including through the purchase of high-integrity carbon credits. The SBTi recently concluded a public consultation to guide their approach to BVCM, and will produce additional guidance on corporate BVCM approaches later this year.\n\nAll of these should be part of a buyer\u2019s consideration and due diligence process when using carbon credits in their climate strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe need for carbon credit quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market is clear. By using the resources and guidance that are available, companies and other carbon credit buyers can help to ensure that they are investing in high-quality carbon credits that truly achieve their climate goals and make a real difference for the climate.\u00a0\n\n*Want more info?

Co-benefits include additional environmental, economic, or social benefits while SDGs are specific types of co-benefits. For example, an entity looking to reforest/afforest land has the possibility to generate environmental co-benefits through providing new habitats for animal and insect species (SDG15: Life on Land). Additionally, an entity could introduce a social co-benefit by hiring a higher proportion of women to plant trees (SDG5: Gender Equality).\n\n\n**Are Voluntary Carbon Markets Beneficial?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nVCMs help major polluters offset GHG emissions and create innovative ways to solve the climate crisis. An [article](https://www.hsbc.com/insight/topics/the-vital-role-of-voluntary-carbon-markets) by HSBC argues that \u201cthe voluntary carbon market can be an incredible force for good that can help us accelerate the transition to a net zero economy.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe force of good that VCMs can offer is providing offset solutions to major polluting industries. For instance, the VMC [Verra](https://verra.org/) has issued over 1.1 billion verified carbon credits consisting of over 2,000 project activities around the world and has been used in over 88 countries. A large sector that emits GHG is transportation. [Verra](https://registry.verra.org/app/search/VCS/Registered) has created a project activity standard where entities can be issued carbon credits through installation of electric vehicle charging stations.\n\n\nAs VCMs adapt and refine standards, they provide incentive for government, industry, and individuals to change behaviour and promotes innovation for our global emissions to reach net zero.\u00a0\n\n\n***You might also like:*** [***Is Carbon Offset a Form of Greenwashing?***](https://earth.org/is-carbon-offset-a-form-of-greenwashing/)\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) incentivize project developers to reach net zero through reduction, avoidance, or removal of greenhouse gases (GHG) and promote co-benefits and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The summary presents information without expressing a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "VCMs have experienced obstacles in the past but have become more refined, with improved transparency and carbon reduction standards.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The improvement in transparency and standards suggests a positive development in VCMs."}, {"summary": "The Paris rulebook provides a framework for VCMs to establish project activity standards and transparency between project developers and VCMs.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The establishment of project activity standards and transparency is viewed as positive for VCMs."}, {"summary": "VCM registries, such as Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), Climate Action Reserve (CAR), American Carbon Registry (ACR), and Gold Standard, set competitive applicability conditions and must be complied with throughout the crediting period.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The summary states information without expressing a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "VCMs encourage project activities that include co-benefits and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), providing additional credits for their inclusion.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The promotion of project activities with co-benefits and SDGs is viewed as positive for VCMs."}, {"summary": "VCMs help major polluters offset GHG emissions and offer innovative solutions to the climate crisis, such as creating project activity standards for electric vehicle charging stations.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "VCMs are seen as a force for good by helping offset GHG emissions and promoting innovative solutions for the climate crisis."}, {"summary": "VCMs provide incentives for government, industry, and individuals to change behavior and promote innovation in reaching net zero emissions.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The provision of incentives for behavior change and innovation in emissions reduction is seen as positive for VCMs."}], "semantic_commentary": "VCMs incentivize GHG reduction with transparent standards and co-benefits.", "sentiment_score": 0.7142857142857143, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions systems and policies (Voluntary carbon markets) that aim to remove carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions companies committing to reducing their carbon footprint and incentivizing net zero emissions."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, specifically the obstacles, transparency, standards, registries, and incentives provided by Voluntary carbon markets."}]}, {"source": "University City Review", "link": "https://ucreview.com/voluntary-carbon-offsets-for-forestry-market-strategic-assessment-south-pole-group-3degrees-first-climate-markets-ag-natureoffice-gmbh/", "title": "Voluntary Carbon Offsets for Forestry Market Strategic Assessment \u2013 South Pole Group, 3Degrees, First Climate Markets AG, NatureOffice GmbH \u2013 University City Review", "content": "\n![](https://ucreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1.png)\n\n\nMarketQuest.biz as of late produced a research report titled, **Voluntary Carbon Offsets for Forestry Market** that speaks about potential development openings that exist in the worldwide market.

In conjunction with other laws advancing clean energy and electric vehicles, the cap-and-invest program targets 45% emissions reductions below 1990 levels by 2030, 70% reductions by 2040, and 95% reduction by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Contract details\n\n\n\nThe Washington CFP futures contract physically delivers credits that the Washington Department of Ecology issued through the Washington Fuel Reporting System Credit Bank and Transfer System, the companies said.\n\n\nWashington launched its Clean Fuel Standard Jan. 1, as the third state, after California and Oregon, to implement a market-based GHG emissions reduction program for transportation fuels, setting an emissions reduction target of 20% (based on 2017 levels) by 2034, according to the statement.\n\n\nThe WCA Specific Vintage futures contract is also physically delivered and \"enables market participants to make or take delivery of specific vintages that meet their compliance needs under the Washington carbon 'Cap-and-Invest' program,\" the statement said.\n\n\nSince the launch of WCA futures and options contracts, more than 8,200, equal to 8.2 million WCAs, have traded on Nodal Exchange, with open interest rising to more than 3,500 lots, it said.\n\n\nThe WCA Vintage Specific futures contracts join the portfolio of North American listed carbon products on Nodal Exchange including the California Carbon Allowance, California Carbon Allowance Vintage Specific, California Carbon Offset futures, and Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative futures and options, Nodal said.\n\n\n\"The new Washington contracts continue to illustrate the evolution of the North American environmental markets,\" said Paul Cusenza, Nodal Exchange's CEO.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Nodal Exchange and IncubEx are launching Washington Carbon Allowance Vintage Specific futures and Washington Clean Fuels Program futures contracts to meet the demand in the state's environmental markets.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "No sentiment expressed."}, {"summary": "The contracts are scheduled for launch on Aug. 11 pending regulatory review.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "No sentiment expressed."}, {"summary": "The growth in the WCA market and customer feedback prompted the launch of these contracts.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Customer interest and market growth are positive indicators."}, {"summary": "Washington state's second cap-and-trade auction raised over $557 million for clean transportation, climate resilience, and environmental justice projects.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The auction's success in raising funds for important initiatives is positive."}, {"summary": "The auction included the sale of current and future vintage allowances.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "No sentiment expressed."}, {"summary": "The settlement price for the current auction allowances triggered a future auction.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "No sentiment expressed."}, {"summary": "The cap-and-invest program aims to combat the climate crisis by requiring large emitters to obtain allowances for greenhouse gas emissions.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The program's goal of reducing emissions is positive."}, {"summary": "The Washington CFP futures contract and WCA Specific Vintage futures contract offer delivery of credits and compliance needs under the Cap-and-Invest program.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "No sentiment expressed."}, {"summary": "Since the launch of WCA futures and options contracts, over 8,200 contracts have traded on Nodal Exchange.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The high number of contracts traded indicates market interest and activity."}, {"summary": "The addition of the new Washington contracts underscores the growth of North American environmental markets.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The growth of environmental markets is seen as positive."}], "semantic_commentary": "Nodal Exchange and IncubEx launch Washington carbon futures contracts.", "sentiment_score": 0.5, "classifications": null}, {"source": "CarbonCredits.com", "link": "https://carboncredits.com/icvcms-new-framework-raising-the-bar-for-carbon-credits/", "title": "ICVCM's New Framework: Raising the Bar for Carbon Credits", "content": "The Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) released the long-awaited framework that provides guidance on defining what makes carbon credits of high quality, which can help boost the credibility of the [voluntary carbon market (VCM)](https://carboncredits.com/what-is-the-voluntary-carbon-market/).\u00a0\n\n\nICVCM\u2019s Assessment Framework is part of their [Core Carbon Principles (CCPs)](https://carboncredits.com/the-core-carbon-principles/) published last March.

The growing criticism over some carbon offset projects caused a sharp decline in market liquidity and carbon prices.\u00a0\n\n\nNature-based [carbon credit prices](https://carboncredits.com/carbon-prices-today/) (NGEO), in particular, are largely impacted.\n\n\n[![Nature Based Carbon](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20523%20477'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![Nature Based Carbon](https://carboncredits.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Nature-Based-Carbon.jpg)](https://carboncredits.com/carbon-prices-today/)\n\n\nBut with various initiatives introduced, carbon credit prices started to recover slowly. As per S&P Global Commodity Insights\u2019 Platts assessment, nature-based credit prices (Platts CNC) recovered from a record low of **$1/mtCO2e** in May to **$2.45/mtCO2e** in July. S&P Global data suggested that prices for the same credit reached an average of $9.55/mtCO2e last year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n![carbon credit prices S&P global Platts CNC](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201169%20625'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![carbon credit prices S&P global Platts CNC](https://carboncredits.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/carbon-credit-prices-SP-global.jpg)\n\nMany industry experts hope that this development will inspire more carbon removal and reduction efforts by bringing certainty to VCMs. But for a carbon credit to earn a CCP label, it has to go through two assessment levels.\u00a0\n\n\n* ### Program Level\n\n\nThis assessment framework and procedure were first released alongside the CCP guidelines. A dedicated \u201c[Assessment Platform](https://icvcm.org/assessment-platform/)\u201d is part of this second release specifically designed for crediting programs applying for CCP eligibility.\u00a0\n\n\nThe ICVCM refers to these programs as a \u201cstandard setting program that registers mitigation activities and issues carbon credits\u201d. Established programs are the Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry, and Verra\u2019s Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).\n\n\n* ### Carbon Credit Category Level\n\n\nThis is the newly released assessment guidance but the framework doesn\u2019t define yet what a \u2018Category\u2019 means. The Integrity Council will form a Categories Working Group (CWG) tasked to finalize the definition based on data gathered from rating agencies and publicly available information.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe CWG will recommend which categories must be prioritized for approval, which ones need further assessment, and which carbon credits don\u2019t deserve the CCP label.\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to the framework, carbon credits must support carbon projects that [align with net zero, additionality, permanent, and robustly quantified](https://icvcm.org/assessment-framework/).\u00a0\n\n\nThe goal of the framework is to ensure that the highest quality carbon credits prevail and get premium prices. The assessment process is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n![ICVCM assessment process](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20926%20510'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![ICVCM assessment process](https://carboncredits.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ICVCM-assessment-process.jpg)\n\nSome carbon crediting programs and standards are revisiting and making some changes in their methodologies.\n\n\nFor instance, the world\u2019s leading carbon registry, VCS, has been improving the quality of its forest carbon credits. The mostly used crediting program will finalize its [REDD+](https://carboncredits.com/what-is-redd-development-issues-and-solutions/) methodology by the last quarter of this year.\u00a0\n\n\nQuality Issues Remain, Framework to Strengthen\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhile some improvements are happening in the market, some experts still warn that quality issues of projects continue to persist.\u00a0\n\n\nOthers say that these efforts from ICVCM and similar initiatives aren\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d that can instantly resolve the issue of quality. Some say that the growing scrutiny of the VCM highlighted significant failures of the market to deliver at a project level. This has clearly impacted the supply of carbon credits as reported by S&P Global for different projects.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n![supply of carbon credits S&P](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201176%20630'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![supply of carbon credits S&P](https://carboncredits.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/supply-of-carbon-credits-SP.jpg)\n\nChart from S&P Global Commodity Insights\nStill, as major initiatives focus on the quality of the credits circulating in the market, improvements will happen soon. The Integrity Council will start forming various multi-stakeholder working groups to make things clear and strengthen the framework.\n\n\nThe [carbon market governance](https://carboncredits.com/carbon-credits-market-governance-and-initiatives/) body will also keep on updating its guidelines and frameworks over time. That means incorporating new developments, technological advances, and lessons learned into the updated version of the framework.\u00a0\n\n\nThe release of this initiative comes after the [VCMI launched its Claims Code of Practice](https://carboncredits.com/vcmi-claims-code-credible-carbon-credits/) just recently. It\u2019s a separate guideline seeking to make the demand side of the VCM more credible. The Code will help guide companies in using carbon credits to voluntarily offset their emissions.\n\n\nBoth VCMI and ICVCM aim for the same thing: to bring integrity to the VCM. They\u2019re also currently working to create an [integrated market integrity framework](https://carboncredits.com/vcmi-icvcm-market-integrity-framework/) aimed at improving carbon offset quality.\u00a0\n\n\nThe ICVCM will start announcing CCP-Eligible programs and CCP-Approved categories later this 2023, making CCP-labeled credits available for buyers before the year ends.\n\n\nWill this new threshold for quality bring prices of carbon credits up to premium? That\u2019s something to watch out for in the market once the CCP-labeled credits are up and running.\u00a0\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) has released a framework that defines high-quality carbon credits, aiming to boost the credibility of the voluntary carbon market (VCM).

Many discussions about becoming carbon neutral have been lately geared toward carbon credits and markets. Some calling it a potential gold rush for agriculture. However, the carbon market can be very confusing to understand.\n\n\n\n### **What is a carbon credit?**\n\n\nA carbon credit allows the credit\u2019s owner to emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. One credit allows for the emission of one ton of greenhouse gasses.\n\n\n\n### **How does one receive a carbon credit?**\n\n\nThe main ways to receive carbon credits are to capture or reduce carbon emissions. Examples of ways farmers are receiving carbon credits are by planting trees, removing land from production, and perhaps the talked about in the dairy industry is adopting methane digesters. Adopted practices need to be the right fit for each dairy farm. Methane digester may not be the right fit for smaller farmers because of the higher start-up cost and low energy produced. However, improving soil health and adopting different manure application techniques may be a good fit for smaller farms.\n\n\n\n### **What is the market for carbon?**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, two different markets exist. While both use commodity pricing for credits, they are structured differently. The first is the voluntary carbon market. The voluntary market is a global market in which companies or organizations can purchase carbon credits to meet environmental goals set by their industries or partners.\n\n\n\nThe other market is the compliance carbon market. The compliance carbon market is policy-driven. Companies may purchase credits to meet regional, state, national, or international emission requirements. For example, an organization that produces carbon below its threshold can sell its additional credits to a company that produces above its enforced emissions requirement. The compliance market would operate somewhat similar to a milk quota system.\n\n\n\n### **What to consider before entering a carbon market?**\n\n\nThe first thing that needs to be considered is reducing carbon emissions or capturing carbon as the best fit for the farm. Some practices can be costly, so we need to know how these practices will pay off in the long run. We also need to explore the different markets. Contracts, acreage limits, payments, and carbon emission verifications differ between the markets. These types of questions should all be answered before entering a market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The dairy industry is working towards becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and adopting new practices to lower carbon emissions on farms.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The dairy industry is actively taking steps to reduce carbon emissions, which is a positive move towards sustainability."}, {"summary": "Carbon credits allow the owner to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, with one credit allowing for the emission of one ton of greenhouse gases.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The information provided is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Farmers can receive carbon credits by capturing or reducing carbon emissions through various practices such as planting trees, adopting methane digesters, and improving soil health.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "By adopting these practices, farmers can contribute to reducing carbon emissions, which is a positive environmental impact."}, {"summary": "There are two markets for carbon credits: the voluntary carbon market and the compliance carbon market.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The information provided is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Before entering a carbon market, farmers need to consider factors such as the cost-effectiveness of emissions reduction practices and understanding the differences between the markets in terms of contracts, payments, and verification processes.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The information provided is neutral and does not indicate any positive or negative sentiment."}], "semantic_commentary": "This article is relevant as it discusses how farmers can receive carbon credits by adopting practices to lower carbon emissions on farms.", "sentiment_score": 0.4, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions companies committing to reducing their carbon footprint and purchasing carbon credits."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon and carbon credits."}]}, {"source": "Mondaq", "link": "https://www.mondaq.com/india/renewables/1349078/contextualizing-carbon-credit-trading-in-india", "title": "Contextualizing Carbon Credit Trading In India - Renewables - India", "content": "\nThe previous note discussed the administrative apparatus related\nto India's Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023 (the\n\"**CCTS**,\" and the final version, the\n\"**Final CCTS**\"), as notified on June 28 by\nIndia's [Power Ministry](https://powermin.gov.in/en/content/overview-2)\n(\"**MoP**\") in consultation with the Bureau\nof Energy Efficiency (\"**BEE**\"),\ncollectively representing the central government\n(\"**CG**\") in this regard. Given the wider\necosystem of integrated energy markets, in this note, we analyze\nthe scheme as a whole \u2013 and especially in the context of\nglobal decarbonization initiatives, including in connection with\npast and present templates related to energy savings and trading\nmechanisms, both Indian and international.\n\n\n### The CCTS: Background\n\n\nWhile the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 (the \"**EC\nAct**\") was [first amended in 2010](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/19050/1/theenergyconservationamendmentact2010srch.pdf) (the \"**2010\nAmendment**\") for the purpose of expanding upon the\nscope of the original legislation, a market-based regulatory\nframework \u2013 known as 'Perform, Achieve and Trade'\n(\"**PAT**\") \u2013 was [established](https://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/PAT%20Rules%2C%202012%281%29.pdf) soon thereafter with the aim of\nreducing the specific energy consumption\n(\"**SEC**\") in energy-intensive\nindustries.\n\n\nAs briefly described in the previous note, PAT involves the\ntrading of certifications related to excess energy savings (such\nenergy saving certificates, \"**ESCerts**\").\nThus, when a 'designated consumer'\n(\"**DC**\") overachieves its SEC targets in a\ngiven compliance year (such overachieving DC, a \"**DC\n1**\"), ESCerts are issued to it for free, reflecting\nthe difference between the CG-notified target and the actual SEC\nachieved by the DC 1. On the other hand, a DC that fails to reduce\nits SEC to the extent notified (such underachieving DC, a\n\"**DC 2**\") is required to purchase ESCerts\nfrom a DC 1 equivalent to the quantum of shortfall, failing which\nthe DC 2 may face penalties under the EC Act.\n\n\nThe Final CCTS is somewhat similar to PAT in design. This is\nunsurprising since \u2013 as discussed later in the note \u2013\nthe BEE's recent proposals about structuring an Indian carbon\ncredit trading framework have stemmed from its own past experience\nunder PAT and the EC Act \u2013 especially after the 2010\nAmendment. Further, given the lessons stemming from, and perceived\nshortcomings with respect to, PAT, the CCTS may eventually subsume\nexcess ESCerts (along with other instruments) by converting them\ninto carbon credit certificates (\"**CCCs**,\"\nand such converted CCCs, \"**C-CCCs**\").\n\n\nMeanwhile, PAT's design resembles a 'cap-and-trade'\nmechanism (\"**CAT**\"), somewhat like the [EU's](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en#a-cap-and-trade-system) emissions trading scheme\n(\"**ETS**\") \u2013 the world's [first](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32003L0087). However, an ETS may also be designed as\na 'baseline-and-credit' system\n(\"**BAC**\").\n\n\n### CAT and BAC\n\n\nA CAT framework requires a fixed upper limit (*i.e.*, a\n'cap') on the volume of greenhouse gas\n(\"**GHG**\") emissions in one or more\neconomic sectors. Tradable permits \u2013 where each allowance\nrepresents the right to emit a certain volume of emissions \u2013\nare either auctioned or freely distributed. While PAT deals with\ntrading in ESCerts, the state government of Gujarat [signed](https://epic.uchicago.in/gujarat-is-planning-a-cap-and-trade-market-for-carbon-emissions/) a memorandum of understanding last year\nto implement a subnational CAT carbon market \u2013 India's\nfirst.\n\n\nMeanwhile, under a BAC system, there is no fixed limit on\nemissions, but polluters can earn 'credits' by reducing\ntheir emissions beyond a 'baseline'. Such earned credits\ncan then be sold to those that need or want them \u2013 whether in\norder to comply with applicable regulations, or to meet stakeholder\ndemand in terms of managing/reducing their carbon footprint.\n\n\nHowever, PAT differs from traditional CAT systems because it\nsets *intensity*-based energy targets. Among major emerging\neconomies like India, the policy emphasis is on intensity\n(*i.e.,* the volume of emissions per unit of gross domestic\nproduct (\"**GDP**\")) \u2013 rather than on\nan absolute cap. This altered stance stems from a concern that hard\nquantitative limits are likely to inhibit economic growth. While an\nabsolute quantity-linked cap has the advantage of predictability\nwith respect to emission levels, an intensity-based target allows\nsuch emissions to fluctuate with flux in economic development.\n\n\n### Intensity and EE\n\n\nPAT differs from regular ETS models since it involves a\nframework based on energy-intensity\n(\"**EE**\") rather than on emissions itself.\nThus, PAT is more of an EE trading system, rather than a plain\nvanilla ETS. For instance, ESCerts are not denominated in terms of\nGHG reductions \u2013 even while the latter remains the *de\nfacto* trading unit of most carbon markets around the\nworld.\n\n\n### Carbon Pricing\n\n\nIn general, carbon pricing aims to curb GHG emissions by placing\na fee on emissions and/or by offering incentives for emitting less.\nThe price signal thus created is expected to shift consumption and\ninvestment patterns. While government-mandated carbon taxes or a\ntraditional ETS are obvious manifestations of putting a price on\ncarbon, PAT is an example of *implicit* pricing.\n\n\nSuch implicit carbon pricing strategies involve targets or\nobligations which must be met by surrendering a tradeable commodity\nat the end of a stipulated period, or by participants undertaking\ncompliance measures within such period. Accordingly, these\ninstruments can complement an ETS, or may prepare an evolving\nmarket for an eventual ETS rollout.\n\n\nIndeed, other countries too have sought to integrate carbon\npricing instruments with pre-existing trading systems based on\ntargets and/or obligations related to EE (*e.g*., PAT) or\nthe use of renewable energy (\"**RE**\"). In\nIndia, for example, the Electricity Act, 2003, as amended, requires\ncertain categories of obligated entities (such as state-owned\nelectricity distribution companies\n(\"**discoms**\")) to purchase a minimum\npercentage of their electricity from RE sources. This requirement\nis known as renewable purchase obligations\n(\"**RPO**\"). More specifically, when such\nobligated entities face procurement-related issues due to\nintermittent RE supply across states or on account of variations in\nquality, RE certificates (\"**RECs**\") may be\nused to meet RPOs. Thus, RECs are market-based tradeable\ninstruments that represent the environmental attributes of RE.\n\n\n### CCMs and VCMs\n\n\nThe other way to distinguish between energy markets is through\nthe prism of compliance. For instance, compliance carbon markets\n(\"**CCMs**\") consist of sovereign\nauthorization and mandatory implementation. On the other hand,\nvoluntary carbon markets (\"**VCMs**\") are\ndriven by demand from those that aim to offset their GHG emissions\n\u2013 including on account of corporate 'net zero'\ncommitments. Thus, for example, BAC schemes are often voluntary,\nallowing for the purchase and sale of carbon credits among\ncorporate entities. Since VCMs function independently of CCMs, the\ncredits issued in the former cannot be used to meet the legal\nand/or regulatory obligations imposed by the latter.\n\n\nAs described later in the note, it appears that, over the past\ncouple of years, the BEE has intended to focus on developing VCMs\nfirst, before integrating India's compliance regime with global\nCCMs.\n\n\n### Compliance and Voluntary Mechanisms under the CCTS\n\n\nAs discussed in the previous note, the [draft](https://powerline.net.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mail-dated-27-03-2023-to-Industry-Association-reg-CCTS.pdf) CCTS (the \"**Draft\nCCTS**\") released on March 27, 2023 had contemplated\nboth a compliance and a voluntary regime. However, the Final CCTS\nmentions only a compliance mechanism.\n\n\n**Compliance Regime**\n\n\nSince specific targets and timelines need to be provided for\nseparate industries under the compliance regime, it is expected\nthat eventual CCC trading in this regard will take [some time](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/063023-indias-national-carbon-market-to-seek-links-with-international-registries).\n\n\n**Voluntary Regime**\n\n\nAlthough the Final CCTS makes no mention of a voluntary regime,\npursuant to a [gazette notification](https://moef.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Draft-GCP-Notification-Inviting-Comments-27062023.pdf) dated June 26, 2023, the\nMinistry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change\n(\"**MoEFCC**\") proposed the Draft Green\nCredit Programme Implementation Rules, 2023 (\"**Draft\nGreen Credit Rules**\") \u2013 which seek to establish\na domestic voluntary market mechanism called the 'Green\nCredit' program.\n\n\nThis Green Credit program is expected to encourage private\nsector industries, companies and other stakeholders to fulfill\ntheir respective obligations with the aim of generating green\ncredits and pursuing acquisition activities.\n\n\n**The Green Credit Program**\n\n\nAccording to the Draft Green Credit Rules, green credits may\narise from a range of sectors and entities. In essence, such green\ncredits will be tradable outcomes and are intended to act as\nincentives. Further, green credits are proposed to be made\navailable for trading on a domestic market platform.\n\n\nAn environmental activity that generates green credits may have\nclimate co-benefits, such as reduction or removal of carbon\nemissions. An activity that generating green credits under the\nGreen Credit program may also get carbon credits from the same\nactivity under the carbon market.\n\n\n**BEE's Past Proposals**\n\n\nIn March 2021, the BEE had issued a [request for proposal](https://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender_document/RfP%20-%20Development%20of%20Blueprint%20for%20the%20Design%20of%20a%20Voluntary%20Energy%20Efficiency%20Market%20in%20India%20.pdf) in respect of developing\na blueprint to design a voluntary EE market in India (the\n\"**RFP**\"). A year later, in a [draft blueprint for stakeholder consultation](https://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/publications/files/NCM%20Final.pdf)\n(\"**Proposal 1**\"), the BEE proposed three\nphases towards the eventual adoption of a CAT system for\nIndia's proposed ICM.\n\n\nSubsequently, in October 2022, the BEE conducted a stakeholder\nconsultation to get inputs on a revised proposal\n(\"**Proposal 2**\") where the proposed\nthree-phase transition in Proposal 1 was reduced to two phases.\n\n\n### The RFP\n\n\nAlthough the RFP stated that that the BEE was exploring the\npossibility of tapping into additional demand for ESCerts by\nlinking PAT with international carbon market programs (with the\nhope that such linkages would support ESCert trading prices), it\ndid admit that the actual surplus in ESCert supply would require\nthe enhancement of corresponding demand under PAT itself. However,\nthe BEE also acknowledged that in its current form, PAT left out\nnearly 50% of energy savings potential from industry (especially\namong micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)) and did not\ninclude residential households or other large energy users either\n(*e.g*., urban local bodies). Thus, in the RFP itself, the\nBEE expressed its intent of extending PAT to a VCM framework for\nthe purpose of tapping into initiatives of non-state and\nsub-national actors (including companies, investors, financial\ninstitutions, municipal authorities, and [states](https://beeindia.gov.in/sites/default/files/publications/files/SEEI%202020%20Report%20Final_0.pdf)) under the auspices of the existing EC\nAct \u2013 albeit with modifications, such as those eventually\nwitnessed in the 2022 Amendment.\n\n\nIn this regard, the RFP also referred to the untapped potential\nof carbon pricing, anticipating that a BEE-driven market could\ngenerate the necessary confidence necessary to overcome entry\nbarriers \u2013 such as the lack of consistent and clearly defined\nprice-setting benchmarks \u2013 for the purpose of encouraging new\nentrants to join a widened Indian VCM.\n\n\n### Proposal 1\n\n\nThe BEE's Proposal 1 comprised three distinct phases.\n\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n\nThe proposed first phase under Proposal 1 sought to increase VCM\ndemand by opening it up to buyers other than DCs. Further, this\nphase was intended to include fungibility in the sense that ESCerts\nand RECs would be allowed to trade as carbon offsets alongside\nCCCs.\n\n\nThe BEE's reasons for championing fungibility at this stage\nby attracting voluntary buyers (and sellers, according to future\nrequirement) appears to be based on past learning from PAT. While\nPAT did reduce emissions significantly in its first few cycles, a\ncontinued surplus in ESCerts supply has nevertheless plagued such\nmarket. Coupled with muted demand, this has led to sustained low\nprices. However, PAT is premised on the assumption that the price\nof ESCerts will incentivize DCs to focus on EE. Accordingly,\ncurrent circumstances may eventually deter DCs from investing in\ntechnologies based on EE \u2013 unless the underlying\ndemand-supply mismatch is addressed. Thus, given that several\nnon-DC entities already have stated GHG reduction commitments, and\nfor the purpose of generating extra demand for the surplus ESCerts\nissued under PAT, the first phase of Proposal 1 sought to provide\nnon-DC entities and/or voluntary buyers/sellers with an opportunity\nto trade in ESCerts by tapping into the readily-available interest\namong private sector entities.\n\n\nFurther, voluntary commitments with respect to companies\n(including in India) are typically denominated and/or expressed in\nterms of reducing CO2 emissions \u2013 and *not* on\nimproving EE. Thus, variation in the unit of trading may itself\nlead to compatibility issues. In that respect, the proposed\nfungibility associated with ESCerts was intended to lead to\ninternational participation, in conjunction with increased adoption\nof the underlying instrument.\n\n\nFurther, the BEE expected demand to stem from five principle\nsources: (i) voluntary buyers, (ii) existing DCs which are part of\nPAT, (iii) designated state agencies which may be permitted to\nparticipate in India's VCM, (iv) discoms with RPO obligations,\nand (v) the aviation sector as a whole \u2013 given global\nconcerns about growing emissions from the airlines industry, as\nwitnessed through schemes such as the Carbon Offsetting and\nReduction Scheme for Aviation (CORSIA) developed by the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which requires\nairlines and other aircraft operators to offset growth in CO2\nemissions.\n\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n\nThe second phase under Proposal 1 aimed to increase the supply\nof carbon credits in the voluntary market by opening it up to\nsellers other than DCs. This may involve the registration and\nvalidation of emission reduction projects \u2013 which can\nsubsequently issue emission reduction units or carbon credits.\n\n\n**Phase 3**\n\n\nIn the third phase, the voluntary market was expected to evolve\ninto a mandatory CAT system, in which DCs would be required to\nrestrict their emissions within a pre-fixed cap.\n\n\n### Proposal 2\n\n\nIn Proposal 2, the first two phases suggested in Proposal 1 were\nmerged into one.\n\n\nIn effect, the Indian carbon market\n(\"**ICM**\") would comprise CCCs as a\ntradeable commodity, with each CCC equal to one tCO2e. Further,\nCCCs could be further be divided into C-CCCs, mandatory CCCs\n(\"**M-CCCs**\") and offset CCCs\n(\"**O-CCCs**\"). ESCerts, RECs, and surplus\nClean Development Mechanism (\"**CDM**\")\ncredits will be converted to carbon credits or offsets as\nC-CCCs.\n\n\nHistorically, the CDM has allowed emission-reduction projects in\ndeveloping countries to earn certified emission reduction\n(\"**CER**\") credits. These CERs can be\ntraded and sold, and in turn, may be used by industrialized\ncountries to a meet a part of their emission reduction targets\nunder the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n\nMeanwhile, obligated entities under the ETS mechanism would\ngenerate and trade M-CCCs, and the O-CCCs would be generated as\npart of the offset scheme under the ICM.\n\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n\nThe first transition phase (2023-25) under Proposal 2 was\nproposed to focus on the fungibility of ESCerts and RECs into\noffsets. Entities with surplus ESCerts and RECs may choose to\nconvert them into C-CCCs. Based on criteria such as fuel mix and\nadditionality, an entity-specific conversion factor was proposed to\nbe stipulated for the purpose of converting surplus ESCerts into\noffsets.\n\n\nMeanwhile, PAT was intended to remain in force in the first\nphase of Proposal 2. This phase would include the development of\nthe offset market; guidelines related to monitoring, reporting, and\nverification (MRV); setting up a registry; and a comprehensive\ngovernance structure for both offset and compliance markets, in\nconsultation with relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n\nIn the second phase of Proposal 2 (2026 onwards), a fully\nfunctional national ETS was proposed to be launched involving\nsectors and entities that were already part of PAT. Obligated\nentities would be provided with a GHG emission intensity target,\nand M-CCCs would be allocated accordingly. Based on performance in\nrespect of EE, these entities could choose to abate or trade in\nemissions.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\nGiven that detailed procedures with respect to the Final CCTS\nmay be outlined over time, it is possible that such scheme details\nwill subsequently capture BEE's earlier proposals \u2013\nincluding in connection with a phased transition.\n\n\n*This insight/article is intended only as a general\ndiscussion of issues and is not intended for any solicitation of\nwork.

Glenn Youngkin\u2019s proposed regulation to withdraw Virginia from the regional carbon market known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\n\n\nThe Southern Environmental Law Center filed the notice of appeal in Richmond City Circuit Court on July 31 on behalf of Appalachian Voices, the Association of Energy Conservation Professionals, Faith Alliance for Climate Solutions and Virginia Interfaith Power and Light. The filings indicate the action will be taken against the State Air Pollution Control Board and the Department of Environmental Quality, as well as its director, Michael Rolband.\n\n\n\u201cThroughout this process, the administration has brushed aside serious questions concerning their lack of authority to take this action, and ignored the thousands of Virginians who have steadfastly opposed this misguided process,\u201d said SELC Senior Attorney Nate Benforado. \u201cWe are disappointed it has come to this but look forward to presenting our arguments to the court.\u201d\n\n\nRGGI is an 11-state market that aims to incentivize electricity producers to generate fewer carbon emissions by requiring them to purchase allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere. There is a limited number of allowances available that decreases each year. In Virginia, regulated electric utilities \u2014 which account for roughly three-quarters of power grid emissions \u2014 are allowed to pass on the costs of allowances to ratepayers.\n\n\nVirginia joined RGGI in 2021 after legislation known as the [Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB1027) passed the Democratic-controlled General Assembly in 2020.\n\n\nThe appeal aims to challenge regulatory actions to withdraw Virginia from RGGI approved by the air board and DEQ. Youngkin has sought to remove Virginia from RGGI since his election, calling the allowance costs utilities are allowed to recover from customers a \u201chidden tax\u201d that isn\u2019t resulting in lower emissions.\u00a0\n\n\nIn June, [the State Air Pollution Control Board voted to adopt the regulation](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/07/virginia-air-board-approves-withdrawal-from-regional-carbon-market/), which was presented by Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles and requires Virginia to leave the market at the end of the year.\u00a0\n\n\nThe notice of appeal is a legal formality that one party must file in court to notify the opposing party that a lawsuit is coming. The actual lawsuit, which will detail the environmental groups\u2019 legal arguments in more detail, will be filed within 30 days in Fairfax County Circuit Court, according to a news release.\u00a0\n\n\nBenforado has [argued in front of the air board](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/07/virginia-begins-official-withdrawal-from-regional-carbon-market/) that the previous administration of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam found that Virginia\u2019s participation in RGGI requires the director of the DEQ to oversee the state\u2019s participation in the program. But in a [Joint Commission on Administrative Rules](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/20/legislative-commission-objects-to-withdrawal-from-regional-carbon-market/) meeting, Voyles argued that the use of the word \u201cauthorize\u201d in the relevant provision of state code leaves participation up to the discretion of the DEQ director.\u00a0\n\n\nRepublicans [attempted to legislatively withdraw from RGGI this past session](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/24/senate-bill-to-withdraw-virginia-from-carbon-cap-program-voted-down/), but Senate Democrats shot the proposal down.\n\n\n\n> [Youngkin completes review of new regs to pull Virginia out of carbon market by year\u2019s end](https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkin-administration-completes-review-of-new-regs-to-pull-virginia-out-of-carbon-market-by-years-end/)\n> \n> \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the lawsuit will result in a stay, or pause, of the regulatory proceedings to have Virginia leave RGGI by the end of year. [The regulation was published in the Virginia Register](https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkin-administration-completes-review-of-new-regs-to-pull-virginia-out-of-carbon-market-by-years-end/) Monday and is slated to go into effect Aug. 30 following a 30-day public comment period.\n\n\nIn a statement Monday, Voyles reiterated that RGGI participation is an \u201cunnecessary tax.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Office of the Attorney General confirmed the State Air Pollution Control Board has the legal authority to take action on the regulatory proposal using the full regulatory process \u2014 and the Board voted to do just that \u2014 furthering Virginians\u2019 access to a reliable, affordable, clean, and growing supply of power,\u201d Voyles said. \u201cVirginians will see a lower energy bill in due time because we are withdrawing from RGGI through a regulatory process.\u201d\n\n\nIn Virginia, RGGI costs previously equated to an average $2.39 monthly fee tacked on to Dominion residential customers\u2019 bill. That fee was suspended last year in light of Youngkin\u2019s withdrawal push; however, regulators recently allowed Dominion to recover the costs the company accrued during the suspension and will accrue during the remainder of the year, [resulting in a $4.44 average monthly fee](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/26/dominion-gets-approval-to-charge-customers-again-for-carbon-market-participation/) for residential customers that will go into effect this September.\n\n\nThe costs of RGGI compliance for Appalachian Power Company customers weren\u2019t immediately known last month, because the utility includes those costs as part of a broader fee for environmental projects, but spokeswoman Teresa Hall said the utility has spent roughly $796,000 since 2021 for RGGI compliance costs to cover its natural gas-fueled Clinch River Plant.\n\n\nIn addition to Virginia utilities, third-party generators, which are responsible for roughly 30% of emissions from the state\u2019s electric grid, must purchase allowances.\u00a0\n\n\nOverall, revenues from the allowance purchases are returned to the states. In Virginia, over $500 million has been earmarked for flood resiliency and energy efficiency programs under rules outlined in state law.\n\n\nOther environmental groups like the Sierra Club, Wetlands Watch, League of Conservation Voters and Natural Resources Defense Council have also argued against Virginia\u2019s withdrawal from the program.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThe legal case for this attempted repeal of the RGGI law is wobblier than an intoxicated bowling pin,\u201d said Walton Shepherd, Virginia policy director for the NRDC, during the last air board meeting.\n\n\n[GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE](/subscribe)\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Environmental attorneys have filed notice of a legal challenge against Republican Gov.

The Alberta Government has signalled its commitment to maintain the integrity of the \u201cMade in Alberta\u201d carbon pricing and emissions trading system under the TIER Regulation.\n\n\nThis commitment is echoed by the leadership of the Canadian oil and gas industry to reduce emissions and commit to net-zero emissions from oil sands operations by 2050, in addition to leading carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) initiatives and clean energy technology[[5]](#5).\n\n\nThe next court date for the Amberg charges is set for August 15, 2023 in the Alberta Court of Justice, Calgary.\n\n\n**Background: Alberta\u2019s Carbon Pricing and Emissions Trading System**\n\n\n*Federal Regime \u2013 GGPPA*\n\n\nIn 2018, the Federal Government enacted the *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act* (GGPPA)[[6]](#6) as one element of Canada\u2019s strategy to satisfy its commitments under the Paris Agreement, specifically to achieve a 40-45% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 2005 levels by 2030, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\nThe GGPPA establishes a fuel charge on the distribution of carbon-based fuels, and a carbon pricing mechanism for certain industrial GHG emissions that are not subject to the fuel charge.\u00a0 To the extent a province establishes an alternative scheme to reduce emissions that satisfies the \u201cminimum national standards\u201d set out in the GGPPA, such province is exempt from the GGPPA regime.\n\n\n*The Alberta TIER System*\n\n\nAlberta was the first province in Canada to implement legislation regulating GHG emissions and requiring large industrial emitters to report their emissions and take emissions reduction actions.\u00a0 The current regime consists of the TIER Regulation and EMCRA, which established a carbon pricing and emissions trading system, which is a \u201cMade in Alberta\u201d system that reflects Alberta\u2019s industry and efficiencies, and that satisfies the standards set out in the GGPPA.\n\n\nThe TIER system generally regulates facilities that emit 100,000 tonnes or more of GHG carbon dioxide equivalent\u00a0(tonnes CO2e) per year in 2016 or any subsequent year. Facilities can also elect to \u201copt-in\u201d to the TIER Regulation if they compete against a TIER-regulated facility or if they emit 2,000 tonnes CO2e or more of emissions and are in an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed sector such as oil and gas, landfills and food processing, or if they register multiple facilities as an aggregated facility. Facilities regulated by the TIER system are exempt from the federal fuel charge under the GGPPA.\n\n\nA facility regulated under the TIER system is required to satisfy compliance obligations based on the facility\u2019s annual emissions benchmarks which are determined from historical emissions amounts or high performance of the most emissions-efficient facilities. There are four compliance obligation options:\n\n\n1. Reduce on-site emissions.\u00a0 The facility may reduce its on-site emissions, such as implementing process changes to reduce the facility\u2019s energy consumption or converting a sequestration credit into a capture recognition tonne.\n2. Emission offset credits.\u00a0 The facility may submit emission offset credits, which are generated by projects that have voluntarily reduced their GHG emissions under an approved emission offset protocol (there are currently 19 protocols in effect), and are verified by a qualified third party in accordance with the Standard for Validation, Verification and Audit. Alberta\u2019s *Standard for Greenhouse Gas Emission Offset Project Developers*[[7]](#7)\u00a0requires submission of project information and the credits can then be listed on the [Alberta Emission Offset Registry](https://alberta.csaregistries.ca/GHGR_Listing/AEOR_Listing.aspx) for purchase by other regulated facilities. Each registered credit represents one tonne of CO2e that a facility can purchase and use to effectively offset the number of excess tonnes of CO2e it produces in a given year, relative to the applicable benchmark. Examples of projects generating emissions offsets include the capture, transportation and injection and ultimate sequestration of CO2 into an enhanced oil recovery scheme and the capture and conservation of methane that is normally vented.\n3. Emission performance credits (EPCs). The facility may submit EPCs, which are generated when the facility has reduced its GHGs emissions below the applicable emissions benchmark.\u00a0\u00a0 EPCs are revocable licenses which can be banked, transferred or retired by a facility to meet its emissions reduction requirements (one tonne of CO2e reduced is equal to one EPC).\u00a0 In order for a facility to generate EPCs, it must submit compliance reports and be issued EPCs from the Alberta Government on the [Alberta Emission Performance Credit Registry](https://alberta.csaregistries.ca/GHGR_Listing/EPC_Listing.aspx).\n4. TIER fund credits. The facility may purchase TIER fund credits at a prescribed price in the amount of the \u201cexcess\u201d emissions above the applicable benchmark (at a price of $65/tonne for 2023, which will increase in $15 increments until reaching $170/tonne in 2030).\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the TIER system depends, in large part, upon compliance by regulated facilities with the obligations set out under EMCRA and the TIER Regulation, including in particular the accurate measurement and reporting of emissions.\u00a0 In this regard, the Alberta Government has established a comprehensive regime governing such measurement and reporting.\n\n\n*Compliance with the TIER System: Investigation and Enforcement Tools*\n\n\nThe EMCRA and the TIER Regulation include broad regulatory investigative and enforcement tools to ensure compliance by regulated facilities, and the EMCRA may conduct investigations and audits, issue compliance orders, seek court orders, register charges against land, recover their enforcement costs, impose administrative penalties, and, in certain cases, pursue offences and penalties.\n\n\nUnder the EMCRA, anyone who knowingly provides false or misleading information; provides false or misleading information; fails to provide information required to be provided; knowingly contravenes a compliance order; contravenes a compliance order; fails to provide information or assistance to an inspector or investigator, or interferes with an inspector or investigator or the director exercising their powers and carrying out their statutory duties commits an offence. Upon conviction, an individual may be fined up to $100,000 or face imprisonment for a period of not more than two years or both fine and imprisonment, and a corporation may be fined up to $1,000,000. Penalties for subsequent convictions can be expected to be higher. Other than in respect of the \u201cknowingly \u201coffences, anyone charged will be able to assert the defence of due diligence. The legislation also grants the Court the power upon conviction to impose a number of related orders such as restitution orders.\n\n\nSimilar to Alberta\u2019s other environmental legislation, the EMCRA provides for liability of directors, officers, or agents of a corporation where the corporation commits an offence and such person authorized, assented to, acquiesced in or participated in the commission of the offence, whether or not the corporation is actually prosecuted for or convicted of the offence.\n\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n\nThe charges laid under the EMCRA follow a trend of increased enforcement of environmental regulatory legislation, including in relation to misleading environmental and ESG claims and \u201cgreenwashing\u201d. They also signal the importance of compliance with EMCRA and the TIER Regulation.\n\n\nEntities owning or operating regulated facilities are advised to adopt a compliance program with the objective of ensuring compliance with EMCRA and the TIER Regulation. An effective compliance program reduces the risk of violations and contraventions, lessens the likelihood of reputational harm from them and assists in establishing a due diligence defence to any charges in court. Such a program is also typically be considered by regulators when considering whether to proceed against a corporation and/or its directors and officers, whether to propose resolution terms or a plea bargain and, if convicted, it would also assist in lessening the fine ultimately imposed.\n\n\nSuch a program should include among other the following elements:\n\n\n* Know the Facility(ies): Assess facilities and the application of the TIER Regulation (which continue to evolve) to such facilities, including applicable quantification protocols and standards.\n* Policies and Procedures: Implement a comprehensive or updated Environmental Management System with appropriate management oversight to reflect TIER obligations (including emissions reporting), which includes procedures and policies applicable to the facility, such as regular inspections of the facility, good record-keeping and housekeeping practices, and ongoing training for personnel, including directors, officers and agents.\n* Reporting Obligations: Understand the TIER Regulation and reporting obligations based on the chosen compliance obligation option(s) and establish appropriate reporting structures and protocols.\n* Third Party Assurance Providers: Verify the qualifications of third party assurance providers to ensure that the TIER Regulation\u2019s technical qualification requirements are met. Importantly, the interim provisions which allowed someone to be eligible to be a third party assurance provider if they had technical knowledge and were recognized as a registered professional have now expired. As of June 30, 2023, only verification bodies accredited to the ISO Standard 14065:2013 by the Standards Council of Canada, or another approved accreditation organization[[8]](#8) are eligible.\n* Document Retention: Understand document retention requirements under the TIER Regulation, which requires that entities retain applications, records, reports and information associated with emission offsets, cost containment designation, opt-in facilities and forecasting.\n* Inspections and Investigations: Retain a qualified environmental consultant and legal counsel to advice on the response to and the management of the investigation, inspection and risk management, including the formulation and assertion of legal defences such as due diligence and under the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.\n* Public Statements: Ensure that all public statements relating to environment and sustainability matters, including emissions and compliance with the TIER system, are not misleading and are based on credible verifiable data and reporting under EMCRA and the TIER Regulation and in compliance with any applicable securities laws.\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\nMcMillan is authoring a number of articles to assist clients in navigating the quickly developing legal landscape surrounding ESG and Climate Change resilience.\u00a0 Among other developments, regulators have confirmed that regulating emissions, ESG-related matters and combatting greenwashing will be a top priority in 2023.\u00a0 For an overview on recent ESG litigation developments in Canada and the US, see our earlier bulletins in our ESG series, including: [Green or Grey: Regulators Target Greenwashing, Misleading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Claims](https://mcmillan.ca/insights/green-or-grey-regulators-target-greenwashing-misleading-environmental-social-and-governance-esg-claims/) and [ESG Class Actions and Other Lawsuits \u201cSustainable\u201d into 2023](https://mcmillan.ca/insights/esg-class-actions-and-other-lawsuits-sustainable-into-2023/).\n\n\nFor more information about these developments or compliance with the TIER system, or if you have any questions on the applicability of the TIER system, or if you are facing an actual or potential non-compliance or regulatory investigation under the TIER system please contact the authors of this bulletin or your regular McMillan contact.\n\n\n[1] See\u00a0the [Information on Behalf of His Majesty the King](https://www.alberta.ca/assets/documents/epa-amberg-corp-and-olga-kiiker-sworn-information.pdf)\u00a0setting out the charges laid on May 3, 2023.  \n\n[2] [Emissions Management and Climate Resilience Act](https://kings-printer.alberta.ca/1266.cfm?page=2019_133.cfm&leg_type=Regs&isbncln=9780779843916), SA 2003, c.

The data will allow them to instantly locate the most carbon-efficient alternative.\n\n\n\n\n![Emissions](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![Emissions](https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Untitled-design-32-1.jpg)\n\nRepresentation Image\nFrom January 2024, shipping will be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). As part of this, shipping owners, charterers, and traders will need to mitigate potential additional shipping costs by seeking more carbon-efficient fleets. According to analysis from LSEG and Siglar Carbon, choosing carbon-efficient ships and route planning could reduce potential carbon emission costs for traders and charterers by as much as 50%.\n\n\nFabrice Maille, Head of Shipping & Agriculture at LSEG, comments:\n\n\n\n> \u201cWhen trading physical commodities, it is vital to have the right data and insights when evaluating the different options for cargo programmes to cut emissions. For traders and charterers, this could halve carbon emissions costs.  \n> \n> \u201cThere are already ongoing efforts to decarbonise focusing on aspects such fuels but given how quickly the ETS will come into force, planning carbon-efficient voyages is low-hanging fruit logistically.\u201d\n> \n> \n\n\nSigmund Kyvik, Siglar Carbon CEO, comments:\n\nPopular Stories Right now[Why Nautical Mile and Knot Are The Units Used at Sea?](https://www.marineinsight.com/guidelines/nautical-mile-knot-units-used-sea/)[Bill Of Lading in Shipping: Importance, Purpose, And Types](https://www.marineinsight.com/maritime-law/what-is-bill-of-lading-in-shipping/)[Top 20 World\u2019s Largest Container Ships in 2023](https://www.marineinsight.com/know-more/top-10-worlds-largest-container-ships-in-2019/)\n\n> \u201cOur carbon solutions already play a pivotal role in driving decarbonisation in the shipping industry. Through LSEG, we can capitalise on its unique position and scale of its Workspace platform to bring our insights to a wider audience.\u201d\n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to the Siglar Carbon index, a ship carrying gasoline between Europe and the USA via the TC2 route \u2013 one of the most commonly traded tanker routes \u2013 would emit approx. 1,800 tonnes of CO2 on the round voyage. The most efficient alternative would emit approx. 1,200 tonnes, and the related EU ETS cost would be approx. 25,000 USD.\n\n\nThe least efficient choice would emit 2,500 tonnes with a EU ETS cost of 50 000 USD. In 2026, once the EU ETS is fully phased in the same cost would add up to approx. 63,000 and 125,000 USD, respectively.\n\n\nFor ship owners, Siglar analysis shows that a charterer or owner who is active in the European short-sea market with 20 ships could generate approximately 100,000 tonnes of CO2-eligible emissions a year. At a carbon cost of USD 100 per EUA, this would mean an added cost of USD 10 million per year once the EU ETS is fully phased-in. Charterers and owners engaged in larger vessels could easily generate ETS eligible emissions close to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year with an annual carbon cost of 50 million USD.\n\n\n*Press

steel sector invests USD 100 billion in coal-based steel plants, despite low profitability, overcapacity and carbon commitments \u2013 Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air", "content": "\nChina currently produces more than 1 billion tons of crude steel annually, which is more than half of the world\u2019s steel production. The dominance of the coal-based blast furnaces-basic oxygen furnace (BF\u2013BOF) method in the Chinese steel sector, along with its large scale, presents significant challenges for decarbonisation efforts. Coal is burned to strip oxygen from the iron ore and this process generates substantial carbon emissions. The low carbon transition of the Chinese steel sector is essential for China\u2019s carbon neutrality target by 2060, as well as for decarbonising the global steel sector. Deep decarbonisation would require substantial investments in zero-emission steelmaking technologies, as well as the early retirement of carbon-intensive facilities yet the sector\u2019s persistent overcapacity and thin profitability is complicating the transition to cleaner steelmaking methods.\n\n\nThe Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA)\u2019s latest briefing on the steel sector in China reveals that China\u2019s crude steel output has declined since 2021 due to output control by the government and the decline in downstream demand. However, new investments in iron and steelmaking capacity have so far not adjusted to the new reality. The expansion of the Chinese steel industry demonstrates a close correlation with the nation\u2019s economic development. Excessive investments have persistently inundated the industry, transforming the customary cyclical and short-term overcapacity situation into a protracted and persistent overcapacity issue, referred to as structural overcapacity.\n\n\nThe consequences of this overcapacity significantly impact the sector\u2019s profitability because steel firms find it challenging to operate sustainably at levels below approximately 80% capacity utilisation.\n\n\n![](https://energyandcleanair.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-35-1024x738.png)![](https://energyandcleanair.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-35-1024x738.png)\n\nThere is an urgent need to align investments in new production capacity in the steel sector with the goal of peaking and reducing CO2 emissions before 2025.\n\n\n### **Key findings**\n\n\n* Chinese steel firms are making significant investments in new, coal-based steelmaking capacity. Companies received approvals from provincial governments for 384.3 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of new ironmaking capacity, and 425.9 Mtpa new steelmaking capacity from 2017 until the first half of 2023. On average, approximately 30 Mtpa steelmaking capacity was approved every six months, which is almost equal to the total steel capacity of Germany. These new approvals are under the capacity replacement policy, which requires a larger quantity of existing capacity to be retired for all new capacity that is added.\n* Approximately 90% of crude steel production in China is using coal-based blast furnace\u2013basic oxygen furnace (BF\u2013BOF) routes, wherein coal is used to extract oxygen from iron ore in BF. This method generates significant carbon emissions, thereby contributing substantially to the high carbon emission intensity in China\u2019s steel sector. However, new iron and steel capacity is continuously dominated by the BF\u2013BOF route. Blast furnaces (BF) account for about 99% of the new ironmaking capacity and basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) account for 70% of the new steelmaking capacity approved in 2017\u20132023 H1. That is to say, at least one-quarter of China\u2019s existing steelmaking capacity has been renewed to further lock in carbon intensive production during their 40-year lifespan.\n* In spite of the \u2018dual carbon\u2019 goal pledge announced in 2020, during 2021\u20132023 H1 there was a total 119.8 Mtpa BF and 76.6 Mtpa BOF approved. To meet the 2060 carbon neutrality goal requires early retirement of carbon-intensive steelmaking facilities. Therefore, the new BF\u2013BOF approved after 2020 alone would result in nearly USD 100 billion (CNY 700 billion) in stranded assets.\n* We also saw promising progress on shifting investments into facilities that are less carbon-intensive. New proposed electric arc furnace (EAF) projects significantly increased in 2021\u20132023 H1, with a total capacity of 52.5 Mtpa approved. EAF steelmaking is promoted under the latest capacity replacement policy. The share of EAF in the newly announced steelmaking capacity grew to 30-40% from 2021. Several non-BF projects with a total capacity of 4.7 Mtpa, applying incremental technology or zero-emission technology in the ironmaking process also received approval.\n* By 2025, nearly all new permitted iron and steel projects will commence operations. Through these replacements, approximately 40% of China\u2019s iron and steelmaking capacity will be renewed. China\u2019s steel capacity replacement policy requires steel firms to present both \u201cexit\u201d capacity and \u201caddition\u201d capacity in the capacity replacement application. The exit capacity needs to be larger or equal to the addition capacity, which could ensure a net capacity reduction. However, in practice,\u00a0 effective operating capacity might increase, worsening the excess supply in the market. This is because some of the \u201cexit\u201d iron and steelmaking facilities have remained idle for years, and even though they are not a part of currently effective operating capacity, steel companies use these idle capacities as allocation to apply for new capacity approvals under the capacity replacement policy. In this case, when the new facilities commerce operation, the effective operating capacity will exhibit a net increase.\n* The majority, specifically 69%, of the new iron and steel projects development are spearheaded by private steel enterprises, followed by regional state-owned enterprises and central state-owned enterprises, accounting for 26% and 5%, respectively.\n\n\n### **Policy recommendations**\n\n\n* Include the steel sector in China\u2019s emissions trading system (ETS) within the 14th five-year-plan period, and the emissions trading system should shift from an intensity-based allocation to an absolute cap.\n* Limit new investments in blast furnace capacity and speed up the adoption of electric arc furnaces and hydrogen-based steelmaking technology, to peak CO2 emissions from the iron and steel sector before 2025.\n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "China's steel sector is crucial for decarbonisation efforts due to its large scale and dominant use of coal-based blast furnace methods, which generate significant carbon emissions.

Three of the most prominent examples include:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Predictive models to fill ESG disclosure gaps**: Machine learning, a type of AI that takes inspiration from processes in the human brain, offers the potential to improve the accuracy of ESG metrics.These metrics are in high demand: While 88% of asset owners in a Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing [survey](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/sustainable-investing-funds-opportunities) deemed ESG reporting important in selecting an asset manager, only 39% of asset managers offered this reporting and disclosure.[1](#F1) Meanwhile, among corporates, only 35% of listed companies globally disclose at least some of their greenhouse gas emissions\u2014an increasingly critical risk metric for investors.[2](#F2)\n\n\n  \n\nPredictive modeling, which relies on machine learning techniques and uses publicly available data, is helping investors fill these gaps in sustainability disclosures. Currently, when estimating greenhouse gas emissions, investors often calculate an industry average for companies that do not disclose emissions, or use simple linear extrapolation to model emission values based on parameters disclosed by companies. By contrast, machine-learning models can identify additional parallels in the data, based not only on industry but factors such as location, revenue breakdown and types of products and services. Identifying these data relationships may result in more accurate estimates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Natural-language processing to gauge sentiment and risk:** Natural-language processing (NLP) gives investors the ability to analyze thousands of media and other sources of information daily, eliminating the shortcomings of manual data collection and risk assessment, including subjectivity and limited capacity. This approach can be used to identify companies with controversial ESG practices\u2014such as allegations of human rights abuses or corruption and bribery\u2014that companies may not report themselves but could be material information for investors. NLP tools can be used to detect and collect online criticisms and allegations in real time, providing investors with key information on public perception and its potential impact on company stock prices.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**Satellite technologies to assess environmental risks:** AI-powered satellite sensors can determine companies\u2019 exposure to physical risks or negative environmental impacts, helping investors make better decisions. These solutions can quickly and accurately analyze a large number of inputs, such as infrared images, to detect patterns.\n\n\n  \n\nCurrently, ESG ratings agencies use imagery of deforestation and reforestation to assess the quality of voluntary carbon offsets. Another powerful application, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) monitors leaks of methane, a greenhouse gas more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere. Launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in 2022, MARS will analyze information gathered by worldwide mapping satellites to detect concentrated areas of methane emissions and attribute them to a specific source. This data will be made public, giving investors the opportunity to directly engage with a company on its strategy for reducing methane emissions.[3](#F3)\n\n\n  \n\n\u201cUsing satellite imagery for sustainability-related geospatial analysis is increasingly an area of focus for Morgan Stanley\u2019s Sustainable Insights Lab, our team of data scientists that uses advanced analytics to help develop evidence-based sustainable investment strategies across asset classes,\u201d says Slovik. \u201cThe real-time ability to better understand, for example, how rising sea levels may increase flood risk for low-lying coastal real estate or how a company\u2019s physical assets may be exposed to wildfire damage helps the firm and our clients make better-informed decisions.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n### **Understanding the Risks**\n\n\nWhen exploring AI tools, ESG investors should consider potential risks, including data privacy and security. Since AI models require a wide range of data that could include personally identifiable and sensitive information, there are concerns that AI can be used to track private behavior, which could even become publicly accessible through reverse engineering.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere are also risks related to the potential lack of reliability and accountability from AI-generated information. Despite the flurry of publicity surrounding generative AI, information generated from large language models may not be accurate, or transparent in its sourcing. Without safeguards ensuring transparency and accountability, AI tools could be used to spread discriminatory language or even promote misinformation that harms the integrity of the global financial system. Necessary safeguard mechanisms include outlining clear responsibility for the outcomes of models and data, as well as the ability and willingness to share models\u2019 logic and outputs. Bias can also creep into the system. If training data is not representative of a population and is tainted by algorithmic or human biases, the output data may be biased too.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulation will be important in helping reduce these risks. \u201cGovernments are starting to craft legislation on the use of the technology, albeit at a much slower pace than the innovation and development of AI models and use cases,\u201d says Jamie Martin, Head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s EMEA Sustainability Office. \u201cLeading the charge is the European Union, which is close to passing one of the world's first laws[4](#F4) governing artificial intelligence. Proponents of the EU legislation expect it to lead the way for other global governing bodies to follow.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n### **Questions for Investors**\n\n\nInvestors should consider the following questions when assessing AI tools for sustainable investing:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**1) What problem is AI trying to solve?** \u201cBeing clear on the problem statement and the market size of the opportunity that is being addressed is paramount,\u201d says Sanghamitra Karra, Head of EMEA [Inclusive Ventures Group](https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-ventures-group) at Morgan Stanley. \u201cWhat is interesting and unique about the design and execution of the AI solution to solve this problem?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n**2) What data sets are being used?** An AI algorithm is only as good as the data used. Establish what data is available, what the unique advantages of the specific data set might be, and why the AI solution or company has the right to that data. Additionally, understand if the developers have already done the work to understand any bias in the data and address them when designing the tool.\n\n\n\n**3) What data and model governance mechanisms are in place?** Confirm that strong controls ensure safety and ethics. Reported and tracked instances of AI misuse has increased by 26 times since 2012.[5](#F5) Extra safeguards are needed for solutions in areas of special risk to society, such as healthcare, education, critical infrastructure, administration of justice and the use of sensitive personal data**.**\n\n\n\n**4) Why is this company the right owner of this solution?** \u201cInvestors should be wary of a company that describes itself as an AI firm for sustainability or sustainable investing but has an insufficient AI background or technical ability and experience to build solutions,\u201d Karra says. AI-powered solutions for sustainable investing should demonstrate the ability to scale with the proper management team.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Advancements in AI, including machine learning and natural language processing, can benefit sustainability-focused investors by helping them navigate companies\u2019 financial performance prospects and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article highlights the potential of AI to improve investors' ability to identify companies with strong ESG performance, mitigate risks, and shape portfolios that align with sustainability objectives."}, {"summary": "AI applications in sustainable investing include predictive models to fill ESG disclosure gaps, natural language processing to gauge sentiment and risk, and satellite technologies to assess environmental risks.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article presents different AI applications without explicitly expressing a positive or negative sentiment towards them."}, {"summary": "Investors should consider potential risks such as data privacy and security when exploring AI tools for sustainable investing.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The article highlights concerns about data privacy, security, and the reliability and accountability of AI-generated information, which could have negative implications for the integrity of the financial system."}, {"summary": "Investors should ask questions about the problem AI is trying to solve, the data sets being used, data and model governance mechanisms, and the expertise of the company offering the AI solution.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article suggests that investors should ask these questions without expressing a positive or negative sentiment towards the AI solutions."}], "semantic_commentary": "Advancements in AI can help investors consider ESG factors.", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article discusses advancements in AI that can help navigate companies' environmental factors."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions sustainable investing, which is related to carbon."}]}, {"source": "Innovation Origins", "link": "https://innovationorigins.com/en/europes-steel-industry-a-push-toward-green-steel/", "title": "Europe\u2019s steel industry: A push toward green steel - IO", "content": "\n\n![Author profile picture](https://innovationorigins.com/app/uploads/2023/01/IO_Team_Laio_Square.jpg)\n\n##### \nBy [Laio](https://innovationorigins.com/en/author/laio/)\n\n\n\n\nEurope\u2019s steel industry is spearheading the transition to low carbon emission steel production. With the introduction of innovative production processes and a range of new environmentally friendly products, the industry is taking significant strides towards sustainability. However, amidst these advancements, the green steel market faces a challenge in terms of standardization. Addressing this issue is among the top priorities on the European Commission\u2019s energy transition agenda. The upcoming implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is also anticipated to have a notable impact on steel imports, influencing their sources and prices.\n\n\n* Europe\u2019s steel industry is transitioning to low carbon production through new processes and environmentally friendly products.\n* The upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to generate over $80 billion in annual revenue by 2040.\n* The EU\u2019s Innovation Fund and state aid rules can support pilot decarbonization projects for clean steel.\n\nThe Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe development of the CBAM is intended to counterbalance carbon leakage, a situation that places countries with stringent carbon emission regulations at a competitive disadvantage due to imports from nations with less rigorous regulations. By imposing a carbon price on certain imported goods based on their carbon footprint, the CBAM seeks to equalise the competition. This mechanism will not only affect the steel industry but will also have implications for other sectors such as cement, aluminium, and fertilisers.\n\n\nThe CBAM has raised some concerns within the steel industry. Notably, fears about a potential increase in steel prices and the necessity for carbon accounting have been voiced. The absence of clear guidelines in the green steel market poses a significant challenge for companies attempting to comply with the CBAM. The lack of standardisation can make it difficult for steel producers to accurately measure and report their emissions, potentially resulting in increased costs or penalties.\n\n\n\n#### Support Us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-time donation\nMonthly\nEach quarter\nAnnually\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail address\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrency\\*AEDAUDBGNCADCHFCZKDKKEUR (\u20ac)GBP (\u00a3)HKDHRKHUFILSISKJPY (\u00a5)NOKNZDPHPPLNRONRUBSEKSGDUSD (US$)ZARAmount (\u20ac) \\*\n \n\n   \n  \n\n\n== Choose a payment method ==iDEALCardPayPal\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nI hereby authorize Media 52 B.V. to collect the amount shown above from my account periodically. \n\n\nI hereby agree to the [Privacy Policy](https://innovationorigins.com/privacy-policy/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal impact and revenue generation\n------------------------------------\n\n\nAccording to S&P Global Trade Atlas data and carbon price outlooks, the implementation of CBAM could generate over $80 billion per year by 2040. This significant revenue generation is expected to persuade other jurisdictions to consider adopting domestic carbon pricing policies to mitigate their long-term exposure. Countries such as Canada, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey are projected to be the leading contributors to CBAM-covered EU trade, accounting for over 40% of total exports to the EU between 2026 and 2040.\n\n\nGiven that the EU accounted for approximately 16% of total global imports in 2021, the impact of the CBAM is expected to be felt worldwide. The coverage of emissions by the EU CBAM certificate price could reach approximately 2.5% of global emissions from products destined for the EU market by 2040. This indicates the potential of the CBAM in driving global carbon pricing and stimulating decarbonisation.\n\n\nDecarbonising the Steel Industry\n--------------------------------\n\n\nThe steel industry is responsible for roughly 5% of CO2 emissions within the EU and 7% globally. For the industry to align with the EU\u2019s climate targets, the development and commercialisation of new low-CO2 technologies within the next decade are necessary. Presently, the EU steel industry is focusing on hydrogen-based steelmaking as a decarbonisation strategy, with several projects across Europe aiming to replace existing steel production processes with hydrogen-based direct reduction of iron.\n\n\n![](https://innovationorigins.com/app/uploads/2023/05/h2-green-steel.png)Swedish H2 Green Steel eliminates climate-damaging carbon by using green hydrogen in the direct reduction process of ironThe green hydrogen will power a new, cycle-oriented steel plant in Boden, northern Sweden. Operations are planned to start at the end of 2025.\nHowever, the production of low-CO2 steel is expected to be more expensive in the short-to-medium term, as costs are dependent on future prices of renewable hydrogen and electricity. Nevertheless, with a significant decrease in the costs of renewable hydrogen and an increase in the price of CO2 emissions, hydrogen-based steelmaking could become competitive with current steelmaking costs by 2050.\n\n\nInvesting in the future\n-----------------------\n\n\nResearch and development (R&D) investment is critical to support the development and deployment of low-CO2 steelmaking technologies. The recently launched Clean Steel Partnership aims to bring breakthrough technologies for clean steel production to large-scale demonstration by 2030, with estimated R&D investment needs up to 2030 amounting to \u20ac2.6 billion.\n\n\nMoreover, the EU\u2019s Innovation Fund, financed by auction revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System, and the carbon contracts for difference under the Innovation Fund will play crucial roles in supporting the demonstration of low-CO2 plants. State aid rules can further boost pilot decarbonisation projects, and given the growing evidence of market willingness to pay a green steel premium, the EU has the opportunity to be a leader in low-CO2 steel production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "summaries": [{"summary": "Europe\u2019s steel industry is transitioning to low carbon production through new processes and environmentally friendly products.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The industry is taking significant strides towards sustainability."}, {"summary": "The upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to generate over $80 billion in annual revenue by 2040.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The implementation of CBAM could generate significant revenue."}, {"summary": "The CBAM seeks to equalise competition by imposing a carbon price on certain imported goods.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The CBAM has both positive and negative implications for the steel industry and other sectors."}, {"summary": "Fears about potential price increases and the necessity for carbon accounting have been raised in relation to the CBAM.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The concerns raised indicate potential negative impacts and challenges for steel producers."}, {"summary": "The implementation of the CBAM is expected to have a global impact and generate significant revenue.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The CBAM is expected to generate over $80 billion per year by 2040 and have a significant global impact."}, {"summary": "The steel industry is responsible for a significant amount of CO2 emissions and is focusing on hydrogen-based steelmaking for decarbonisation.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The steel industry is addressing its environmental impact but faces challenges in cost and technology."}, {"summary": "Investment in research and development and the use of state aid rules are important for supporting the development of low-CO2 steelmaking technologies.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Investment and support from various sources can drive the development of low-CO2 steel production."}], "semantic_commentary": "Article is relevant to intent.\nSteel industry transitioning to low carbon production.\nCBAM expected to generate revenue.\nFears about price increases and carbon accounting.\nSteel industry focuses on hydrogen-based steelmaking for decarbonisation.\nInvestment in R&D and state aid support needed for low-CO2 steelmaking.", "sentiment_score": 0.42857142857142855, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions that Europe's steel industry is transitioning to low carbon production through new processes and environmentally friendly products."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions the upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is news about carbon."}]}, {"source": "InvestorsObserver", "link": "https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/qm-pr/6117997034261504", "title": "Carbon Capture And Storage Market to Surpass $4.3 Billion by 2030 Globally, at a CAGR of 10.6%, says Coherent Market Insights", "content": "\n\n\n Burlingame, July 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Growing need to reduce carbon emmissions from environment is driving growth of the carbon capture and storage market.
