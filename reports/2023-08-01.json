By Paul Kitagaki Jr.\nFor the first time, California\u2019s leading air regulator acknowledged major roadblocks to meeting its ambitious carbon emissions target for 2030, a goal the agency set just months ago in a sweeping plan to tackle climate change.\n\nThe hurdles revolve around the feasibility of carbon capture technologies and the state\u2019s flagship climate program, known as cap-and-trade. It\u2019s a tension poised to intensify as the California Air Resources Board navigates a transformation of the energy economy.\n\nCentral to the debate is the question of whether California should tighten the reins on industrial emitters by strengthening its cap-and-trade program, which established an emissions trading system aimed at cutting emissions while providing flexibility for industry.\n\nIn its 2022 [climate change roadmap](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/2022-sp.pdf), the agency placed heavy bets on emerging technologies to remove carbon pollution from the atmosphere, setting a target to reduce emissions across the economy to 48% below 1990 levels by 2030 - an increase from the previous 40%. \n\nBut Air Board staff now say those technologies may not be widely available in time. As a result, they say relying solely on cap-and-trade could drive carbon prices to unmanageable heights and push industrial polluters out of California. \n\nDave Clegern, an Air Board spokesman, emphasized the need to overcome carbon removal infrastructure challenges to attain the ambitious 48% reduction goal. \n\n\u201cIf those tools are not widely available by 2030 with a 48% target, then prices get very high in the program and that leads to leakage \u2014 production moving out of state to reduce emissions in state and comply with the program,\u201d Clegern said in a statement. \n\nHe asserted that California is still on track to achieve its lower, legally mandated target to reduce emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Clegern also hinted at the possibility of exploring alternative approaches to achieve the higher target. \n\nThese obstacles come as no surprise to climate experts who have long warned that California is at risk of missing its 2030 climate goals. In the past, the Air Board agency [faced criticism](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4656) for lacking a clear implementation strategy of its climate plan and relying on optimistic assumptions.\n\nThe cap-and-trade program itself has faced sustained criticism for not effectively curbing industrial emissions and burdening communities already plagued by high pollution levels. Under this program, the state sets a limit on emissions allowed from power plants, refineries and factories, which are then issued permits that can be bought, sold or traded.\n\nDanny Cullenward, a climate economist who serves as an advisor to the state, said the Air Board appears to be \u201claying the groundwork for a blame shift\u201d by conditioning the program\u2019s strengthening on carbon removal technologies. \n\n\u201cThis is how you begin to say, \u2018It\u2019s not our fault that we can\u2019t get there,\u2019\u201d Cullenward said. \u201c\u2019We are unable to do the things we want to do because somebody else didn\u2019t follow through.\u2019\u201d\n\nCritics including environmental justice advocates have voiced opposition to the Air Board\u2019s heavy reliance on nascent technologies such as [carbon capture](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article273962810.html) and storage and green [hydrogen](https://business.ca.gov/industries/hydrogen/), expressing skepticism about their feasibility.\n\nBut Air Board staff expressed confidence it could meet the ambitious 2030 target in its scoping plan until last week.\n\nAt a Thursday [workshop](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/nc-CapTradeWorkshop_July272023_0.pdf), deputy executive officer Rajinder Sahota questioned the viability of those exact technologies, according to several attendees. Meeting slides show that Sahota indicated that achieving the 2030 scoping plan target would necessitate several extraordinary feats. \n\nThey include a significant expansion of green hydrogen (462 times current levels) and removing 20 million tons of carbon dioxidefrom the atmosphere, amounting to an annual emissions reduction of 5%. For context, emissions only fell 9% during pandemic lockdowns. \n\nThe carbon capture and storage industry must also overcome significant pipeline permit challenges.\n\n\u201cImplicit in (Sahota\u2019s) comments was the possibility that we will not achieve it,\u201d said Michael Wara, a Stanford University climate policy expert who participated in the workshop. \n\nWara said it was the first time he saw agency staff appear to wrestle with implementation of their own climate goals. He raised the concern that inflated carbon prices would drive up costs for both industries and consumers, particularly Californians still driving gas vehicles who can\u2019t afford to buy electric.\n\nThe agency plans to make decisions on the future of cap-and-trade quickly, with members of the public having only three weeks to submit comments with full calculations of economic costs and benefits.\n\n\u201cToday was a day when ARB acknowledged how hard it will be to achieve the 2030 target,\u201d Wara said. \u201cThe target is really science based, and ARB is tasked with making that possible in the real world. That is hard.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published July 31, 2023, 5:00 AM.\n\n\n\n\n[![Profile Image of Ari Plachta](https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/89v0h8/picture276979848/alternates/FREE_480/ari_new.jpeg)](/profile/263065408)\n\n\n###### \n[Ari Plachta](/profile/263065408)\n\n\n\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/ariplachta)\n[email](mailto:aplachta@sacbee.com)\n[phone\n916-321-1374](tel:916-321-1374)\n\n\n\nAri Plachta is a climate reporter for The Sacramento Bee.

cars that pass its office.** \n\nCreative and technology group MSQ is working alongside climate solution company Ecologi to promote its latest carbon removal solution, Biochar.\n\nThe project removes the equivalent amount of greenhouse gasses produced by vehicles that pass MSQ\u2019s London offices from the atmosphere.\n\n \n\nThe \u2018Covent Carbon Capture\u2019 project uses specially created tech to capture vehicle emissions data from every car that passes by on the 10m stretch of road in one of the busiest areas in the UK.\n\nA test from earlier this year recorded that 1.4m vehicles passed the window in four months, capturing almost 1.5 tonnes of CO2, which Ecologi will remove from the atmosphere.\n\nMSQ will also implement this technology at several of its other global locations, and will also make the offer available to other businesses that want to remove the equivalent greenhouse gasses generated outside their own locations.\n\n \n\nLuke Cunningham, chief technology officer of MSQ\u2019s creative studio Brave Spark, says: \u201cThe Covent Carbon Capture project required an unconventional solution that exemplifies MSQ\u2019s focus on developing creative technologies to deliver innovation for our clients.\n\n\u201cThe most rewarding work has a meaningful impact, and the Covent Carbon Capture initiative helps contribute to MSQ's ongoing commitment to sustainability and raises awareness of carbon removal technology and its ability to help us become a net zero society.\u201d\n\nEcologi launched its biochar service earlier this year to help businesses fund carbon dioxide removal through biochar generation from waste biomass.\n\n \n\nLinda Adams, head of partnership at Ecologi, added: \u201cWe're excited to be part of this innovative project by MSQ, an organization working to reduce their own emissions through approved near-term Science-Based Targets.\n\n\"This project not only also serves to educate others on technological advancements within the voluntary carbon market and associated funding of climate action, but also sheds light on increased vehicle emissions in urban areas. We're proud to facilitate the funding of carbon removal in support of MSQ's climate action and wider decarbonization strategy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n[Creative](/creative)\n[Creative Works](/topics/creative-works)\n[Sustainability](/topics/sustainability)\n\n\n\n### More from Creative\n\n\n[View all](https://www.thedrum.com//creative)\n\n\n[![music video with download window](https://thedrum-media.imgix.net/thedrum-prod/s3/news/tmp/798481/wetransfer.png?w=640&ar=2:1&fit=crop&crop=faces,edges&auto=format)](/news/2023/07/31/wetransfer-drops-first-its-kind-interactive-music-video-british-dance-duo-jungle)\n[### WeTransfer drops \u2018first-of-its-kind\u2019 interactive music video for British dance duo Jungle](/news/2023/07/31/wetransfer-drops-first-its-kind-interactive-music-video-british-dance-duo-jungle)\nThe \u2018Back on 74\u2019 music video art is riddled with hidden concert tickets and artworks that viewers can download via WeTransfer\u2019s file sharing technology.\n\n\n[Continue reading](/news/2023/07/31/wetransfer-drops-first-its-kind-interactive-music-video-british-dance-duo-jungle)\n\n[![SKY - 02](https://thedrum-media.imgix.net/thedrum-prod/s3/news/tmp/349138/screenshot_2023-07-31_160435.png?w=640&ar=2:1&fit=crop&crop=faces,edges&auto=format)](/news/2023/07/31/idris-elba-plays-the-showman-he-takes-viewers-through-skys-celebrity-filled-ad)\n[### Idris Elba plays the showman as he takes viewers through Sky\u2019s celebrity-filled ad](/news/2023/07/31/idris-elba-plays-the-showman-he-takes-viewers-through-skys-celebrity-filled-ad)\nIt features the likes of Erling Haaland, Jack Grealish, Ella Toone, Lauren James, Lewis Hamilton, Ben Stokes, Emma Raducanu and Jon Rahm.\n\n\n[Continue reading](/news/2023/07/31/idris-elba-plays-the-showman-he-takes-viewers-through-skys-celebrity-filled-ad)\n\n[!['Let's all chip in' campaign from Adam & Eve DDB and McCain ](https://thedrum-media.imgix.net/thedrum-prod/s3/news/tmp/669468/lets_all_chip_in.jpg?w=640&ar=2:1&fit=crop&crop=faces,edges&auto=format)](/news/2023/07/31/mccain-taps-love-islands-ian-stirling-sustainability-campaign-and-tiktok-series)\n[### McCain taps Love Island\u2019s Iain Stirling for sustainability campaign and TikTok series](/news/2023/07/31/mccain-taps-love-islands-ian-stirling-sustainability-campaign-and-tiktok-series)\nThe chip-maker is targeting Gen Z with work that talks up its sustainability credentials. \n\n\n[Continue reading](/news/2023/07/31/mccain-taps-love-islands-ian-stirling-sustainability-campaign-and-tiktok-series)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Marketing can change the world.\n\n\n\n[![Follow Us On Twitter](https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-twitter-footer.svg)](https://twitter.com/thedrum)\n[![Follow Us On Facebook](https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-facebook-footer.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/thedrumpage)\n[![Follow Us On LinkedIn](https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-linkedin-footer.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thedrum)\n[![Follow Us On Instagram](https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-instagram-footer.svg)](https://www.instagram.com/thedrummag/)\n[![Follow Us On Youtube](https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-youtube-footer.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDrumReel)\n\n\n[About](https://www.thedrum.com/about-us)\n[Advertise with us](https://www.thedrum.com/media-solutions)\n[Calendar](https://www.thedrum.com/calendar)\n[Careers](https://apply.workable.com/the-drum/)\n[Contact](https://www.thedrum.com/contact)\n[Privacy](https://www.thedrum.com/privacy)\n[Terms & Conditions](https://www.thedrum.com/terms)\n[Sitemap](https://www.thedrum.com/about-us/sitemap)\n\n\n \u00a9 Carnyx Group Ltd 2022 | The Drum is a Registered Trademark and property of Carnyx Group Limited.

Carbon Offsets Outlook 2023\n=====================================\n\nRead full articleBloombergTue, August 1, 2023 at 4:20 AM GMT+12\u00b75 min read**NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / July 31, 2023 /** Bloomberg\n\nOriginally published on [bloomberg.com](https://pr.report/IYafOUQb)\n\nA turbulent year hasn't thrown off the long-term prospects for the carbon offset market, which could be valued at half a trillion dollars annually by 2050. Demand will rise into the billions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent within the next decade as companies work toward net-zero goals. Supply could increase nearly 60-fold depending on how carbon removal and nature-based solutions scale. If all offset types are allowed, the market will be oversupplied and prices will average just $18/ton out to 2050. Conversely, a removal-only market would increase this average to a massive $127/ton. A third scenario could see the market splitting in two, keeping prices reasonable but failing to direct investment to technology-based removal and the most impactful avoidance projects.\n\n**Long-term carbon offsets outlook 2023**\n\n[Access the report](https://pr.report/KPQ-STna)\n\n* Offset demand dropped in 2022: Corporations purchased and retired just 155 million carbon offsets in 2022, down from 161 million the previous year. The biggest driver was growing criticism of carbon offsets by investors and the media, tempering enthusiasm from buyers. Crypto companies, who bought over 18 million offsets on the Verra registry in 2021, were also forcibly removed from the market midway through the year for fears of catalyzing investment into low-quality projects, cutting out a big chunk of demand.\n* Offset supply rose slightly in 2022: Projects in 77 countries issued 255 million carbon offsets, up just 2% from 251 million in 2021. Avoided deforestation (REDD+) supply dropped 32%; major projects in Peru, Indonesia and Kenya received heaps of criticism and issued no offsets in 2022, as customers were wary of the reputational risk that could come from buying such credits. Reforestation and agriculture supply both rose in 2022 but it wasn't enough to counterbalance the drops seen elsewhere.\n* Companies will still need billions of offsets long term: Today's fluctuating demand is mostly classified as behavioral, meaning companies buy offset to differentiate products or satisfy customers. It's more responsive to prices and criticism, and BloombergNEF expects behavioral demand to drop from 181MtCO2e in 2023 to zero in 2050. It will be replaced by fundamental demand as companies work toward net-zero goals, increasing to 1.1GtCO2e in 2030 and 5.4GtCO2e in 2050. This demand is less price elastic and takes over long term.\n* Carbon offset supply will likely grow significantly: In a market that allows all offsets like those seen today, regardless of their sector and geography, supply will exceed 8GtCO2e by 2050. Over three quarters of this supply will come from nature-based avoided deforestation, reforestation and agriculture. Conversely, a market focused on removal would catalyze massive investment into technology like direct air capture (DAC) and bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in later years, pushing supply to 9.8GtCO2e in 2050.\n* This report forecasts carbon offset prices under three scenarios: The voluntary market scenario assumes nothing fundamentally changes about the offset market, with companies buying all types of offsets. The removal scenario assumes companies can only buy removal offsets to achieve net-zero goals. The bifurcation scenario has the market splitting in two, with a smaller market for expensive high-quality credits and a larger market for everything else.\n* Prices would be criminally low in the voluntary market scenario: Supply would be almost four times greater than demand in 2030. Offsets will cost just $13/ton at that point, valuing the market at a mere $15 billion. Prices rise to $35/ton in 2050, which is less than our previous outlook of $47/ton. This would be a disastrous outcome for the market - companies would continue to invest in cheap, low-quality offsets while sectors like DAC would fail to get needed investment. Issues thought to be largely tangential to the offset market today, such as the Russia-Ukraine War, the Brazil elections and compliance offset demand, could tighten the supply-demand balance and lead to much-needed rises in offset prices in this scenario.\n* A bifurcation scenario lives and dies by the definition of quality: Once stakeholders create such a definition, it's likely that the market diverges into a less liquid, more expensive market for high-quality offsets and a larger, cheaper market for everything else. BNEF estimates that such a market denoted by quality peaks at $38/ton in 2038, but would still be too cheap to incentivize investment into technology-based removal like DAC. A low-quality market would exacerbate many of the issues already seen in today's market and prices would peak at just $22/ton in 2050. Just how fundamentally different these markets would be is based on how inclusive the definition of \u2018high-quality' is. This makes the work of the Integrity Council on Voluntary Carbon Markets and registries like Verra very important.\n* A removal scenario would send offset prices to new highs, but the rise is gradual and gives buyers time to brace: An alternate outcome from the two scenarios above is a market that focuses entirely on carbon removals, which have inaccurately developed a reputation as always driving more impact than avoidance. This dichotomy is further obscured by groups like the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI), who will only allow members to achieve net-zero by using removal offsets such as reforestation, agriculture, DAC and BECCS. A removal-only market keeps the supply-demand balance skintight out to 2050, with the market briefly undersupplied from 2037 to 2044. Prices would rise to a manageable $42/ton in 2030, before shooting up to $105/ton in 2032 and $254/ton in 2037 - set by expensive forestry projects in Malaysia and valuing the market at $953 billion annually. Companies will have trouble stomaching such prices, but they come late enough that affordable alternatives may be available to still drive needed decarbonization. It's also possible that a removal-only market could alienate buyers and lead to the creation of a separate pure avoidance market. In this avoidance market, offsets like REDD+, clean energy and clean cookstoves would be cheaper early on, but prices eventually reach $32/ton in 2050, valuing the market at $100 billion.\n\nStory continues*BloombergNEF (BNEF), Bloomberg's primary research service, covers clean energy, advanced transport, digital industry, innovative materials and commodities.

it will grant hundreds of new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea in a bid for energy independence, ignoring calls from environmental campaigners and the United Nations to stop the development of new fossil fuel projects. The plans announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak include a pledge to invest 20 billion pounds ($26 billion) in carbon capture and storage projects as Sunak maintained the government\u2019s commitment to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050. Sunak, who is traveling to Scotland to formally unveil the package, said Britain will still need fossil fuels even after the country reaches its net zero target.\n\n12h ago\n* ![](https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eyxS74w08YMvX67uy1wKVw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yODg7dz01MTQ7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/33d731aec017e926b4c71e3c6178b608.cf.webp)Bloomberg#### [The Invisible Climate Impact of a Cruise Ship](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invisible-climate-impact-cruise-ship-131855048.html)\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Cruise operators are replacing oil-based fuel with liquefied natural gas to run their ships and pitching the shift as a greener way to travel.

By contrast, human activity typically increases carbon emissions to the atmosphere and diminishes species populations and diversity. Nowhere is this distinction more obvious than in the harvesting of wood from forests, but the carbon cost of this practice has been overlooked \u2014 until now.

set green goals would want its customers to know it? Not so fast. A new trend is emerging in the business world in which companies have zero emissions targets but decide not to make them public. It\u2019s called \u201cgreenhushing,\u201d and it\u2019s becoming common for companies to stay muted about their climate strategies, whether due to caution, restraint, anxiety, or defiance.\n\n\nGreenhushing has a little in common with greenwashing \u2014 it\u2019s actually its counterpart. Let\u2019s determine the nuances and figure out why environmental pressures are pulling and pushing companies in various directions and with curious results.\n\n\n[![](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2023/06/cleantechnica-support-subscribe-news.png)](https://cleantechnica.fundjournalism.org/contribute/)\n**What is greenwashing?** According to NRDC, [greenwashing](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/what-greenwashing) is the act of making false or misleading statements about the environmental benefits of a product or practice. It can be a way for companies to continue or expand their polluting as well as related harmful behaviors, all while gaming the system or profiting off well-intentioned, sustainably minded consumers.\n\n\nSection 5 of the FTC Act \u2014\u00a0[guides](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-260) set forth from the Federal Trade Commission that delineate its current views about environmental claims \u2014 prohibits deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce. A representation, omission, or practice is deceptive if it is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances and is material to consumers\u2019 decisions. Labeling that uses terms like \u201cnatural,\u201d \u201cgreen,\u201d \u201ceco-friendly,\u201d \u201cenvironmentally friendly,\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d may be more deceptive than actual.\n\n\nA plastic water bottle with labeling that boasts its natural source, for example, is doing more environmental harm than good \u2014 the bottled water industry\u2019s global success comes at a huge environmental, climate and social cost, according to a [report](https://inweh.unu.edu/global-bottled-water-industry-a-review-of-impacts-and-trends/) published by the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment, and Health.\n\n\n**How is greenwashing different than greenhushing?** In [greenwashing](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/01/13/regulators-feel-pressure-to-take-a-harder-stance-on-greenwashing/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGreenwashing%20is%20a%20type%20of,the%20Media%20Education%20Lab%2C%20told), businesses exaggerate their commitment to sustainability. Claims in these cases are hyperbolic in order to assuage an increasingly bio-conscious consumer base. When brought to public attention, greenwashing claims spur anger and even legal repercussions \u2014 consumers were led to believe that their favorite brands were making a significant effort to green their services and products, and they were led astray.\n\n\nGreenhushing, on the other hand, captures the tensions that have arisen due to the politicization of the environment. Companies that join in greenhushing do their best to hide their sustainability goals \u2014 they don\u2019t want to be categorized as greenwashers, which could suppress their customer base and cast a negative light on their profitability.\n\n\n**What is greenhushing?** Firms engage in greenhushing when they have active company net zero goals and policies. They recognize it is important to reduce their carbon footprint, so they\u2019re cutting energy use, regulating business travel, doing business with sustainable suppliers, taking advantage of carbon offsets, strategizing solutions to waste, conserving water, choosing sustainable materials over plastic, and seeking out other methods to build greater sustainability.\n\n\nHowever, many of these companies aren\u2019t transparent about their zero emissions efforts \u2014 they\u2019re staying quiet about climate goals and progress.\n\n\nA 2022 [report](https://inweh.unu.edu/global-bottled-water-industry-a-review-of-impacts-and-trends/) by South Pole, the climate consultancy and carbon offset developer, revealed that nearly a quarter of surveyed global climate leaders \u201cwill not be publicizing their achievements and milestones in the climate space beyond the bare minimum or as required.\u201d Often that decision is a direct result of the fractured political climate, in which to be seen as embracing climate mitigation goals may project the image of an outsider to a conservation base.\n\n\nSouth Pole notes that 1 in 4 of the 1,200 large private companies that have set climate targets do not intend to publicize them.\n\n\nOn one side you have progressives who are seeking legal recourse to require Big Business to do their part to alleviate rising global temperatures. On the other side you have conservative legislators who have struck out at companies that have stepped up to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) responsibilities with prohibitions and public shaming. Partly, it\u2019s the ESG goals that have spurred the greenhushing controversy \u2014 companies who announce such milestones need to actually produce them, and, if they don\u2019t, shareholders complain.\n\n\n\u201cGreenhushing gained traction in fall 2022 in response to the groundswell of scrutiny of companies\u2019 ESG commitments and disclosures,\u201d [states](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/21/business/what-is-greenhushing.html)\u00a0Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. Remember how Tesla, the all-electric car company, was removed from the S&P 500 ESG Index? At the same time, Exxon and Marathon Oil were added. Tesla\u2019s \u201clack of a low-carbon strategy\u201d as well as \u201ccodes of business conduct\u201d were [cited](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/05/21/in-a-parallel-universe-oil-companies-included-in-sp-500-esg-index-while-tesla-kicked-out-oh-wait/) as reasons for its ESG scrutiny.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a business to do?\n\n\n**What are some examples of greenhushing?** As the *Washington Post* [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/13/inside-greenhushing-why-companies-are-going-green-then-going-quiet/), Wall Street greenhushing is often a reaction to Republican state treasurers and attorneys general in several states who have blacklisted banks that factor climate risks and social concerns into their investment decisions.\n\n\nGreenhushing is part of a US political battle over the climate crisis. Several states, such as [Florida](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/07/21/has-your-states-governor-rejected-climate-funding-mine-has-im-pied/), are divesting billions of dollars from BlackRock because it has developed strong ESG portfolios. [BlackRock](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/07/25/bill-mckibben-blasts-blackrock-decision-to-add-saudi-aramco-ceo-to-its-board/) has removed several references on its website to the firm\u2019s [climate commitments.](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/09/05/blackrock-battles-texas-again-over-divestments/) BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a major proponent of factoring in climate change risks to investing strategies and corporate leadership, has been navigating difficult financial terrain as he finds himself a top target of conservative politicians. So he\u2019s modified the language he uses to describe green investments. \u201cI don\u2019t use the word ESG anymore because it\u2019s been entirely weaponized \u2026 by the far left and weaponized by the far right,\u201d Fink told attendees of the [Aspen Ideas Festival](https://www.aspenideas.org/). But he said BlackRock would continue to discuss climate and social issues with the companies in which it has stakes.\n\n\nHSBC also has been accused of greenhushing in recent months. According to *EuroNews*, the asset management firm [downgraded](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/01/29/what-is-greenhushing-how-to-spot-the-sophisticated-greenwashing-tactics-being-used-in-2023) a number of Article 9 funds \u2014 exclusively invested in sustainable assets \u2014 to an Article 8 category. The latter are funds that promote environmental or social factors but do not need to target a sustainable outcome.\n\n\nASOS [removed](https://www.netzeroinvestor.net/news-and-views/spotlight-why-corporates-fear-accusations-of-greenhushing) the \u201cResponsible Edit\u201d clothes filter section of its website without any public announcement.\n\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n\nGOP lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee have planned 6 hearings on what they call \u201cwoke investing.\u201d They claim progressives are using financial tools for the purpose of advancing their political goals. These \u201cfreedom loving\u201d Republicans face an uphill battle against ESG flows of money and their own voters\u2019 preferences.\n\n\nIf all companies were made to adhere to ESG [metrics](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/01/13/regulators-feel-pressure-to-take-a-harder-stance-on-greenwashing/) to quantify climate pollution impact, no company would be exempt from setting climate action goals. The [number of governments](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/05/10/the-effects-of-mandatory-esg-disclosure-around-the-world/) that have introduced legislation making ESG reporting mandatory reflects how ESG reporting is not a fleeting trend \u2013 it is here to stay to help businesses avoid risks of global stranded assets. The value of future lost profits in the upstream oil and gas sector are [projected](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01356-y) to exceed $1 trillion under plausible changes in expectations about the effects of climate policy.\n\n\nShareholders have every right to know what\u2019s ahead, and greenhushing is one more obstacle to a full and robust transition to global renewable energy usage.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*I don't like paywalls.

Investors looking to diversify their commodity exposure and portfolios should look to opportunities in California\u2019s carbon market . The KraneShares California Carbon Allowance ETF ([KCCA](https://etfdb.com/etf/KCCA/) ) offers exposure and is noteworthy, given strong performance this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKCCA offers targeted exposure to the joint California and Quebec carbon allowance markets. It stands to benefit from California\u2019s aggressive push to reduce emissions alongside the increasing demand for allowances within the market.\n\n\n\n\n![The fund is up 21.74% YTD](/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMjMvMDcvMzEvNTdrcnBvcWdycV9LQ0NBX2NoYXJ0XzEwLnBuZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNzUweFx1MDAzZSJdXQ/KCCA_chart-10.png)\n\n\nThe fund is up 21.74% YTD, soaring over 11% in July alone as California policy support remains strong. While the finalization of tightening measures is ongoing, more aggressive emissions reductions will benefit the state\u2019s cap-and-trade-market. Greater tightening also is likely to lead to demand and supply imbalance in the long-term, creating positive pricing pressure for allowances.\n\n\n***See also:*** [California\u2019s Carbon Market Forecast for Supply Deficit by 2030](https://www.etftrends.com/climate-insights-channel/californias-carbon-market-forecast-deficit-2030/)\n\n\nKCCA remains solidly in \u201cbuy\u201d territory. The fund remains significantly elevated above both its 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA. Funds above their SMAs are considered a buy for both investors and trend followers. It has been above both SMAs since March 21, 2023.\n\n\nThis market is one of the fastest-growing carbon allowance programs worldwide. Its benchmark is the IHS Markit Carbon CCA Index. The index includes up to 15% of the carbon credits from Quebec\u2019s market.\n\n\nKCCA\u2019s index measures a portfolio of futures contracts on carbon credits issued by the CCA. The index only includes futures with a maturity in December in the next year or two. The fund also uses a wholly owned subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, which makes a K-1 unnecessary for taxes.\n\n\nKCCA carries an expense ratio of 0.78%.\n\n\n*For more news, information, and analysis, visit the [Climate Insights Channel](https://etfdb.com/climate-insights-channel/).*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\nContent continues below advertisement\n\n\nVideo Player is loading.Play VideoPlayUnmuteCurrent Time\u00a00:00/Duration\u00a0-:-Loaded: 0%0:00Stream Type\u00a0LIVESeek to live, currently playing liveLIVERemaining Time\u00a0-0:00\u00a0Playback Rate1xChapters* Chapters\nDescriptions* descriptions off, selected\nCaptions* captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n* captions off, selected\nAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.\n\nThe media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.Beginning of dialog window.

component of carbon trading and carbon offset programs, designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and combat climate change. The basic concept revolves around assigning a monetary value to a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions reduced or removed from the atmosphere. One carbon credit is typically equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases.  \n  \nThe carbon credits market size was valued at $2 billion in 2022, and is estimated to reach $143.5 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 55.5% from 2023 to 2032.  \n\n\n\n  \nGet a PDF brochure for Industrial Insights and Business Intelligence: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/107610  \n  \nCarbon credits, also known as carbon offsets, are tradable units that represent a reduction or removal of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the atmosphere. They are used as a tool to mitigate climate change by enabling individuals, organizations, and governments to take responsibility for their emissions and support emission reduction projects.  \n  \nBuyers, such as companies, governments, or individuals, purchase carbon credits to offset their own emissions and meet their sustainability goals. The carbon credits are transferred from the seller to the buyer, often facilitated through specialized platforms or exchanges. Carbon credits help the companies to minimize their greenhouse gas emissions.  \n  \nThe key players profiled in the carbon credits market report include South Pole, 3Degrees, EKI Energy Services Ltd, TerraPass, NATUREOFFICE, Moss.Earth, Climate Impact Partners, Carbon Credit Capital, LLC, CarbonBetter, and NativeEnergy.  \n  \nCarbon credits are generated through projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions. These projects can include renewable energy installations, energy efficiency improvements, methane capture from landfills or agricultural operations, reforestation and afforestation initiatives, and other activities that lead to a decrease in GHG emissions.  \n  \nCarbon credits work on the principle of \"offsetting\" emissions. When an entity, such as a company or individual, emits carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, they can purchase carbon credits equivalent to the amount of emissions they have produced. The money from the purchase goes towards funding emission reduction projects. By buying and retiring these credits, the entity is effectively offsetting their own emissions by supporting projects that reduce emissions elsewhere.  \n  \nEmission reduction projects often deliver co-benefits beyond GHG reductions. For example, renewable energy projects contribute to the transition to clean energy sources, create jobs, and improve air quality. Reforestation initiatives enhance biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Sustainable development principles are often integrated into the design and implementation of emission reduction projects to ensure they promote social, economic, and environmental benefits.  \n  \nIn order to meet the net-zero carbon emissions, it is necessary to lower greenhouse gas emissions to almost 50% by 2030 and to reduce to net zero by 200. Thus, purchasing carbon credits can help in addressing huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions.  \n  \nCarbon credits are basically the certificates that represents the amount of greenhouse gases removed from the atmosphere.  \n  \nBuy This Report (280 Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures): https://bit.ly/44HOP3I  \n  \nHere's how the process generally works:  \n  \nEmission Reduction Projects: Organizations or individuals can undertake projects that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These projects can be in various forms, such as renewable energy installations, reforestation efforts, energy efficiency improvements, or methane capture from landfills.  \n  \nVerification and Certification: Independent third-party organizations assess these projects to verify their emission reduction claims. Once the projects meet certain criteria and standards, they are certified, and the amount of emission reduction achieved is quantified in carbon credits.  \n  \nCarbon Credit Trading: These certified carbon credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets. Buyers are typically companies or individuals looking to offset their own emissions to meet carbon reduction targets or voluntary commitments.  \n  \nCarbon Offset: The buyer, by purchasing carbon credits, effectively offsets a corresponding amount of their own carbon emissions. This means that the overall carbon emissions in the atmosphere remain the same because the reduction achieved through the emission reduction project balances out the buyer's emissions.  \n  \nEnvironmental Benefits: The projects funded by carbon credit purchases have a positive environmental impact by reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.  \n  \nIn addition, participating in voluntary carbon credit markets enables companies to showcase climate leadership and demonstrate their commitment to addressing climate change. This involvement often goes beyond basic compliance requirements, as companies voluntarily take additional measures to reduce their emissions and support emission reduction projects.  \n  \nSuch initiatives can drive innovation in clean technologies and sustainable practices. These factors are anticipated to drive the carbon credits market forecast in the upcoming years.  \n  \nAn increase in the number of public and private organizations that help in achieving environmental sustainability by trading carbon credits is anticipated to boost the market demand during the forecast period.  \n  \nThe carbon credits market share is segmented on the basis of type, system, end-use industry, and region. By type, it is classified into regulatory and voluntary. By system, it is classified into cap-and-trade and baseline-and-credit. By end-use industry, it is classified into aviation, energy, industrial, petrochemical, and others.  \n  \nImpact of COVID-19  \n  \nThe carbon credits sector is largely monitored by the governments across several countries. The carbon credits market opportunities were hampered during the pandemic due to reduced investments on emission reduction projects such as carbon sustainability projects and renewable energy projects.  \n  \nRead More Information: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/carbon-credits-market-A107126  \n  \nThe carbon credits market was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to economic crisis across several countries, travel restrictions, closure of manufacturing units, and reduced energy consumption.  \n  \nSimilar Reports:-  \n  \nAdvanced Energy Market by Application (Electricity generation, Electricity Delivery & Management, Building Efficiency, Water Efficienecy, Transportation, Fuel Production & Delivery): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2030  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/advanced-energy-market-A15774  \n  \nAI in Energy Market By Component type (Solutions, Services), By Application (Robotics, Renewables Management, Demand Forecasting, Safety and Security, Infrastructure, Others), By End user (Energy Transmission, Energy Generation, Energy Distribution, Utilities), By Deployment Type (On-premise, Cloud): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2021-2031  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/ai-in-energy-market-A12587  \n  \nSmart Energy Market by Product (Smart grid, Digital Oilfield, Smart Solar, and Home energy management system), End-User Industry (Residential, Industrial, and Commercial): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2027  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/smart-energy-market-A09434  \n  \nDavid Correa5933 NE Win Sivers Drive#205, Portland, OR 97220United StatesUSA/Canada (Toll Free):+1-800-792-5285, +1-503-894-6022UK: +44-845-528-1300Hong Kong: +852-301-84916India (Pune): +91-20-66346060Fax: +1(855)550-5975help@alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nWeb: www.alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nAllied Market Research Blog:   \n  \nhttps://blog.alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nAllied Market Research (AMR) is a full-service market research and business-consulting wing of Allied Analytics LLP based in Portland, Oregon.

in the north east of Scotland.\n\nCampaigners said that extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea would \"send a wrecking ball through the UK's climate commitments\". \n\nBut Mr Sunak said granting the new licences was \"entirely consistent\" with net zero commitments.\n\nIt comes as the party faces internal divisions over its green policies - such as the [review over low-traffic

Scotland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001p6l2) programme, then later visited the site.\n\nIt is one of four carbon capture projects which will share up to \u00a320bn of funding.\n\nMr Sunak said the announcement would support thousands of jobs across the UK. \n\nHe said granting the new oil and gas licences was \"the right thing to do\".\n\n![St Fergus Gas

gas terminal in AberdeenshireHe said: \"Even when we reach net zero in 2050, a quarter of our energy needs will still come from oil and gas and domestic gas production has about a quarter or a third of the carbon footprint of imported gas.\"\n\nThe prime minister also said it made \"absolutely no sense\" to import energy supplies with \"two to three times the carbon footprint of what we have got at home\".\n\nHe said increasing home-grown sources of energy would improve the UK's resilience, create jobs and generate tax revenue to fund public services.\n\nMr Sunak said the government was determined to transition to net zero in a \"proportionate and pragmatic\" way. \n\nAnd he also defended his plans to fly to Scotland as \"an efficient use of time for the person running the country\" and highlighted investment in new technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nThe prime minister said: \"If your approach to climate change is to say that no one should go on holiday, no one should go on a plane, I think you are completely and utterly wrong.\"\n\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/9C98/production/_106288004_941672d4-0b86-4ba2-9f56-8bac4285d8f6.jpg)![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/9C98/production/_106288004_941672d4-0b86-4ba2-9f56-8bac4285d8f6.jpg)![Analysis

quite controversially, on track one of funding for this back in 2021.\n\nInstead it went to two projects in the north of England.\n\nThat was highly controversial because there had been heavy hints placed that the Scottish project would form part of that.\n\nIt was one of the most advanced projects in the UK, if not the most advanced, and then suddenly it was dropped.\n\nThe accusation was that the Conservative government at Westminster was favouring Red Wall constituencies following its success at the last general election.\n\nBut it was always the case that this would be a sequencing of events.\n\nBetween the projects announced in 2021 and today 10 mega tonnes of carbon dioxide will be captured and stored by 2030, the UK government says.\n\nThat includes emissions from Mosmorran, from Grangemouth, from a new power station to be built at Peterhead and, potentially, from direct air capture.\n\nIt effectively sucks carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and also stores it.\n\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/9C98/production/_106288004_941672d4-0b86-4ba2-9f56-8bac4285d8f6.jpg)![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/9C98/production/_106288004_941672d4-0b86-4ba2-9f56-8bac4285d8f6.jpg)Labour's Ed Miliband claimed the Conservatives' energy policy had left Britain as \"the worst hit country in Western Europe during the energy crisis\".\n\nMr Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: \"Rishi Sunak's weak and confused policy will not take a penny off bills - as his own party chair has admitted - will do nothing for our energy security, and drive a coach and horses through our climate commitments, while continuing to leave us at the mercy of fossil fuel dictators like Putin.\"\n\nAnd Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf said the new oil and gas licences demonstrated the UK government was \"not serious about tackling the climate emergency\".\n\nHe [tweeted](https://twitter.com/HumzaYousaf/status/1685955898089381888?s=20): \"For the PM to announce unlimited extraction of oil & gas, in the week the UN has confirmed July is set to be the hottest month in human history, shows the PM is willing to recklessly gamble the future of our planet for cheap political gain.\"\n\n![Map showing oil and gas activity](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/EA2D/production/_130594995_north_sea_oil_gas_activity2-nc.png)![Map showing oil and gas

companies.\n\nIt would become Scotland's first carbon capture and storage facility, which would see harmful greenhouse gas emissions piped under the North Sea. \n\nThis would prevent the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, by capturing it at the point where the fossil fuel is being burnt. \n\nThe UK government said its \"decisive action\" would provide highly-skilled jobs for young people in the region.\n\nIt added this package would \"defend the public\" against the disruption of global energy supplies by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n'Wrecking ball'\n---------------\n\nHowever, climate campaigners criticised the decision to award new fossil fuel licences.\n\nOxfam climate change policy advisor Lyndsay Walsh said the announcement was another example of the government's \"hypocritical and dangerously inconsistent climate policy\".\n\nShe added: \"Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK's climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low carbon economy and our own abundant renewables.\"\n\nMike Childs, head of policy at environmental charity Friends of the Earth, said the government needed to focus on energy efficiency and home-grown renewable resources rather than \"championing more costly and dirty fossil fuels\".\n\nHe added: \"Climate change is already battering the planet with [unprecedented wildfires and heatwaves](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58073295) across the globe.\"\n\nAnd Fabrice Leveque, climate and energy policy manager at WWF Scotland, said politicians should be focusing on helping households to transition to clean heating rather than \"chasing the mirage of cheap domestic fossil fuels\".\n\nHe added: \"These new licences will do nothing to cut households' energy bills and ignore the best way to boost our energy security - reducing demand for fossil fuels in the first place by insulating homes and replacing oil and gas boilers and vehicles with clean alternatives that run on cheap, homegrown renewables.\"\n\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/9C98/production/_106288004_941672d4-0b86-4ba2-9f56-8bac4285d8f6.jpg)![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/9C98/production/_106288004_941672d4-0b86-4ba2-9f56-8bac4285d8f6.jpg)What

electricity emits carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the main driver of climate change.\n\nThe carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground.\n\nCarbon capture technology is seen by policy makers as a vital tool in reaching the net zero target by the middle of the century.\n\nSome environmentalists, however, are against it because they consider it a distraction from the urgent need to cut emissions.\n\n* [How does carbon capture fight climate change?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64723497)\nThe Acorn Project has been under development in various forms for more than a decade.\n\nIt had hoped to be one of the first projects of its kind to receive government backing in 2021, but lost out to two projects in the north of England around the Humber and the Mersey.\n\nSNP Westminster leader and MP for Aberdeen South, Stephen Flynn, said \"broken promises\" had left Scotland's green energy future in jeopardy.\n\nWelcoming the investment, he added: \"There can be no more broken promises or delays. Now is the time to strike on Scotland's green energy potential.\"\n\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/9C98/production/_106288004_941672d4-0b86-4ba2-9f56-8bac4285d8f6.jpg)![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/9C98/production/_106288004_941672d4-0b86-4ba2-9f56-8bac4285d8f6.jpg)There have been questions raised about the government's ability to meet its 2050 net zero target, with its climate advisers having [warned the UK risks falling behind without much faster action.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58874518)\n\nOn Friday, Mr Sunak said he was committed to meeting the target in a \"pragmatic and proportionate way\" but without \"unnecessarily adding costs and burdens to families\".\n\nNet zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nMr Sunak has faced calls from some Tories to change the deadline for the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesels cars, but told the Sunday Telegraph he was not planning to do so.\n\nThere has also been debate over the expansion of London's ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which was widely seen as helping Conservatives seal a narrow victory in the Uxbridge by-election.\n\nBoth Mr Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have urged London mayor Sadiq Khan to reflect on the rollout as people struggle with cost-of-living pressures.\n\nRelated Topics\n--------------\n\n* [Carbon capture and

We are focused on understanding the challenges and opportunities for businesses posed by climate change in terms of both physical and transition risk.\n\nCVC is committed to helping accelerate the energy transition and proactively managing the impacts of this on our portfolio. We believe that reducing our own GHG emissions footprint and engaging with the portfolio to do the same, is not only the right thing to do for society and the planet, but that it also creates long-term value for our companies and stakeholders.\n\n##### Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n\nCVC has publicly set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions targets with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This target was approved by the Board of CVC and has been validated by the SBTi.\n\n**Scope 1 and 2:** CVC commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 73% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.\n\n**Scope 3 Portfolio Targets:** CVC commits to 40% of its eligible private equity and listed equity investments by invested capital setting SBTi validated targets by 2027, and 100% of its eligible private equity and listed equity investments by invested capital setting SBTi validated targets by 2035.\n\n##### Operational emissions\n\nOur direct and indirect operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) are predominantly result of the running of our offices. We aim to reduce these emissions by:\n\n* Purchasing renewable energy\n* Electrifying our vehicle fleet\n* Considering energy efficiency in new leases\n\nBy purchasing renewable electricity, we have significantly reduced our scope 2 emissions and plan to do the same in future years.\n\n![Decorative image.](/)![CVC Chart Page 35](/)### Portfolio emissions\n\nEmissions from our investment portfolio (scope 3, category 15) account for the vast majority of our GHG emissions footprint. We are therefore prioritising the decarbonization of our portfolio, with a particular focus on our PE portfolio, where there is the largest exposure and we have the most influence. We have a structured engagement programme to support our portfolio companies to measure emissions, develop tangible action plans to reduce their emissions and set their own science-based targets.\n\n##### CVC Planet and People Grants (formerly EcoGrants)\n\nTo help CVC's portfolio companies accelerate progress on environmental and GHG reduction initiatives.\n\nFind out more about how CVC's EcoGrant scheme is helping portfolio company DKV to become climate positive in its own operations by 2023 and helping customers to reduce their carbon emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\nDKV Mobility \u2013 Using a CVC EcoGrant\n-----------------------------------\n\n  Play video.

By contrast, human activity typically increases carbon emissions to the atmosphere and diminishes species populations and diversity. Nowhere is this distinction more obvious than in the harvesting of wood from forests, but the carbon cost of this practice has been overlooked \u2014 until now. [Writing in *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06187-1), Peng *et al*.[2](#ref-CR2) report the true carbon cost of wood harvests, which have reduced more carbon storage in vegetation and soils than any other practice except agriculture[3](#ref-CR3),[4](#ref-CR4).\n\n\n\nAccess options\n--------------\n\n\n\n\n\n[Access through your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-02238-9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Access through your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-02238-9)\n\n\n[Change institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-02238-9)\n\n\n[Buy or subscribe](#access-options)\n\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n24,99\u00a0\u20ac /\u00a030\u00a0days\n\ncancel any time\n\n[Learn more](https://shop.nature.com/products/plus)Subscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 51 print issues and online access\n\n185,98\u00a0\u20ac per year\n\nonly 3,65 \u20ac per issue\n\n[Learn more](/nature/subscribe)Rent or buy this article\n\nPrices vary by article type\n\nfrom$1.95\n\nto$39.95\n\n[Learn more](//www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02238-9.epdf?no_publisher_access=1&r3_referer=nature)Prices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\n\n\n### Additional access options:\n\n\n* [Log in](https://idp.nature.com/authorize/natureuser?client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-02238-9)\n* [Learn about institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/license-options)\n* [Read our FAQs](https://support.nature.com/en/support/home)\n* [Contact customer support](https://www.springernature.com/gp/contact)\n\n\n\n\n*Nature* **620**, 44-45 (2023)\n\n\n*doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02238-9*\n\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1.

degree C rise in global temperatures is likely to cause compared with a 1.5 degree C rise, and that limiting Global Warming to 1.5 degree C may still be possible with ambitious action from national and sub-national authorities, civil society, and the private sector.\n\n\nThe rate of climate change is increasing and lack of rapid action to address it is causing alarm in the scientific community (*IPCC Progress Report to Parliament 28 June 2023, IPCC Sixth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis*).\u00a0\n\n\nNorfolk\u2019s councils are cutting carbon emissions in their areas, but not as fast as the science demands.\u00a0 BDC adopted an organisational 2030 target for achieving net- zero carbon emissions on 13 October 2022, but this does not address wider district carbon emissions.\n\n\nThe UK Parliament and approximately 300 Local Authorities (75%) have declared a climate emergency (LGA,2022)\n\n\nBiodiversity is essential both to humans, through the provision of ecosystem services such as food, fuel, flood prevention and enjoyment, and in its own right as part of the natural world.\u00a0\n\n\nBiodiversity is under severe threat.\u00a0 Nearly 500 species have become extinct in England in the last 200 years, 40% of the UK\u2019s reedbeds have disappeared since 1945, 75% of England\u2019s lowland heaths have been lost in the last 200 years, nearly 50% of England and Wales\u2019 ancient woodland has been destroyed and current rates of extinction may be 1,000 times greater than global natural background levels.\u00a0 (*Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership*).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Environment Act 2021 set out the importance of biodiversity net gain, an approach to development that aims to leave the natural environment in a better state than it was beforehand, together with a stronger legal duty for public bodies to conserve and enhance biodiversity.\u00a0\n\n\nActions to restore nature and biodiversity are vital for their own sake, and increase storage of carbon, helping to address climate change.\u00a0 Climate change and the loss of biodiversity will change the future for humanity and should be considered in conjunction with each other.\n\n\n**Motion** \n\n\n1) Council recognises the dangerous and accelerating effects of unmitigated climate change and ecological destruction for Broadland, Norfolk, and globally.\n\n\n2) Council resolves to declare a Climate and Biodiversity Emergency to highlight the importance and significance of climate change and biodiversity in all we do.\u00a0\n\n\n3) Council resolves to act accordingly within the limits of its resources and powers and report back regularly on progress.\u00a0\n\n\n"}, {"source": "Gulf Business", "title": "Reconciling human progress with

Veolia](https://gulfbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Pascal-Grante-Chief-Executive-Officer-Veolia-Near-and-Middle-East.jpg) Image: Veolia\n\nAs the ecological footprint of humanity becomes increasingly compromised due to the planetary trilemma of climate change, resource depletion and widespread pollution, it is time for all of us to collectively disrupt the incremental methods adopted to combat this ecological emergency and adopt a fresh approach instead.\n\n\nThe world today is in jeopardy largely because we have not acted in solidarity with a pragmatic view of the future, because we have not been able to balance sustainable human progress with economic growth and environmental protection.\n\n\nBut these do not need to be mutually exclusive dimensions of existence.\n\n\nJust as there is only one Earth for all of us and not separate ones for nature and humanity, in the same way there needs to be one collective and cohesive solution that can help forge a healthy planet for the prosperity of all.\n\n\nIn order to prevent a social paralysis due to environmental destruction and to ensure continuing human development, we therefore need urgent action that straddles economic, social, and environmental challenges all together as an inseparable whole. And the way to achieve that is by making decisive structural choices \u2013 by embracing an ecological transformation.\n\n\nWhether it\u2019s dealing with climate calamities, nurturing biodiversity, or decarbonising the economy, the current ecological emergency demands that we go beyond transition alone.\n\n\nWith environmental concerns so instantly visible, and their consequences for societies so immediate, the need of the hour is to accelerate and expand the deployment of existing solutions, while simultaneously working to create the results of tomorrow.\n\n\nFrom a dramatic race to lower greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of fragile ecosystems to the replacement of high-carbon infrastructure, investments in renewable energy and tackling plastic pollution, there are many pathways to secure an ecological transformation that averts a climate catastrophe and promotes inclusive development.\n\n\nThe UAE is focused on environmental protection\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWith the UAE declaring 2023 as the Year of Sustainability and excitedly preparing to host the 28th session of the [Conference of Parties](https://gulfbusiness.com/cop28-president-lays-down-climate-summits-agenda/) (COP28) in Dubai this November, this is a fantastic opportunity to rekindle the sense of urgency needed for an ecological transformation and preserve the planet and its rich biodiversity. By challenging climate change models of the last century, breaking down silos that separate economic, social, and environmental issues, and bridging the divides to critical breakthroughs, this is a moment in history to unite around decisive action to achieve both human progress and environmental protection.\n\n\nAnd this moment is imbued with renewed hope and optimism.\n\n\nA survey on ecological transformation led by [Veolia](https://www.veolia.com/en) in partnership with research and consulting firm Elabe has found that while 79 per cent of UAE residents share the certainty that climate disruptions are currently happening, 55 per cent feel that the future is in our hands and climate disruption and pollution can be controlled.\n\n\nThe Ecological Transformation Barometer also found that 70 per cent of respondents in the UAE feel that the cost of climate disruption and pollution would be more important in the future and override concerns about the investments needed to protect our environment, while 35 per cent think we need to change our ways of life and put in place technological solutions to lower climate risks. The survey also showed that 60 per cent of people are willing to accept 95 per cent of the changes that come with the green solutions provided they contribute to the country\u2019s food or energy security.\n\n\nWe must build on this optimism and determination to move forward together in the pursuit of ecological transformation.\n\n\nThe UAE is a shining example of this transformation by putting environmental protection at the heart of its development agenda for decades: it was the first country in the GCC to sign the Paris Agreement and launch its Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative. Inspired by that spirit, in the days, months and years that follow, let us pledge to unleash a paradigm shift for the benefit of future generations by reconciling human progress with environmental protection.\n\n\n**The writer is the CEO of Veolia Near & Middle East**\n\n\n"}], [{"source": "Bloomberg.com", "title": "Banks Propose Disclosing Just 33% of Capital Markets Emissions - Bloomberg",

The basic concept revolves around assigning a monetary value to a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions reduced or removed from the atmosphere. One carbon credit is typically equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases.  \n  \nThe carbon credits market size was valued at $2 billion in 2022, and is estimated to reach $143.5 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 55.5% from 2023 to 2032.  \n\n\n\n  \nGet a PDF brochure for Industrial Insights and Business Intelligence: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/107610  \n  \nCarbon credits, also known as carbon offsets, are tradable units that represent a reduction or removal of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the atmosphere. They are used as a tool to mitigate climate change by enabling individuals, organizations, and governments to take responsibility for their emissions and support emission reduction projects.  \n  \nBuyers, such as companies, governments, or individuals, purchase carbon credits to offset their own emissions and meet their sustainability goals. The carbon credits are transferred from the seller to the buyer, often facilitated through specialized platforms or exchanges. Carbon credits help the companies to minimize their greenhouse gas emissions.  \n  \nThe key players profiled in the carbon credits market report include South Pole, 3Degrees, EKI Energy Services Ltd, TerraPass, NATUREOFFICE, Moss.Earth, Climate Impact Partners, Carbon Credit Capital, LLC, CarbonBetter, and NativeEnergy.  \n  \nCarbon credits are generated through projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions. These projects can include renewable energy installations, energy efficiency improvements, methane capture from landfills or agricultural operations, reforestation and afforestation initiatives, and other activities that lead to a decrease in GHG emissions.  \n  \nCarbon credits work on the principle of \"offsetting\" emissions. When an entity, such as a company or individual, emits carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, they can purchase carbon credits equivalent to the amount of emissions they have produced. The money from the purchase goes towards funding emission reduction projects. By buying and retiring these credits, the entity is effectively offsetting their own emissions by supporting projects that reduce emissions elsewhere.  \n  \nEmission reduction projects often deliver co-benefits beyond GHG reductions. For example, renewable energy projects contribute to the transition to clean energy sources, create jobs, and improve air quality. Reforestation initiatives enhance biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Sustainable development principles are often integrated into the design and implementation of emission reduction projects to ensure they promote social, economic, and environmental benefits.  \n  \nIn order to meet the net-zero carbon emissions, it is necessary to lower greenhouse gas emissions to almost 50% by 2030 and to reduce to net zero by 200. Thus, purchasing carbon credits can help in addressing huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions.  \n  \nCarbon credits are basically the certificates that represents the amount of greenhouse gases removed from the atmosphere.  \n  \nBuy This Report (280 Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures): https://bit.ly/44HOP3I  \n  \nHere's how the process generally works:  \n  \nEmission Reduction Projects: Organizations or individuals can undertake projects that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These projects can be in various forms, such as renewable energy installations, reforestation efforts, energy efficiency improvements, or methane capture from landfills.  \n  \nVerification and Certification: Independent third-party organizations assess these projects to verify their emission reduction claims. Once the projects meet certain criteria and standards, they are certified, and the amount of emission reduction achieved is quantified in carbon credits.  \n  \nCarbon Credit Trading: These certified carbon credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets. Buyers are typically companies or individuals looking to offset their own emissions to meet carbon reduction targets or voluntary commitments.  \n  \nCarbon Offset: The buyer, by purchasing carbon credits, effectively offsets a corresponding amount of their own carbon emissions. This means that the overall carbon emissions in the atmosphere remain the same because the reduction achieved through the emission reduction project balances out the buyer's emissions.  \n  \nEnvironmental Benefits: The projects funded by carbon credit purchases have a positive environmental impact by reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.  \n  \nIn addition, participating in voluntary carbon credit markets enables companies to showcase climate leadership and demonstrate their commitment to addressing climate change. This involvement often goes beyond basic compliance requirements, as companies voluntarily take additional measures to reduce their emissions and support emission reduction projects.  \n  \nSuch initiatives can drive innovation in clean technologies and sustainable practices. These factors are anticipated to drive the carbon credits market forecast in the upcoming years.  \n  \nAn increase in the number of public and private organizations that help in achieving environmental sustainability by trading carbon credits is anticipated to boost the market demand during the forecast period.  \n  \nThe carbon credits market share is segmented on the basis of type, system, end-use industry, and region. By type, it is classified into regulatory and voluntary. By system, it is classified into cap-and-trade and baseline-and-credit. By end-use industry, it is classified into aviation, energy, industrial, petrochemical, and others.  \n  \nImpact of COVID-19  \n  \nThe carbon credits sector is largely monitored by the governments across several countries. The carbon credits market opportunities were hampered during the pandemic due to reduced investments on emission reduction projects such as carbon sustainability projects and renewable energy projects.  \n  \nRead More Information: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/carbon-credits-market-A107126  \n  \nThe carbon credits market was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to economic crisis across several countries, travel restrictions, closure of manufacturing units, and reduced energy consumption.  \n  \nSimilar Reports:-  \n  \nAdvanced Energy Market by Application (Electricity generation, Electricity Delivery & Management, Building Efficiency, Water Efficienecy, Transportation, Fuel Production & Delivery): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2030  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/advanced-energy-market-A15774  \n  \nAI in Energy Market By Component type (Solutions, Services), By Application (Robotics, Renewables Management, Demand Forecasting, Safety and Security, Infrastructure, Others), By End user (Energy Transmission, Energy Generation, Energy Distribution, Utilities), By Deployment Type (On-premise, Cloud): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2021-2031  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/ai-in-energy-market-A12587  \n  \nSmart Energy Market by Product (Smart grid, Digital Oilfield, Smart Solar, and Home energy management system), End-User Industry (Residential, Industrial, and Commercial): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2020-2027  \n  \nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/smart-energy-market-A09434  \n  \nDavid Correa5933 NE Win Sivers Drive#205, Portland, OR 97220United StatesUSA/Canada (Toll Free):+1-800-792-5285, +1-503-894-6022UK: +44-845-528-1300Hong Kong: +852-301-84916India (Pune): +91-20-66346060Fax: +1(855)550-5975help@alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nWeb: www.alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nAllied Market Research Blog:   \n  \nhttps://blog.alliedmarketresearch.com  \n  \nAllied Market Research (AMR) is a full-service market research and business-consulting wing of Allied Analytics LLP based in Portland, Oregon.

Many discussions about becoming carbon neutral have been lately geared toward carbon credits and markets. Some calling it a potential gold rush for agriculture. However, the carbon market can be very confusing to understand.\n\n\n\n### **What is a carbon credit?**\n\n\nA carbon credit allows the credit\u2019s owner to emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. One credit allows for the emission of one ton of greenhouse gasses.\n\n\n\n### **How does one receive a carbon credit?**\n\n\nThe main ways to receive carbon credits are to capture or reduce carbon emissions. Examples of ways farmers are receiving carbon credits are by planting trees, removing land from production, and perhaps the talked about in the dairy industry is adopting methane digesters. Adopted practices need to be the right fit for each dairy farm. Methane digester may not be the right fit for smaller farmers because of the higher start-up cost and low energy produced. However, improving soil health and adopting different manure application techniques may be a good fit for smaller farms.\n\n\n\n### **What is the market for carbon?**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, two different markets exist. While both use commodity pricing for credits, they are structured differently. The first is the voluntary carbon market. The voluntary market is a global market in which companies or organizations can purchase carbon credits to meet environmental goals set by their industries or partners.\n\n\n\nThe other market is the compliance carbon market. The compliance carbon market is policy-driven. Companies may purchase credits to meet regional, state, national, or international emission requirements. For example, an organization that produces carbon below its threshold can sell its additional credits to a company that produces above its enforced emissions requirement. The compliance market would operate somewhat similar to a milk quota system.\n\n\n\n### **What to consider before entering a carbon market?**\n\n\nThe first thing that needs to be considered is reducing carbon emissions or capturing carbon as the best fit for the farm. Some practices can be costly, so we need to know how these practices will pay off in the long run. We also need to explore the different markets. Contracts, acreage limits, payments, and carbon emission verifications differ between the markets. These types of questions should all be answered before entering a market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": "InvestorsObserver", "title": "Puro.earth and Xpansiv Partner to Expand Distribution Capacity for the Carbon Removals Market", "link": "https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/qm-pr/6854051629246753", "summary": "- Puro.earth CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) will be listed for trading on Xpansiv's CBL Spot Exchange.\n- The partnership will scale the carbon removals market and enhance price discovery and liquidity formation.\n- Puro.earth has 116 suppliers of negative emissions and 600 companies preparing to get certified.\n- CORCs can be traded alongside other environmental commodities on the exchange.\n- Puro.earth is the world's leading carbon crediting platform for engineered carbon removal.\n- Xpansiv operates the largest spot exchange for environmental commodities and provides registry infrastructure for energy and environmental markets.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryS1", "reason": "The article discusses Puro.earth CO2 Removal Certificates being listed for trading on Xpansiv's CBL Spot Exchange, indicating a system for removing carbon from the atmosphere."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses the listing of CO2 Removal Certificates for trading, indicating a positive step towards carbon removal from the atmosphere."}, "content": "\n\n\n*Certificates from* \n*l* \n*eading* \n*engineered carbon removal* \n*p* \n*latform* \n*to* \n*be made available* \n*on* \n*Xpansiv* \n*\u2019s* \n*CBL* \n*Spot Exchange* \n\n\n\n\n**HELSINKI,** \n**NEW YORK,** \n**LONDON, SYDNEY** \n**\u2014** \n[Puro](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yMCx1TF9RsO6VJL9r2jgnZhKhEsshVE9prjHWbfEOh9jMM6XHM8i9aS5LnZtJmNua6gypvlU0Qo1X9MDUhbg2w==) \n[.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LrERI5nsGOkuGM5yzsja1EVmRsNo88m5Esuk12Loy3dajdP-XCyQZmHPKOr_mZot) \n[e](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cMeiioI_OyS59C_yh-5wCAecyMrDVisfAphMy7R6jPezsD9oC8yh8iR0syp2r2Mf) \n[arth](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=C912fNyX9WWRtf7no8fBkfyRRWL0BIQPamebUDdlLykPk4ZC9OA9JuHXeKWqfBLazpYHK-BM8knCqiNKwZEuQQ==) \n , the world\u2019s first and leading carbon crediting platform for engineered carbon removal, and\n [Xpansiv](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TCyEWmJCkiRtdMQQVshk2L9-4Tos-ggpceIEK_UQDRFrX1YkC_EcqKLXfpzY22jnr2jMtGtGCNWrxjMKuDbZPg==) \n , the principal market infrastructure provider for the global energy transition, today announced that Puro.earth CO\n 2 \n Removal Certificates (CORCs) will be listed for trading on Xpansiv spot marketplace CBL, the largest spot exchange for trading voluntary carbon credits, renewable energy certificates (REC), and other environmental commodities.\n \n\n\n\n Bringing these two platforms together is a significant development in scaling the carbon removals market.

Its mission is to mobilize the economy to reward carbon net-negative emissions by helping voluntary corporate buyers accelerate carbon dioxide removal at an industrial global scale.\n \n\n\n* Puro Standard creates carbon credit methodologies for processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for at least 100 years. It then certifies suppliers that run those processes and issues digital, tradable CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) into the public Puro Registry per metric ton of carbon dioxide removed. CORCs are purchased directly from suppliers or via sales channel partners by ambitious corporations like Microsoft, Shopify, and Zurich Insurance, to help reverse climate change and neutralize residual carbon emissions.\n* Puro Accelerate is a program to scale the carbon removal ecosystem, assisting suppliers who require financing to launch or expand operations through CORC advance market commitments and prepayments.\n\n\n\n Website:\n [puro.earth](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mdPtq6pb24sG1NVnlKro6gNXWH7Jk6yrtWtWsw-7zWtn5zscA2iqmt3IsVqbsEmQvLdDyzykYU6U6W-09JXzuw==) \n ; LinkedIn\n [Puro.earth](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yMCx1TF9RsO6VJL9r2jgnT5AqNbJwFBR7dZViA3BFvn03WndphzG72y9mtvWLQ3sVWbMmhkCQqXLqTsEeZUgWhqaDzCQDvmmDuedIQ4cb7UOdIFPTa6QQtgCdD4aFfiu) \n ; Twitter\n [@PuroCO2Removal](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Ls7LpYVqm7lKN-iajXuBd9agD_arpfevUKn9C6aTa4rWG_APN97OOblyttZQHpPsS0RNC16Un783cXwAFnxwpd59diQ4CRX4RelPuofPL3s=) \n\n\n\n\n For Puro.earth media enquiries, please email:\n [puro@gongcommunications.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mdPtq6pb24sG1NVnlKro6uJiMCXLN7KOW4UKtcRe7w-mgnxkYq7N1O8s7KAeXphCqQ1-NUDVJKVWSU16odC8Qkv2VNTW2hUlkJqotqXFPPUImgNsgZ0WDZFxzj3TLsQI) \n\n\n\n\n**About Xpansiv** \n\n\n\n\n Xpansiv operates the market infrastructure to rapidly scale the world\u2019s energy transition.

The data will allow them to instantly locate the most carbon-efficient alternative.\n\n\n\n\n![Emissions](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n\n\n![Emissions](https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Untitled-design-32-1.jpg)\n\nRepresentation Image\nFrom January 2024, shipping will be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). As part of this, shipping owners, charterers, and traders will need to mitigate potential additional shipping costs by seeking more carbon-efficient fleets. According to analysis from LSEG and Siglar Carbon, choosing carbon-efficient ships and route planning could reduce potential carbon emission costs for traders and charterers by as much as 50%.\n\n\nFabrice Maille, Head of Shipping & Agriculture at LSEG, comments:\n\n\n\n> \u201cWhen trading physical commodities, it is vital to have the right data and insights when evaluating the different options for cargo programmes to cut emissions. For traders and charterers, this could halve carbon emissions costs.  \n> \n> \u201cThere are already ongoing efforts to decarbonise focusing on aspects such fuels but given how quickly the ETS will come into force, planning carbon-efficient voyages is low-hanging fruit logistically.\u201d\n> \n> \n\n\nSigmund Kyvik, Siglar Carbon CEO, comments:\n\n\n\n> \u201cOur carbon solutions already play a pivotal role in driving decarbonisation in the shipping industry. Through LSEG, we can capitalise on its unique position and scale of its Workspace platform to bring our insights to a wider audience.\u201d\n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to the Siglar Carbon index, a ship carrying gasoline between Europe and the USA via the TC2 route \u2013 one of the most commonly traded tanker routes \u2013 would emit approx. 1,800 tonnes of CO2 on the round voyage. The most efficient alternative would emit approx. 1,200 tonnes, and the related EU ETS cost would be approx. 25,000 USD.\n\n\nThe least efficient choice would emit 2,500 tonnes with a EU ETS cost of 50 000 USD. In 2026, once the EU ETS is fully phased in the same cost would add up to approx. 63,000 and 125,000 USD, respectively.\n\n\nFor ship owners, Siglar analysis shows that a charterer or owner who is active in the European short-sea market with 20 ships could generate approximately 100,000 tonnes of CO2-eligible emissions a year. At a carbon cost of USD 100 per EUA, this would mean an added cost of USD 10 million per year once the EU ETS is fully phased-in. Charterers and owners engaged in larger vessels could easily generate ETS eligible emissions close to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year with an annual carbon cost of 50 million USD.\n\n\n*Press
