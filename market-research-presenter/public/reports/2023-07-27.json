Carbon dioxide removal, as it\u2019s called, can sound like science fiction \u2014 but many companies are already counting on it to undo some of the damage caused by their pollution.\n\nCompanies might try to prevent their greenhouse gas emissions altogether, *or* they might try to clean it up after the fact. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing all kinds of brands, from [Microsoft](/2023/3/22/23651587/microsoft-climate-tech-startup-carboncapture-wyoming) to [the Houston Texans](/2023/1/9/23546460/houston-texans-nfl-offset-emissions-carbon-removal-climate-oil-occidental), saying that they\u2019ll plant trees or invest in new technologies that are supposed to filter CO2 out of the air. But even if they\u2019re successful in trapping CO2, does it reverse the consequences of creating that pollution in the first place?\n\nNot completely \u2014 at least not on a reasonable timeline, suggests a [study](http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg1801) published today in the journal *Science Advances*. It looks at the consequences carbon dioxide emissions have on an atmospheric circulation pattern called the [Hadley cell](https://www.climatesignals.org/climate-signals/hadley-cell-expansion) that has a big impact on weather across much of the world. The study shows what might happen to the world if people keep polluting willy-nilly before finding a way to take those CO2 emissions out of the atmosphere. \n\n\u201cNature is not that simple.\u201d \n\nSurprise, surprise \u2014 things don\u2019t just snap back to normal, the study finds. That shows how important it is to limit pollution now rather than waiting to clean it up later. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think that if we reduce the CO2 concentration, the atmosphere will recover to its original state,\u201d says Seo-Yeon Kim, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Seoul National University. \u201cNature is not that simple.\u201d \n\nThe Hadley cell is a defining factor for many of the world\u2019s deserts and rainforests. It moves moisture and heat between the tropics (regions closest to the equator) to the subtropics (adjacent areas further from the equator). Warm air rises in the tropics, bringing on lots of rain. The air then moves poleward to the subtropics, around 20 to 30 degrees north and south of the equator, before it comes back down as very dry air \u2014 which is why most of Earth\u2019s hot deserts lie in these subtropical regions. \n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are messing up that system. The Hadley cell is expanding, intensifying droughts in subtropical regions. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have more regions that will have become more desert-like,\u201d says Rei Chemke, an assistant professor at Weizmann Institute of Science focused on atmospheric, oceanic, and climate dynamics. \u201cEven modest changes could have large climate impact there on people.\u201d\n\nDroughts in expanding dry zones could exacerbate food and water shortages and displace people from their homes, the new paper notes. The Hadley cell has already intensified severe droughts in Chile and South Africa and affected agriculture in Southern Australia, says Richard Seager, a climate scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory.\n\nKim and her colleagues modeled what would happen if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise by 1 percent every year for the next 140 years \u2014 similar to a \u201c[high-emissions](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario/)\u201d scenario that\u2019s often described as \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d within climate research. Then, after that concentration had quadrupled, they modeled what would happen if the amount of C02 in the atmosphere dropped at the same rate over the same time period. In theory, that should cause the Hadley cell to contract \u2014 bringing its borders away from the poles back to where they were before carbon dioxide pollution shifted its boundaries.\n\nBut that\u2019s where things get a little wacky. The impact of taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere was different in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere of the planet. In the study, the northern edge of the Hadley cell moved even further south from where it used to be historically, overshooting the desired target. But the southern edge of the Hadley cell shifted much more slowly \u2014 so slow that it didn\u2019t return to its starting point. Given a couple more centuries, things could eventually shift back to normal. But in the meantime, that can make life particularly hard for people and wildlife dealing with the consequences.\n\nThings get a little wacky\n\nBoth Seager and Chemke, who were not involved in the study, say more work is needed to understand what might happen in a more realistic scenario than the one laid out in this study. Waiting 140 years before reducing carbon dioxide emissions leaves the world in a perilous place, with [weather disasters already](/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc) [becoming more frequent and extreme](/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change). It might be more helpful to policymakers to see what might happen to the Hadley cell on a shorter timeline with action taken more immediately. \n\nThere are a lot of variables to keep in mind that can lead to unexpected outcomes with efforts to take CO2 out of the atmosphere. The differences between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres\u2019 responses in the study were linked to ocean temperatures being more slow to respond to changes in CO2 concentrations, for instance. And [ozone depletion](/2023/1/10/23547383/ozone-layer-hole-healing-world-meteorological-organization) in the Southern Hemisphere also makes the Hadley cell\u2019s influence over shifting desert regions more pronounced there. \n\n### Related\n\n* [Visualizing the scale of the carbon removal problem](/2022/4/7/23013822/carbon-dioxide-removal-direct-air-capture-climate-change)\n* [Saving the forests won\u2019t be enough to stop climate change \u2014 we need substantial emission cuts](/2023/5/18/23727638/forest-carbon-capture-climate-change-study)\n\u201cThere will be surprises in what happens [when we draw CO2 down],\u201d Seager says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be equal and opposite to what happened when we started warming up the planet.\u201d\n\nTo avoid the worst effects of climate change, any efforts to take CO2 out of the atmosphere are really only supplementary at best. A transition to clean energy is what can stop planet-heating pollution from building up in the first place. \u201cReducing emissions right now is the most important thing,\u201d Kim says.\n\n"}, {"source": "Phys.org", "title": "Carbon capture may not rescue drought-prone regions, research finds", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-07-carbon-capture-drought-prone-regions.html", "summary": "- Invalid request sent by the browser\n- 400 bad request error occurred", "classification": {"category": "CategoryO1", "reason": "The article contains an HTTP error message, indicating that it is not related to carbon."}, "sentiment": {"score": 1, "reason": "The article does not contain any sentiment or information related to carbon removal or emission prevention."}, "content": "400 Bad request\n===============\n\n\nYour browser sent an invalid request.\n"}], [{"source": "Reuters", "title": "Global standards launched to boost $2 bln voluntary carbon market", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/global-standards-launched-boost-2-bln-voluntary-carbon-market-2023-07-26/", "summary": "- A global initiative aims to grow the $2 billion market for carbon offsets\n- Criteria for new voluntary standards for carbon offsets have been outlined\n- Labelled credits are hoped to be issued by the end of the year to bring transparency to the unregulated market\n- Demand for carbon offsets is expected to grow as companies with net-zero goals buy them to cancel out emissions elsewhere\n- The market is unregulated and lacks transparency, making it difficult to assess which credits to use\n- The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) has published criteria for projects to achieve its new Core Carbon Principle (CCP) standards\n- CCP credits will require additional measures, and not all existing credits will gain CCP status\n- Technology involving carbon capture and store in oil recovery projects and coal-fired power generation will be excluded from CCPs\n- Projects developing new gas plants might be included if they meet all requirements and lead to emissions reductions\n- Retired CCP credits will need to identify the company on whose behalf they were retired", "classification": {"category": "CategoryD1", "reason": "The article mentions companies with net-zero goals buying carbon offsets to cancel out emissions."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses a global initiative to grow the market for carbon offsets, which is seen as a positive step towards reducing emissions and mitigating climate change."}, "content": "LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - A global initiative designed to grow the $2 billion market for carbon offsets outlined criteria for new voluntary standards on Thursday, and hopes to issued labelled credits by the end of the year to bring transparency to the unregulated marketplace.\n\nDemand for carbon offsets - credits for emissions-reducing activity that can be generated through projects such as tree planting - is expected to grow as companies with net-zero goals buy them to cancel out emissions elsewhere.\n\nBut the market is unregulated, with many different standards and approaches making it difficult for companies to assess which credits they should use.\n\nCritics of the market cite concerns including poor transparency and questions over the environmental quality of projects.\n\nThe Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), an independent governance body for the market, has published its criteria for projects to achieve its new Core Carbon Principle (CCP) standards.\n\nThe criteria \"set a global threshold for quality which aims to unlock finance at speed and scale for projects to reduce and remove billions of tonnes of emissions that would not otherwise be viable,\" said Integrity Council Chair Annette Nazareth in a statement.\n\nThe most widely traded offsets standards are those deemed eligible under the CORISA scheme set up for the global airline industry.\n\nCCP approval will require many of the same features as CORISA, such as a project having quantified monitoring, reporting and verification standards, or being unable to go ahead without the revenue from the sale of carbon credits.\n\nHowever, CCP credits will require additional measures for some areas, such as further governance checks.

Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, characterized attempts to limit carbon emissions as useless.\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the law Democrats [passed last year](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-passes-major-health-tax-and-climate-bill-boost-democrats) that includes hundreds of billions for renewable energy tax credits and other climate priorities \u2014 could cost the federal government $1.2 trillion, according to some estimates, Johnson said.\n\n\n\u201cI have no idea where that money\u2019s going to be spent,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be spent trying to mitigate climate change, I would argue it\u2019s probably going to be misspent because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we can really do to hold back the tides.\u201d\n\n\nThe government should instead spend a fraction of that money to make sure the electric grid is reliable and resilient, even in the face of natural disasters, Johnson said.\n\n\n#### \u2018Both fronts\u2019\n\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Edwards told senators he has prioritized both limiting emissions and preparing infrastructure for extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, that are linked to climate change.\n\n\nAsked by Johnson if it wouldn\u2019t be more effective to focus on infrastructure resilience rather than limiting carbon emissions, Edwards said he had a difference of opinion with Johnson.\n\n\n\u201cI think we need to be acting on both fronts,\u201d he said.\n\n\nJohnson implied that a U.S. transition away from fossil fuels would not affect the carbon emissions of rapidly developing countries like China and India. Limiting fossil fuel production ignores the current economic reality, he said.\n\n\nBut Edwards said looking to renewable energy sources would be a wise long-term strategy.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an enemy of fossil fuels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been a fossil fuel state for over 100 years. But it\u2019s clear to me if we\u2019re going to be an energy state in the next 50 years, we\u2019re going to embrace the transition. We will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, increase our reliance on clean energy such as wind.\u201d\n\n\n#### Hopes remain for permitting overhaul\n\n\nThe [debt limit deal](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default) that Congress [passed this year](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-biden-debt-limit-legislation-ahead-monday-default-deadline) included some changes to how federal agencies grant environmental approvals for infrastructure and energy projects.\n\n\nBut those changes were insufficient to speed up projects that are hampered by administrative delays and legal challenges, according to Alex Herrgott, the leader of The Permitting Institute, a group that advocates for easier permitting requirements.\n\n\nTo see real change, lawmakers would have to alter bedrock environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, and the Clean Water Act, he said.\n\n\n\u201cIn practice, developers will still experience most of the same obstacles and avoidable process delays that have plagued the system for decades,\u201d Herrgott told the panel. \u201cTruly impactful legislation will have to move beyond macro-level NEPA changes and untangle the web of confusion and uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\nHerrgott, who led the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council under former President Donald Trump, said the issue was nonpartisan.\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a Republican or a Democrat issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a process issue we can fix.\u201d\n\n\nWhitehouse said he had \u201cnot given up hope on bipartisan permitting reform\u201d passing Congress this year.\n\n\nSeveral Democrats on the panel, including Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, said renewable energy projects and their associated transmission lines, as well as resilient infrastructure projects, were stymied by a lengthy permitting process.\n\n\n\u201cI think many Democrats want to do permitting reform,\u201d Kaine said.\n\n\nRepublicans on the panel also said they supported a permitting overhaul as part of a climate change agenda.\n\n\n\u201cJust like fossil fuel projects, renewable projects, face years of permitting delays,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t permitting reform be at the top list of anyone concerned about climate change?\u201d\n\n\n"}, {"source": "Scientific American", "title": "Forests Are Losing Their Ability to Hold Carbon", "link": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/forests-are-losing-their-ability-to-hold-carbon/", "summary": "The article is about an error message that appears as \"Error 403 Forbidden\" and \"Error 54113\" on a webpage.

Five years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have anticipated that.\u201d\n\n\nMoyer explained the mission of the CAPC and its successor created by Town Meeting \u2014 the Climate Action Commission \u2014 gave a brief history of Hingham climate action successes, and also shared what the plan does and doesn\u2019t do and its structure, including a carbon inventory.\n\n\nThe CAPC\u2019s charge was to evaluate a wide range of carbon emission reduction strategies and to propose measures to achieve a zero sum of carbon emissions produced and taken out of the atmosphere (i.e., \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions) by the year 2040 or another target date deemed feasible.\n\n\nThe CAC\u2019s role is to support, oversee, and report on the progress of the implementation of the town\u2019s Climate Action Plan.  \n\nThese efforts include:\n\n\n* investigating the feasibility of new technologies and best practices as applied to  \n\nHingham and to update the Climate Action Plan accordingly;\n* providing support to town committees and other municipal government entities as they work to act on recommendations to reduce carbon emissions;\n* working with businesses, residents, and organizations in town to help educate, support, and encourage adoption of low-carbon and no-carbon technologies; and\n* regularly disseminating information on the town\u2019s progress toward Net Zero carbon emissions.\n\n\nA survey to which there were 362 responses helped identify concerns and opportunities that the plan seeks to address. The CAPC also held 40 public meetings, three public engagement sessions, three Select Board presentations, and three presentations to other town entities along with making two presentations to community groups, holding two public events, and having three articles published.\n\n\nMoyer also explained what the plan does and doesn\u2019t do. \u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t obligate anyone to anything, mandate budget expenditures, or supplant normal town and approval processes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to action, and what it does do is make recommendations and ask residents, businesses and non-profits, and town government to consider actions to reduce carbon emissions.\u201d\n\n\nThe plan also recognizes economics and changes in technology and mandates continued refinement and growth. \u201cIt\u2019s a living document, and we need to mind it and watch it,\u201d Moyer said.\n\n\nThe plan is \u201cdeep, but accessible \u2014 it\u2019s digestible,\u201d he explained. He went on to explain how to review it and how to access the detailed recommendations, the body of the plan, and the carbon inventory containing a detailed analysis and list of assumptions as to how to calculate carbon emissions in the town, using the most recent data available from 2021.\n\n\nThe contours of the plan include electricity supply, buildings, transportation, waste, community outreach, air quality, and \u201cpublic pathways,\u201d natural resources including land conservation and management, and implementation.\n\n\nThe document also provides examples of potential grants and funding opportunities.\n\n\n\u201cI look forward to implementation of the plan and learning more about grant opportunities,\u201d Select Board Chair Liz Klein said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to digest.\u201d\n\n\nSelect Board member Joseph Fisher said he\u2019s impressed with the passion of the group of residents who comprise the committee and commission.\n\n\n**Climate change concerns brought up**  \n\nFellow board member William Ramsey asked about steps that could be taken to protect the town\u2019s infrastructure from the impacts of sea level rise and other climate change threats.\n\n\n\u201cHow are we going to protect our roadways and the downtown corridor, which are very much in jeopardy \u2014 including residences, businesses, and the sewer system?\u201d he asked.\n\n\nWhile how to reduce carbon emissions was the CAPC\u2019s main charge, Moyer agreed this is an important issue.\n\n\nCAPC member Henry Hidell agreed that protecting the infrastructure \u201cis a big deal\u201d and urged the formation of a long-range committee as soon as possible to begin addressing immediate needs and to identify short- and long-term issues. \u201cWe need to begin this process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\n\nPlanning Board member Gary Tondorf-Dick praised Moyer for his leadership \u201cof this talented group that studied this complex issue.\u201d\n\n\nKlein said she\u2019s confident the plan will be implemented and that \u201cit will not sit on a shelf.\u201d\n\n\n"}], [{"source": "Yahoo Finance", "title": "BUILDINGLINK ANNOUNCES SCIENCE-BASED TARGET COMMITMENT FOR CARBON REDUCTION", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buildinglink-announces-science-based-target-171100028.html", "summary": "- BuildingLink has received approval for its science-based target to reduce emissions\n- The company aims to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline year\n- BuildingLink will also measure and reduce Scope 3 emissions\n- The Science-Based Targets initiative promotes emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science\n- BuildingLink's carbon reduction initiatives include purchasing renewable energy certificates and collaborating with suppliers\n- The company will prioritize transparency and accountability in monitoring progress towards its target", "classification": {"category": "CategoryD1", "reason": "The article mentions BuildingLink committing to reducing emissions and setting science-based targets for carbon reduction."}, "sentiment": {"score": 5, "reason": "The article showcases BuildingLink's commitment to reducing emissions and taking climate action, which is considered a positive sentiment."}, "content": "NEW YORK, July 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- BuildingLink is proud to announce our company has received validation and approval on its science-based target in alignment with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reduce overall emissions as part of an ongoing pledge to climate action.

While all that melting is putting Arctic species at risk and increasing the possibility of pollution and environmental disasters as shipping lanes once blocked by ice open up, it is also putting human lives at risk, researchers said.\n\nGoogle has granted $5 million to the Woodwell Climate Research Center to support the development of an open-access resource that will allow residents in the Arctic to track permafrost thaw in real-time. The tracking tool will combine satellite technology with AI to provide potentially life-saving information to residents whose homes could be on the brink of collapsing with the land beneath it, Anna Liljedahl, an associate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told ABC News.\n\nWhile traditional remote sensing methods applied to satellite imagery would fall short, AI technology similar to facial recognition is being used to map out ice-wedge polygons beneath the ground -- \"ambiguous\" features that satellites would not be able to pick up \u2013 in similar ways to how it can detect degrading glaciers, Liljedahl said.\n\n\"With permafrost, we have to look at indirect signals because it's hidden in the ground,\" she said.\n\n![PHOTO: This picture taken on May 6, 2022 shows an anti-avalanche wall that was built to protect the houses in Longyearbyen, northern Norway.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/permafrost-town-sweden-file-gty-jef-230723_1690144206430_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg)This picture taken on May 6, 2022 shows an anti-avalanche wall that was built to protect the houses in Longyearbyen, northern Norway.Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty ImagesResearchers have found that the melting is so intense in some spots, it has essentially created a \"permafrost soup,\" in which there is a lot of water beneath where ice once stood, increasing the risk that the topography will cave in, she said.\n\n\"It's already causing big trouble for people living in the Arctic and their houses and roads and industry as well,\" Liljedahl said.\n\nMelting permafrost has been so severe in [Point Lay in northwest Alaska](https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2022/9/highlight/2) that water lines built into the ground shifted and broke, causing the hospital to go without water for a week in 2021, Liljedahl said.\n\nThe tool will allow communities living on Arctic permafrost to plan adequately for residents' safety and enable policymakers to make better decisions on the kinds of goals that countries should implement to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, Liljedahl said. The permafrost discovery gateway is using so many large datasets that it would crash a regular computer, Liljedahl said.\n\n\"We are creating here this easy-to-use tool so they can look at their community and look at their surroundings and have access to information to say, 'This would be a good location to perhaps move to,'\" Liljedahl said.\n\nIn addition, the emissions currently being tracked by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do not account for the emissions that are released due to falling Arctic permafrost, making the tracking of the melting even more critical, Liljedahl said.\n\n[MORE: Biden White House, tech companies launch new safeguards around emerging AI technology\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-white-house-tech-companies-launch-new-safeguards/story?id=101555314)### Ensure the world's food supply\n\nThe agricultural industry is one of the most labor-intensive -- and most important -- systems in the world. As global temperatures continue to rise, the world's food supply is expected to be jeopardized by an increase in severe weather events such as extreme flooding, prolonged drought and heat waves and even an [increase in plant pathogens](https://abcnews.go.com/US/climate-change-plant-pathogens-infect-crops-higher-rates/story?id=79267388) that could create widespread destruction of crops, experts say.\n\n\"If you're thinking about an industry that is most impacted by climate change, agriculture is probably the leading place,\" Jack Cornell, director of sustainable supply for the United Soybean Board, governing body for the U.S. commodity checkoff program for soybeans, said.\n\nAI will help to combat those stressors and make growing food more efficient while reducing its carbon footprint, Cornell told ABC News.\n\nOne of the biggest ways AI will help to reduce the harmful impacts of farming for the masses is determining when and where to place fertilizer, Cornell said.\n\nFarmers who previously drove a tractor for four hours, laying down fertilizer as they go, will now be able to utilize auto-steer technology that leads them to the exact spot that needs the fertilizer instead, which will prevent underusing or overusing the substance.\n\nVariable rate technology, a process in which AI will estimate how much to increase or reduce fertilizer based on computer modeling of soil and yield maps, will also allow farmers to determine how much to reduce or increase fertilizer based on the health of the soil and soil productivity, Cornell said.\n\n\"Now, you can actually be precise,\" Cornell said.\n\n![PHOTO: Spanish farmers mowing a wheat field with a red combine harvester machine of NewHolland agricultural equipment and farm machinery, during the cereal harvest period on July 5, 2023, in Horta de Sant Joan, Spain.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/tractor-farming-file-gty-jef-230723_1690144206447_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg)Spanish farmers mowing a wheat field with a red combine harvester machine of NewHolland agricultural equipment and farm machinery, during the cereal harvest period on July 5, 2023, in Horta de Sant Joan, Spain.Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAI will also be able to produce real-time yield maps, which will provide immediate feedback on how to manage that field and how the yields have impacted profitability, Cornell said. Before this existed, farmers would simply put all of their seed in a wagon with little guidelines on when and where to sow, making estimated calculations based on where the seed was placed, Cornell said.\n\nMore efficient irrigation will be another benefit of AI in the agriculture industry.\n\nThe United Soybean Board is currently working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to put cameras on tall poles, essentially using facial recognition technology to \"get a real-time data analysis of the field,\" which will use billions of photos being taken constantly to create a 3D image, Cornell said.\n\nThose images will allow farmers to look at weed species and density and estimate things like cover crop growth, insect infestations and leaf curl, which happens when plants begin to dry up, Cornell said.\n\nFarmers will be able to save water by using that imagery to determine the areas that need the most moisture, rather than simply relying on weather forecasts or spraying the entire field, he said.\n\nNot only will they be able to irrigate fields more efficiently, but they will also be able to see in real-time which plants are responding to the irrigation.\n\n\"That would be a huge benefit to farmers,\" he said.\n\n[MORE: Dispute over threat of extinction posed by artificial intelligence looms over surging industry\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/dispute-threat-extinction-posed-ai-looms-surging-industry/story?id=101495898)### Mitigate greenhouse gas emissions throughout the supply chain\n\nThe power of AI and the number of human hours that will be saved by the technology can also apply to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions along each step of the supply chain, Saleh ElHattab, founder of Gravity Climate, a consulting firm that helps industrial businesses and their supply chain partners manage their carbon footprint, told ABC News.\n\nElHattab described the emissions that live along the supply chain as \"persnickety\" due to the inability of the average consumer to identify and make mitigation efforts that would make a difference, such as emissions released during the manufacturing process.\n\nUsing AI to identify where emissions occur along the supply chain is important because 50 to 90% of people's emissions are outside of their own operation boundary, whether it occurs upstream or downstream of them, ElHattab said.\n\nUnprocessed data extraction that in the past could only be done manually, such as reading data from a receipt or utility bill, will be delegated to AI. Transforming what before was a heavy consultative process to an automated one will allow employees at environmental consulting firms to do the legwork in carbon footprint savings in a \"scaled-up way\" and also make it cheaper, allowing smaller businesses to access their services, ElHattab said.\n\n\"It used to be that supply chains were filled with organizations that couldn't participate because of the labor it would take,\" he said. \"The labor quotient has plummeted thanks to AI as of late.\"\n\n![PHOTO: Paper mills spew smoke in Muzaffarnagar District, Uttar Pradesh, India, Nov. 20, 2022.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/carbon-emissions-01-file-gty-jef-230723_1690144714089_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg)Paper mills spew smoke in Muzaffarnagar District, Uttar Pradesh, India, Nov. 20, 2022.Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILEWith carbon accounting, there are several efficiencies that have not yet displayed the trickle-down effect of footprint reduction, ElHattab said. Historically, humans would need to sift through several variables of datasets to figure out why.\n\n\"You've certainly seen accountants have stacks of papers that they're constantly toiling through to pull out the relevant fields and populate different systems,\" he said. \"That's no different from the world of carbon accounting.\"\n\nAnother important way AI will help to carbon correct the supply chain is by optimizing operations at manufacturing facilities, ElHattab said. Using optimizations on how manufacturing companies are running their existing equipment could save between 20% and 30% in utility cost and usage alone, he said.\n\n\"That type of insight is one that AI has led the way on,\" ElHattab said, adding that these types of technologies are starting to \"boom.\"\n\n### Preserve the world's oceans\n\nHumans know more about outer space than the oceans on Earth -- and AI will help to fill in those gaps while preserving the health of the seas, Panetta said.\n\nOne of the ways is by allowing humans to see underwater with no distortion or loss of color with robots that feature an image enhancement algorithm that Panetta created.\n\nHumans will be able to use that technology for anything from search and rescue missions to studying new and existing marine species, she said.\n\nIf aquaculture and using things like kelp and seaweed as biofuel gains traction amid the world's aim to utilize green energy, so will the technologies needed to keep underwater farms alive, Panetta said.\n\n![PHOTO: A general view shows a coral reef in Key West, Florida, on July 16, 2023.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/coral-reef-gty-jef-230723_1690144138653_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg)A general view shows a coral reef in Key West, Florida, on July 16, 2023.Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty ImagesIn the same vein, the continued installation of communications pipelines or offshore wind farms -- which in the past have been controversial due to the unknowns on how construction is affecting sensitive ecosystems such as coral beds -- will require AI utilization more in the future as companies determine where the most optimal spots to construct the massive structures will be, Panetta added. It's huge savings for businesses and a potential lifeline to the environment, she said.\n\n\"When we lay these pipelines, or we do surveys of these places, we want to see the health of the ocean and see what we're affecting,\" she said.\n\nAI can also be used to track marine life. Once whales and sharks are tagged, the camera attached to them will now be able to capture their surroundings and display them in vibrant, clear pictures. It will also help protect them from human interference.\n\nHumans will be able to track their migrations and learn more about their environment, allowing us to interfere less -- especially with fishing and aquaculture, she said.\n\n[MORE: Artificial intelligence advances fuel industry trying to preserve loved ones after death\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/ai-advances-fuel-industry-preserve-loved-after-death/story?id=101297956)"}, {"source": "University of Stirling", "title": "Research to probe impact of climate change and nitrogen pollution on soil", "link": "https://www.stir.ac.uk/news/2023/july-2023-news/research-to-probe-potentially-catastrophic-impact-of-climate-change-and-nitrogen-pollution-on-soil/", "summary": "- Dr Arthur Broadbent to lead study on mountain ecosystems\n- Mountain ecosystems are vulnerable to global environmental change, warming twice as fast as the global average\n- Agricultural and industrial pollution overloading mountain ecosystems with too much nitrogen\n- Study will address knowledge gap on belowground biodiversity and C-cycling processes in mountain soils\n- Will determine how soil biodiversity and functioning respond to multiple drivers of global change and identify synergistic effects\n- Study will take place in arctic and alpine mountain ranges and collaborate with leading researchers in Switzerland\n- University of Stirling provides excellent facilities and support for independent research fellows\n- Dr Broadbent awarded a NERC Independent Research Fellowship\n- NERC supports innovative and sustainable environmental science research", "classification": {"category": "CategoryS1", "reason": "The article discusses the study on mountain ecosystems which store soil carbon and aims to inform land managers and policy makers on how to preserve soil biodiversity and improve natural carbon storage in the face of rapid climate change."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses the study on mountain ecosystems and the importance of preserving soil biodiversity and improving natural carbon storage in the face of rapid climate change."}, "content": "\nDr Arthur Broadbent, who is joining the University of Stirling in January, will lead the study which is funded by a grant of almost \u00a3700,000 awarded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).\n\n\nDr Broadbent said: \u201cMountain ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity and store significant amounts of soil carbon.

In the ongoing debate over the promises, merits and pitfalls of [different sources of protein](http://www.ipes-food.org/pages/politicsofprotein), for example, details like [carbon emissions](https://www.sei.org/perspectives/move-beyond-carbon-tunnel-vision/), [productivity](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1e3f/meta) and [efficiency](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-022-02128-8) have become the primary \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 benchmarks used to evaluate and compare solutions. While these matter, there are additional factors that deserve as much, if not more, consideration.\n\n\n\nIn particular, two questions need to be asked far more often than they currently are if we want to transform our food systems in service of society and the planet. \n\n\n\n\nFirst, how does a solution affect the connection among people, their food and where that food comes from? \n\n\n\n\nSecond, how does it affect who has control over, and who can participate in, food production and distribution?\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nPeople [often ask me](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/is-it-wrong-to-eat-meat-1.5225354) for my take on technologies such as lab-grown meats. Unfortunately, I often disappoint those looking for an ally or a simple answer by starting with an enthusiastic, \u201cIt depends!\u201d This is because the principal challenges facing our food systems are not technological in nature. Rather, they are political and economic. Impacts on climate, biodiversity and poverty are all far more a product of [how our food systems are organized](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-021-10282-2) than of the tools we are using.\n\n\nWe lose so much when we don\u2019t interact with the plants, animals, people and places involved in cultivating and harvesting our food.\n\n\n\n\nOur food systems are wreaking havoc on our climate, landscapes and seascapes because they separate us from one another and from the lands, waters, plants, animals and ecological processes that make food production possible. Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides [mask the needs and health of the soil](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/to-feed-the-world-sustainably-repair-the-soil/) and surrounding ecosystem. Complex and lengthy supply chains, proprietary technologies,and [closed-door facilities disconnect us from the unethical treatment of animals](https://doi.org/10.1080/10282580.2016.1168257). Colonial systems of appropriation and development have privatized and commodified [food](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40971301), [seeds](https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/2659.htm) and the [land](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27771619), leaving most of us beholden to the agendas of a handful of large agribusiness firms and a globalized supply chain that is vulnerable to all manner of disruptions. So, when it comes to evaluating the merits of new solutions, starting with an outcome such as greenhouse gas emissions or productivity per acre misses a much bigger picture. \n\n\n\n\n**Building Connections**\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the first question I ask of a new technology or practice is what it will mean for the relationship among people, their food and where it is produced. Will this new tool or technology further disconnect people from where, when and how food is produced? Or will it empower them to be more closely involved and invested? \n\n\n\n\n[Distancing and disconnection](https://canadianfoodstudies.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/cfs/article/view/442) are among the most fundamental problems in our current food systems. We lose so much when we don\u2019t interact with the plants, animals, people and places involved in cultivating and harvesting our food. We lose the opportunity to gain and grow our knowledge and understanding, whether of ecology and biology or our traditional cultural histories and practices. And we lose voice, because if we cannot see the mistreatment of animals, soil or water, we\u2019re less likely to speak out against them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://ensia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/inline-optin-sunset.png)\n\nThe planet\u2019s most important stories \u2014 delivered to your inbox\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBe the first to hear about important new environmental stories.

Some technologies are inclined to create more distance between the eater and the eaten, while others increase involvement, awareness and knowledge. Lab-grown proteins seem a straightforward example of the former. Mainstream consumers are already quite distanced from the animals that provide the meats they buy at a grocer and from the lands on which those animals graze, the waters in which they swim, and the fields that provide their feed. Growing meat in a lab adds yet more steps and more levels of abstraction. It disembodies the protein, literally and figuratively, and obscures the life that made the food possible by producing placeless and lifeless products with no traceable connection to any rangeland, forest or fishery. \n\n\n\n\nThe cultural alienation from the rest of nature that Western society has developed already is widely recognized as one of the [deepest underpinnings of our contemporary ecological crises](https://ensia.com/voices/its-time-for-a-new-story-of-humanitys-place-in-the-world/). These technologies may have some merit in highly unique settings where there are few other options, such as building food systems for [space travel](https://ecwpress.com/products/dinner-on-mars). But at a time when we should be rebuilding our relationships with nature here on Earth, it is hard to imagine how lab-grown meat can do anything but worsen our problems.\n\n\n\n\n**People\u2019s Power**\n\n\n\n\nThe second question I ask is what the solution might mean for people\u2019s rights and empowerment. Will it make it easier for those with power and wealth to enclose \u2014 gain control over \u2014 land, natural resources, food production, the supply chain and all of the decisions and standards therein? [Enclosure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X15000743) and [consolidation](https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/331) in the food system engenders inequity, erodes rights and disempowers people from having a say in their food system. And the more our food is enclosed and commodified, the more [people are transformed from citizens to consumers](https://orionmagazine.org/article/forget-shorter-showers/), in that \u201cvoting with our dollar\u201d becomes the only remaining venue for us to influence how our food systems operate, and [a weak and inequitable one at that](https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/1151). \n\n\n\n\nOn this question, the answer regarding lab-grown meats is also relatively clear: Moving more aspects of how our food is produced into privatized labs using proprietary processes and technologies [clearly poses a threat](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00609-5) to people\u2019s rights and well-being.\n\n\nEmancipating our food systems from enclosure, and reconnecting consumers with ecosystems and the people working in and with those ecosystems to produce food, go hand in hand.\n\n\n\n\nIt is not necessarily the case that \u201chigh-tech\u201d solutions always cause enclosure. People have experimented, for example, with [open-source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03066150.2013.875897) and [public-funding](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/gmcr.19144) models for genetic modification technologies that do not turn seeds into the intellectual property of corporations and have the potential to keep farmers with local ecological knowledge engaged in the process. But developing these novel social approaches requires that we remain hyper-attentive to the social and political power and implications of new technologies, especially in the [context of capitalism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2022.2099739).\n\n\n\n\n**Letting Values Drive Technology**\n\n\n\n\nEmancipating our food systems from enclosure, and reconnecting consumers with ecosystems and the people working in and with those ecosystems to produce food, go hand in hand. This has [long been the mission of place-based smallholder and community food movements](https://meridian.allenpress.com/human-organization/article-abstract/59/2/177/72716/Tasting-Food-Tasting-Sustainability-Defining-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext) \u2014 to shorten supply chains and increase transparency and trust, and in so doing, empower people to produce and consume food in ways that are [culturally appropriate](https://revistabionatura.com/2020.05.01.2.php), [ecologically regenerative](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/46819) and [socially just](https://canadianfoodstudies.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/cfs/article/view/452). \n\n\n\n\nYet, smallholder production is not a silver bullet: Different technologies and cropping systems thrive and fail at different scales, and just because our current large-scale practices for commodity crops are mired in enclosure and disconnection does not mean that necessarily has to be the case. For example, [agricultural cooperatives](https://learningstore.extension.wisc.edu/products/exploring-cooperatives-economic-democracy-and-community-development-in-pennsylvania-and-wisconsin-p1816), member-owned businesses where producers pool their resources in a specific area to generate greater productivity or competitive advantage than they can on their own, are a strategy for splitting the difference between the benefits of large-scale production and [smallholder empowerment and livelihood security](https://doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aau114). \n\n\n\n\nWe need to get creative. Transforming our food systems is not merely a matter of this technology or that, [this scale or that](https://ensia.com/voices/food-production-regenerative-agriculture-scale/). It is first and foremost an exercise in setting and following our values for how, through food, we want to relate to one another and to the land. Getting caught up in debates about which product has the better life cycle analysis or lowest carbon footprint or highest calorie-per-acre yield is distracting us from solving the root causes of the challenges we face.

JPMorgan also cautioned that voluntary markets\r\nare \"not a substitute for robust public policies designed to\r\naddress climate change.\"\n\n\nUnder JPMorgan's analysis, carbon markets provide benefits\r\nto the global effort to reduce carbon emissions beyond those\r\noffered by regulatory programs for three major reasons. First, they\r\nallow companies in industries that face challenges in reducing\r\ntheir carbon emissions where, for instance, \"the technologies\r\nnecessary to address emissions may not yet be commercially\r\navailable or else may still be prohibitively expensive,\" to\r\noffset their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits,\r\nthereby \"enabling greater deployment of climate solutions\r\nelsewhere in the economy.\" Second, by incentivizing\r\ninvestment, carbon markets \"facilitate more rapid deployment\r\nof proven solutions, which can drive down net emissions more\r\nquickly.\" Third, investing in projects via carbon credits can\r\npromote other environmentally friendly actions, including\r\nreforestation efforts, or a slowing of deforestation, which\r\nincreases biodiversity, reduces other forms of pollution, and\r\npromotes stronger environmental resilience.\n\n\nStill, JPMorgan recognized that carbon markets and the use of\r\ncarbon credits may not be adopted on a global scale and across all\r\nindustries as quickly as necessary to maintain net-zero targets\r\nwithout other efforts. Accordingly, it advises that companies\r\nshould still devise business strategies and invest in technologies\r\nthat will directly reduce their carbon emissions. While these\r\nactions may impose significant short-term capital expenses, they\r\nwill likely increase business efficiency and reduce long-term\r\ncosts, according to the bank. JPMorgan also cautioned that\r\nvoluntary markets are \"not a substitute for robust public\r\npolicies designed to address climate change.\"\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon markets provide for trading two main forms\r\nof credits: (a) avoidance credits and (b) removal credits.\r\nAvoidance credits are created when a company takes an action that\r\neither fully prevents or reduces the amount of carbon it normally\r\nwould have produced under business operations. For example,\r\ncompanies can generate these types of credits by transitioning to\r\nsolar energy or by taking actions to reduce deforestation. Removal\r\ncredits, on the other hand, are created when a company actively\r\npromotes removal of GHGs from the atmosphere. This can be\r\naccomplished through a variety of options, including nature-based\r\nsolutions like reforestation, or through technological developments\r\nlike investments in, or promoting the use of, carbon-capture\r\ntechnology. JPMorgan noted that while nature-based solutions like\r\nreforestation tend to be more readily accessible and cheaper, they\r\nonly store carbon for short periods of time. Technology like\r\ncarbon-capture provides long-term removal of GHGs from the\r\natmosphere, but tends to be expensive and is not yet fully\r\ndeveloped.\n\n\nAvoidance credits and removal credits work in tandem to\r\ncomplement each other. In the near-term, avoidance credits reduce\r\nthe amount of GHGs released and slow the accumulation of carbon in\r\nthe atmosphere. In the long-term, deployment of more expensive\r\ncarbon-capture technology has the potential to partially reverse\r\nhistoric GHG emissions and counteract the continued release of GHGs\r\nfrom industries where emissions-reduction is prohibitively\r\nexpensive or technologically difficult. As JPMorgan observed, while\r\nthe goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 will largely be accomplished\r\nthrough reducing carbon emissions, \"the large-scale removal of\r\nGHGs from the atmosphere will be [also] be necessary[.]\"\n\n\nJPMorgan also identified eight major factors it utilizes when\r\nassessing the value and utility of carbon credits, given widely\r\nrecognized issues associated with \"variation in the\r\navailability and quality of information needed to assess credit\r\nquality, resulting in a lack of confidence for many market\r\nparticipants.\" Under its framework, the GHG emission\r\nreductions underlying each carbon credit should be: (1) real and\r\nproven to have actually taken place; (2) measurable and\r\nquantifiable according to recognized methodological approaches; (3)\r\nin addition to what would have already been undertaken by the\r\ncompany; (4) unique and traceable to each initiative; (5)\r\nindependently verified by a reputable GHG accreditation program;\r\n(6) not simply a displacement of carbon emissions from one sector\r\nof the economy to another; (7) durable and long-term; and (8)\r\nequitable by promoting and supporting marginalized communities.\n\n\nJPMorgan highlighted additional challenges facing the\r\ndevelopment of effective and efficient voluntary carbon markets.\r\nThese include, in addition to a lack of quality information about\r\neach carbon credit, a scarcity of high-quality carbon credits that\r\nwould promote and support large-scale efforts at decarbonization;\r\nthe existence of \"multiple marketplaces, competing frameworks\r\nand principles;\" and an inability to \"support more\r\nsophisticated forms of trading, which limits its ability to meet\r\nthe needs of different kinds of participants. Improved trading\r\ninfrastructure and further development of advanced features such as\r\nforward market instruments and reference contracts are needed to\r\nsupport increased liquidity, transparency and risk management,\r\nwhich can contribute to greater scale and efficiency.\"\n\n\n**Taking the Temperature: JPMorgan's report highlights\r\nthe potential value to companies of integrating high-quality carbon\r\ncredits into their overall sustainability plans, while also\r\nacknowledging the challenges in doing so. The integrity of carbon\r\ncredits is an ongoing source of controversy and challenge. Last\r\nyear, for instance, the Chair of the International Organization of\r\nSecurities Commissions [cited concerns](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=58&nid=11&search=carbon%20market) around the\r\n\"appropriate levels of integrity, transparency, and\r\nliquidity\" of voluntary markets.**\n\n\n**Of note, the integrity of credits traded on voluntary\r\ncarbon markets is not outside of federal regulatory oversight.\r\nEarlier this year, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading\r\nCommission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, [announced a speech](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=127&nid=28&search=carbon%20market) that the\r\nCFTC recognizes environmental products as \"commodities\"\r\nand therefore \"can play a role in voluntary [carbon] markets,\r\nand that carbon markets must be transparent and have integrity and\r\nadhere to basic market regulatory requirements.\" The CFTC\r\nChair's statement [followed a letter](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=15&nid=3&search=carbon%20market) to the CFTC\r\nsent in the fall of 2022 by a group of Democratic senators asking\r\nfor improved regulation of the market for carbon offsets. It\r\nremains unclear how the CFTC would exercise this authority in\r\npractice and what the implications are for the developments of\r\nvoluntary markets; however, the CFTC has identified as a top\r\npriority addressing financial risks posed by climate change as well\r\nas prosecuting fraud and manipulation in carbon and environmental\r\nmarkets. In June of 2023, the CFTC published guidance for\r\nwhistleblowers to report fraud in spot and forward carbon markets,\r\nand then announced the creation of an environmental fraud\r\nenforcement task force. Further, on July 19, 2023, the CFTC held\r\nits second convening to discuss the development of voluntary\r\ncarbon.

EUA prices remain resilient despite a number of potential headwinds this year. Chief amongst near-term challenges are falling gas prices that now put coal back at a competitive level.\n\n\n\u201cCarbon futures typically show a strong linkage to short-term fluctuations in energy prices,\u201d KraneShares explained. \u201cConsequently, carbon prices may rise with gas in order to maintain its advantage over coal.\u201d\n\n\nInvesting in Carbon Allowances With KraneShares\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n![Price chart of KCCA, KEUA, and KRBN YTD, the world's most liquid carbon markets. ](https://www.etftrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/KCCA_KEUA_KRBN_chart.png)\n\n\nThe**[KraneShares European Carbon Allowance ETF (KEUA)](https://etfdb.com/etf/KEUA/?__hstc=169852158.f2f5e5305706415d2602659463fc8890.1668445624576.1690381623256.1690388568028.697&__hssc=169852158.7.1690388568028&__hsfp=2968214243#etf-ticker-profile)** offers targeted exposure to the EU carbon allowances market.
