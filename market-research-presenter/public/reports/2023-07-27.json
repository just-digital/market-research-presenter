Carbon dioxide removal, as it\u2019s called, can sound like science fiction \u2014 but many companies are already counting on it to undo some of the damage caused by their pollution.\n\nCompanies might try to prevent their greenhouse gas emissions altogether, *or* they might try to clean it up after the fact. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing all kinds of brands, from [Microsoft](/2023/3/22/23651587/microsoft-climate-tech-startup-carboncapture-wyoming) to [the Houston Texans](/2023/1/9/23546460/houston-texans-nfl-offset-emissions-carbon-removal-climate-oil-occidental), saying that they\u2019ll plant trees or invest in new technologies that are supposed to filter CO2 out of the air. But even if they\u2019re successful in trapping CO2, does it reverse the consequences of creating that pollution in the first place?\n\nNot completely \u2014 at least not on a reasonable timeline, suggests a [study](http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg1801) published today in the journal *Science Advances*. It looks at the consequences carbon dioxide emissions have on an atmospheric circulation pattern called the [Hadley cell](https://www.climatesignals.org/climate-signals/hadley-cell-expansion) that has a big impact on weather across much of the world. The study shows what might happen to the world if people keep polluting willy-nilly before finding a way to take those CO2 emissions out of the atmosphere. \n\n\u201cNature is not that simple.\u201d \n\nSurprise, surprise \u2014 things don\u2019t just snap back to normal, the study finds. That shows how important it is to limit pollution now rather than waiting to clean it up later. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think that if we reduce the CO2 concentration, the atmosphere will recover to its original state,\u201d says Seo-Yeon Kim, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Seoul National University. \u201cNature is not that simple.\u201d \n\nThe Hadley cell is a defining factor for many of the world\u2019s deserts and rainforests. It moves moisture and heat between the tropics (regions closest to the equator) to the subtropics (adjacent areas further from the equator). Warm air rises in the tropics, bringing on lots of rain. The air then moves poleward to the subtropics, around 20 to 30 degrees north and south of the equator, before it comes back down as very dry air \u2014 which is why most of Earth\u2019s hot deserts lie in these subtropical regions. \n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are messing up that system. The Hadley cell is expanding, intensifying droughts in subtropical regions. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have more regions that will have become more desert-like,\u201d says Rei Chemke, an assistant professor at Weizmann Institute of Science focused on atmospheric, oceanic, and climate dynamics. \u201cEven modest changes could have large climate impact there on people.\u201d\n\nDroughts in expanding dry zones could exacerbate food and water shortages and displace people from their homes, the new paper notes. The Hadley cell has already intensified severe droughts in Chile and South Africa and affected agriculture in Southern Australia, says Richard Seager, a climate scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory.\n\nKim and her colleagues modeled what would happen if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise by 1 percent every year for the next 140 years \u2014 similar to a \u201c[high-emissions](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario/)\u201d scenario that\u2019s often described as \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d within climate research. Then, after that concentration had quadrupled, they modeled what would happen if the amount of C02 in the atmosphere dropped at the same rate over the same time period. In theory, that should cause the Hadley cell to contract \u2014 bringing its borders away from the poles back to where they were before carbon dioxide pollution shifted its boundaries.\n\nBut that\u2019s where things get a little wacky. The impact of taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere was different in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere of the planet. In the study, the northern edge of the Hadley cell moved even further south from where it used to be historically, overshooting the desired target. But the southern edge of the Hadley cell shifted much more slowly \u2014 so slow that it didn\u2019t return to its starting point. Given a couple more centuries, things could eventually shift back to normal. But in the meantime, that can make life particularly hard for people and wildlife dealing with the consequences.\n\nThings get a little wacky\n\nBoth Seager and Chemke, who were not involved in the study, say more work is needed to understand what might happen in a more realistic scenario than the one laid out in this study. Waiting 140 years before reducing carbon dioxide emissions leaves the world in a perilous place, with [weather disasters already](/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc) [becoming more frequent and extreme](/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change). It might be more helpful to policymakers to see what might happen to the Hadley cell on a shorter timeline with action taken more immediately. \n\nThere are a lot of variables to keep in mind that can lead to unexpected outcomes with efforts to take CO2 out of the atmosphere. The differences between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres\u2019 responses in the study were linked to ocean temperatures being more slow to respond to changes in CO2 concentrations, for instance. And [ozone depletion](/2023/1/10/23547383/ozone-layer-hole-healing-world-meteorological-organization) in the Southern Hemisphere also makes the Hadley cell\u2019s influence over shifting desert regions more pronounced there. \n\n### Related\n\n* [Visualizing the scale of the carbon removal problem](/2022/4/7/23013822/carbon-dioxide-removal-direct-air-capture-climate-change)\n* [Saving the forests won\u2019t be enough to stop climate change \u2014 we need substantial emission cuts](/2023/5/18/23727638/forest-carbon-capture-climate-change-study)\n\u201cThere will be surprises in what happens [when we draw CO2 down],\u201d Seager says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be equal and opposite to what happened when we started warming up the planet.\u201d\n\nTo avoid the worst effects of climate change, any efforts to take CO2 out of the atmosphere are really only supplementary at best.

JPMorgan also cautioned that voluntary markets\r\nare \"not a substitute for robust public policies designed to\r\naddress climate change.\"\n\n\nUnder JPMorgan's analysis, carbon markets provide benefits\r\nto the global effort to reduce carbon emissions beyond those\r\noffered by regulatory programs for three major reasons. First, they\r\nallow companies in industries that face challenges in reducing\r\ntheir carbon emissions where, for instance, \"the technologies\r\nnecessary to address emissions may not yet be commercially\r\navailable or else may still be prohibitively expensive,\" to\r\noffset their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits,\r\nthereby \"enabling greater deployment of climate solutions\r\nelsewhere in the economy.\" Second, by incentivizing\r\ninvestment, carbon markets \"facilitate more rapid deployment\r\nof proven solutions, which can drive down net emissions more\r\nquickly.\" Third, investing in projects via carbon credits can\r\npromote other environmentally friendly actions, including\r\nreforestation efforts, or a slowing of deforestation, which\r\nincreases biodiversity, reduces other forms of pollution, and\r\npromotes stronger environmental resilience.\n\n\nStill, JPMorgan recognized that carbon markets and the use of\r\ncarbon credits may not be adopted on a global scale and across all\r\nindustries as quickly as necessary to maintain net-zero targets\r\nwithout other efforts. Accordingly, it advises that companies\r\nshould still devise business strategies and invest in technologies\r\nthat will directly reduce their carbon emissions. While these\r\nactions may impose significant short-term capital expenses, they\r\nwill likely increase business efficiency and reduce long-term\r\ncosts, according to the bank. JPMorgan also cautioned that\r\nvoluntary markets are \"not a substitute for robust public\r\npolicies designed to address climate change.\"\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon markets provide for trading two main forms\r\nof credits: (a) avoidance credits and (b) removal credits.\r\nAvoidance credits are created when a company takes an action that\r\neither fully prevents or reduces the amount of carbon it normally\r\nwould have produced under business operations. For example,\r\ncompanies can generate these types of credits by transitioning to\r\nsolar energy or by taking actions to reduce deforestation. Removal\r\ncredits, on the other hand, are created when a company actively\r\npromotes removal of GHGs from the atmosphere. This can be\r\naccomplished through a variety of options, including nature-based\r\nsolutions like reforestation, or through technological developments\r\nlike investments in, or promoting the use of, carbon-capture\r\ntechnology. JPMorgan noted that while nature-based solutions like\r\nreforestation tend to be more readily accessible and cheaper, they\r\nonly store carbon for short periods of time. Technology like\r\ncarbon-capture provides long-term removal of GHGs from the\r\natmosphere, but tends to be expensive and is not yet fully\r\ndeveloped.\n\n\nAvoidance credits and removal credits work in tandem to\r\ncomplement each other. In the near-term, avoidance credits reduce\r\nthe amount of GHGs released and slow the accumulation of carbon in\r\nthe atmosphere. In the long-term, deployment of more expensive\r\ncarbon-capture technology has the potential to partially reverse\r\nhistoric GHG emissions and counteract the continued release of GHGs\r\nfrom industries where emissions-reduction is prohibitively\r\nexpensive or technologically difficult. As JPMorgan observed, while\r\nthe goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 will largely be accomplished\r\nthrough reducing carbon emissions, \"the large-scale removal of\r\nGHGs from the atmosphere will be [also] be necessary[.]\"\n\n\nJPMorgan also identified eight major factors it utilizes when\r\nassessing the value and utility of carbon credits, given widely\r\nrecognized issues associated with \"variation in the\r\navailability and quality of information needed to assess credit\r\nquality, resulting in a lack of confidence for many market\r\nparticipants.\" Under its framework, the GHG emission\r\nreductions underlying each carbon credit should be: (1) real and\r\nproven to have actually taken place; (2) measurable and\r\nquantifiable according to recognized methodological approaches; (3)\r\nin addition to what would have already been undertaken by the\r\ncompany; (4) unique and traceable to each initiative; (5)\r\nindependently verified by a reputable GHG accreditation program;\r\n(6) not simply a displacement of carbon emissions from one sector\r\nof the economy to another; (7) durable and long-term; and (8)\r\nequitable by promoting and supporting marginalized communities.\n\n\nJPMorgan highlighted additional challenges facing the\r\ndevelopment of effective and efficient voluntary carbon markets.\r\nThese include, in addition to a lack of quality information about\r\neach carbon credit, a scarcity of high-quality carbon credits that\r\nwould promote and support large-scale efforts at decarbonization;\r\nthe existence of \"multiple marketplaces, competing frameworks\r\nand principles;\" and an inability to \"support more\r\nsophisticated forms of trading, which limits its ability to meet\r\nthe needs of different kinds of participants. Improved trading\r\ninfrastructure and further development of advanced features such as\r\nforward market instruments and reference contracts are needed to\r\nsupport increased liquidity, transparency and risk management,\r\nwhich can contribute to greater scale and efficiency.\"\n\n\n**Taking the Temperature: JPMorgan's report highlights\r\nthe potential value to companies of integrating high-quality carbon\r\ncredits into their overall sustainability plans, while also\r\nacknowledging the challenges in doing so. The integrity of carbon\r\ncredits is an ongoing source of controversy and challenge. Last\r\nyear, for instance, the Chair of the International Organization of\r\nSecurities Commissions [cited concerns](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=58&nid=11&search=carbon%20market) around the\r\n\"appropriate levels of integrity, transparency, and\r\nliquidity\" of voluntary markets.**\n\n\n**Of note, the integrity of credits traded on voluntary\r\ncarbon markets is not outside of federal regulatory oversight.\r\nEarlier this year, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading\r\nCommission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, [announced a speech](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=127&nid=28&search=carbon%20market) that the\r\nCFTC recognizes environmental products as \"commodities\"\r\nand therefore \"can play a role in voluntary [carbon] markets,\r\nand that carbon markets must be transparent and have integrity and\r\nadhere to basic market regulatory requirements.\" The CFTC\r\nChair's statement [followed a letter](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=15&nid=3&search=carbon%20market) to the CFTC\r\nsent in the fall of 2022 by a group of Democratic senators asking\r\nfor improved regulation of the market for carbon offsets. It\r\nremains unclear how the CFTC would exercise this authority in\r\npractice and what the implications are for the developments of\r\nvoluntary markets; however, the CFTC has identified as a top\r\npriority addressing financial risks posed by climate change as well\r\nas prosecuting fraud and manipulation in carbon and environmental\r\nmarkets. In June of 2023, the CFTC published guidance for\r\nwhistleblowers to report fraud in spot and forward carbon markets,\r\nand then announced the creation of an environmental fraud\r\nenforcement task force.

changing climate is hurting infrastructure and the national economy, members of a U.S. Senate panel and experts said Wednesday.\n\n\nMembers of both parties on the U.S. Senate Budget Committee agreed at a Wednesday hearing on the need for more resilient infrastructure that could withstand the pressures of a changing climate. They also agreed speeding up the process for gaining federal approval for large infrastructure and energy projects would be helpful.\n\n\nDemocrats voiced support for taking steps to reduce carbon emissions, while Republicans mostly ignored that issue or said it would be a waste. Among those testifying was Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, who said his state is particularly vulnerable to climate change and contributes more carbon emissions than most states.\n\n\nU.S. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sheldon Whitehouse cited several examples from across the country of extreme weather damaging infrastructure.\n\n\nExcessive heat has led to roads buckling in Oregon, Texas and Utah, he said. Utilities have preemptively shut off power lines to avoid wildfires in the West. Drought in the Midwest brought water levels so low that river barges got stuck.\n\n\nThose examples and others hurt economic activity, Whitehouse said.\n\n\nThe Rhode Island Democrat advocated for a two-track approach to build more resilient power lines, bridges, sewer systems, levees and other infrastructure, and to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\n\n\u201cRepeatedly, this committee has heard expert testimony about the massive economic and fiscal costs of dawdling,\u201d he said. \u201cThose dangers are clear and present. I hope that the message is getting through: This is real.\u201d\n\n\nWhitehouse praised state-level efforts in Louisiana for its coastal resiliency planning and Iowa for promoting wind power. Nearly two-thirds of Iowa\u2019s energy production now comes from wind, Whitehouse said.\n\n\n#### Republicans question priorities\n\n\nThe ranking Republican on the panel, Iowa\u2019s Chuck Grassley, said he was supportive of climate change policies \u2014 including the wind power tax credit he championed that was helpful to his state\u2019s wide-scale adoption of wind energy \u2014 but that the committee was overly focused on the issue.\n\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing was one in a series held by Whitehouse, known as one of the Senate\u2019s most aggressive climate hawks, while the core mission of the Budget Committee has gone unaddressed, Grassley said.\n\n\n\u201cOur nation is over $32 trillion in debt, yet this committee is holding the 11th hearing on climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cOur spending is out of control and Democrats haven\u2019t written a budget in the past two years.\u201d\n\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, characterized attempts to limit carbon emissions as useless.\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the law Democrats [passed last year](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-passes-major-health-tax-and-climate-bill-boost-democrats) that includes hundreds of billions for renewable energy tax credits and other climate priorities \u2014 could cost the federal government $1.2 trillion, according to some estimates, Johnson said.\n\n\n\u201cI have no idea where that money\u2019s going to be spent,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be spent trying to mitigate climate change, I would argue it\u2019s probably going to be misspent because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we can really do to hold back the tides.\u201d\n\n\nThe government should instead spend a fraction of that money to make sure the electric grid is reliable and resilient, even in the face of natural disasters, Johnson said.\n\n\n#### \u2018Both fronts\u2019\n\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Edwards told senators he has prioritized both limiting emissions and preparing infrastructure for extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, that are linked to climate change.\n\n\nAsked by Johnson if it wouldn\u2019t be more effective to focus on infrastructure resilience rather than limiting carbon emissions, Edwards said he had a difference of opinion with Johnson.\n\n\n\u201cI think we need to be acting on both fronts,\u201d he said.\n\n\nJohnson implied that a U.S. transition away from fossil fuels would not affect the carbon emissions of rapidly developing countries like China and India. Limiting fossil fuel production ignores the current economic reality, he said.\n\n\nBut Edwards said looking to renewable energy sources would be a wise long-term strategy.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an enemy of fossil fuels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been a fossil fuel state for over 100 years. But it\u2019s clear to me if we\u2019re going to be an energy state in the next 50 years, we\u2019re going to embrace the transition. We will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, increase our reliance on clean energy such as wind.\u201d\n\n\n#### Hopes remain for permitting overhaul\n\n\nThe [debt limit deal](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default) that Congress [passed this year](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-biden-debt-limit-legislation-ahead-monday-default-deadline) included some changes to how federal agencies grant environmental approvals for infrastructure and energy projects.\n\n\nBut those changes were insufficient to speed up projects that are hampered by administrative delays and legal challenges, according to Alex Herrgott, the leader of The Permitting Institute, a group that advocates for easier permitting requirements.\n\n\nTo see real change, lawmakers would have to alter bedrock environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, and the Clean Water Act, he said.\n\n\n\u201cIn practice, developers will still experience most of the same obstacles and avoidable process delays that have plagued the system for decades,\u201d Herrgott told the panel. \u201cTruly impactful legislation will have to move beyond macro-level NEPA changes and untangle the web of confusion and uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\nHerrgott, who led the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council under former President Donald Trump, said the issue was nonpartisan.\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a Republican or a Democrat issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a process issue we can fix.\u201d\n\n\nWhitehouse said he had \u201cnot given up hope on bipartisan permitting reform\u201d passing Congress this year.\n\n\nSeveral Democrats on the panel, including Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, said renewable energy projects and their associated transmission lines, as well as resilient infrastructure projects, were stymied by a lengthy permitting process.\n\n\n\u201cI think many Democrats want to do permitting reform,\u201d Kaine said.\n\n\nRepublicans on the panel also said they supported a permitting overhaul as part of a climate change agenda.\n\n\n\u201cJust like fossil fuel projects, renewable projects, face years of permitting delays,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t permitting reform be at the top list of anyone concerned about climate change?\u201d\n\n\n"}, {"source": "Scientific American", "title": "Forests Are Losing Their Ability to Hold Carbon", "link": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/forests-are-losing-their-ability-to-hold-carbon/", "summary": "- Error 403 Forbidden\n- Error 54113\n- Details: cache-bfi-kbfi7400091-BFI 1690424143 268470873\n- Varnish cache server", "classification": {"category": "CategoryO1", "reason": "The article does not seem to be related to carbon."}, "sentiment": {"score": 1, "reason": "The article does not provide any sentiment or information related to removing carbon from the atmosphere or preventing carbon emissions.

Five years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have anticipated that.\u201d\n\n\nMoyer explained the mission of the CAPC and its successor created by Town Meeting \u2014 the Climate Action Commission \u2014 gave a brief history of Hingham climate action successes, and also shared what the plan does and doesn\u2019t do and its structure, including a carbon inventory.\n\n\nThe CAPC\u2019s charge was to evaluate a wide range of carbon emission reduction strategies and to propose measures to achieve a zero sum of carbon emissions produced and taken out of the atmosphere (i.e., \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions) by the year 2040 or another target date deemed feasible.\n\n\nThe CAC\u2019s role is to support, oversee, and report on the progress of the implementation of the town\u2019s Climate Action Plan.  \n\nThese efforts include:\n\n\n* investigating the feasibility of new technologies and best practices as applied to  \n\nHingham and to update the Climate Action Plan accordingly;\n* providing support to town committees and other municipal government entities as they work to act on recommendations to reduce carbon emissions;\n* working with businesses, residents, and organizations in town to help educate, support, and encourage adoption of low-carbon and no-carbon technologies; and\n* regularly disseminating information on the town\u2019s progress toward Net Zero carbon emissions.\n\n\nA survey to which there were 362 responses helped identify concerns and opportunities that the plan seeks to address. The CAPC also held 40 public meetings, three public engagement sessions, three Select Board presentations, and three presentations to other town entities along with making two presentations to community groups, holding two public events, and having three articles published.\n\n\nMoyer also explained what the plan does and doesn\u2019t do. \u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t obligate anyone to anything, mandate budget expenditures, or supplant normal town and approval processes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to action, and what it does do is make recommendations and ask residents, businesses and non-profits, and town government to consider actions to reduce carbon emissions.\u201d\n\n\nThe plan also recognizes economics and changes in technology and mandates continued refinement and growth. \u201cIt\u2019s a living document, and we need to mind it and watch it,\u201d Moyer said.\n\n\nThe plan is \u201cdeep, but accessible \u2014 it\u2019s digestible,\u201d he explained. He went on to explain how to review it and how to access the detailed recommendations, the body of the plan, and the carbon inventory containing a detailed analysis and list of assumptions as to how to calculate carbon emissions in the town, using the most recent data available from 2021.\n\n\nThe contours of the plan include electricity supply, buildings, transportation, waste, community outreach, air quality, and \u201cpublic pathways,\u201d natural resources including land conservation and management, and implementation.\n\n\nThe document also provides examples of potential grants and funding opportunities.\n\n\n\u201cI look forward to implementation of the plan and learning more about grant opportunities,\u201d Select Board Chair Liz Klein said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to digest.\u201d\n\n\nSelect Board member Joseph Fisher said he\u2019s impressed with the passion of the group of residents who comprise the committee and commission.\n\n\n**Climate change concerns brought up**  \n\nFellow board member William Ramsey asked about steps that could be taken to protect the town\u2019s infrastructure from the impacts of sea level rise and other climate change threats.\n\n\n\u201cHow are we going to protect our roadways and the downtown corridor, which are very much in jeopardy \u2014 including residences, businesses, and the sewer system?\u201d he asked.\n\n\nWhile how to reduce carbon emissions was the CAPC\u2019s main charge, Moyer agreed this is an important issue.\n\n\nCAPC member Henry Hidell agreed that protecting the infrastructure \u201cis a big deal\u201d and urged the formation of a long-range committee as soon as possible to begin addressing immediate needs and to identify short- and long-term issues. \u201cWe need to begin this process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\n\nPlanning Board member Gary Tondorf-Dick praised Moyer for his leadership \u201cof this talented group that studied this complex issue.\u201d\n\n\nKlein said she\u2019s confident the plan will be implemented and that \u201cit will not sit on a shelf.\u201d\n\n\n"}], [{"source": "JD Supra", "title": "Science-Based Targets Initiative Releases Consultation Papers for Financial Institutions, Highlights Need for ...", "link": "https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/science-based-targets-initiative-7671856/", "summary": "- Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) published draft Financial Institutions Net Zero (FINZ) Standard.\n- FINZ Standard sets criteria for financial institutions towards climate-neutrality.\n- Objectives include ceasing support for new high-emitting projects, decarbonizing existing portfolios, and supporting net-zero activities.\n- SBTi also published Position Paper on Fossil Fuel Finance, advocating for halting fossil fuel financing.\n- SBTi released updated Near-Term Financial Sector Science Based Targets Guidance.\n- Public consultation on draft papers open until August 14, 2023.\n- SBTi's focus reflects the importance of the financial sector in climate change efforts globally.\n- United Nations forms working group on nature- and biodiversity-related target setting in the banking sector.\n- Investment gap in renewable and clean energy in ASEAN region addressed in a recent report.\n- Financing discussed at COP27 climate change conference, COP15 biodiversity conference, and G20 Finance Ministers meeting.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryS1", "reason": "The article discusses the draft Financial Institutions Net Zero (FINZ) Standard and the science-based targets framework for financial institutions to achieve net-zero emissions."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article contains positive sentiment as it discusses the draft FINZ Standard and the Science Based Targets initiative, which aim to establish targets for financial institutions to achieve net-zero emissions."}, "content": "![Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP](/img/client_headers/Cadwalader/MainHeader.jpg)\n\n\nIn June 2023, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) **[published a draft](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/The-SBTi-Financial-Institutions-Net-Zero-Standard-Consultation-Draft.pdf)** of its Financial Institutions Net Zero (FINZ) Standard to enable financial institutions to establish targets consistent with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. The SBTi framework aims to foster a globally standardized approach for reporting and assessment for financial institutions.\n\n\nThe consultation draft on the FINZ Standard sets out the framework and what it labels as high-level criteria for financial institutions advancing towards climate-neutrality. The FINZ Standard outlines three main objectives for the finance sector, namely that financial institutions cease financial support for new high-emitting projects; focus on decarbonizing existing portfolios through transition financing; and support activities aligned with net-zero emissions targets. The FINZ Standard provides that a financial institution\u2019s complete net-zero framework should include 5-10 year near-term science-based targets that allocate a greater allocation of financial resources towards 1.5\u00b0C pathways, complemented by long-term science-based targets to achieve complete net-zero alignment by 2050.\n\n\nIn parallel, the SBTi also published its **[Position Paper on Fossil Fuel Finance](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/The-SBTi-Fossil-Fuel-Finance-Position-Paper-Consultation-Draft.pdf)**, which details the criteria for financial institutions\u2019 activities with fossil fuel companies and projects. The position paper advocates for the immediate halt of fossil fuel financing and encourages financial institutions to engage with fossil fuel companies to transition to a net-zero economy. The recommendations set out in the position paper include: (1) publicly disclosing climate-related information annually, including GHG emissions, financial exposures, and transition plans of fossil fuel portfolio companies; (2) immediately ending new financial investments in the coal value chain and unabated oil and gas activities at project level; (3) setting targets for financial support for existing fossil fuel activities at the company and portfolio levels, aiming for a 1.5\u00b0C transition; and (4) committing to phasing out financial activities linked to unaligned companies and projects within specified timeframes.\n\n\nIn addition, SBTi also released updated **[Near-Term Financial Sector Science Based Targets Guidance](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/Near-Term-Financial-Sector-Science-Based-Targets-Guidance-V2-Consultation-Draft.pdf)**. The key updates are the inclusion of fossil fuel finance items in the near-term and a requirement for financial institutions to align their scope 1 and 2 targets to a 1.5\u00b0C climate transition with a 5-10 year timeframe (as opposed to the previous version\u2019s requirement of \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d for scope 1 and 2 targets with a timeframe of 5-15 years). This increased ambition, as SBTi reports, is in line with the fact that a majority of financial institutions already are aligning their near-term targets with the 1.5\u00b0C climate scenario. The guidance offers recommendations for communicating targets and actions, examples of actions to achieve targets, and instructions for committing to the SBTi and submitting targets for validation.\n\n\nThe draft papers are open for public consultation and stakeholder engagement until August 14, 2023. The complete FINZ Standard together with tools and guidance on how to implement the standard is expected to be published in 2024.\n\n\n**Taking the Temperature: The SBTi\u2019s focus on the financial sector reflects that industry\u2019s importance to climate change efforts globally, particularly with respect to financing renewable energy projects. We [recently reported](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=290&nid=67) on the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment\u2019s (CCSI) research report, which also focuses on financial institutions and their climate-action initiatives, and emphasizes the need for a significant increase in non-fossil fuel investments. In that vein, on May 4, 2023, the United Nations [announced the formation](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=275&nid=64&search=financing) of a 35-member bank-led working group to promote nature- and biodiversity-related target setting, and part of the group\u2019s mandate is to focus on how the banking sector can close the biodiversity financing gap.

Experts weigh in\n-------------------------------------------------------](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai/story?id=99919927)This is how scientists say AI will help efforts to save the environment:\n\n### Detecting permafrost melting in the Arctic\n\nThe Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the earth since 1979, according to a study published in [Communications Earth & Environment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3#:%7E:text=During%201979%E2%80%932021%2C%20major%20portions,fast%20as%20the%20global%20average.) in 2022. While all that melting is putting Arctic species at risk and increasing the possibility of pollution and environmental disasters as shipping lanes once blocked by ice open up, it is also putting human lives at risk, researchers said.\n\nGoogle has granted $5 million to the Woodwell Climate Research Center to support the development of an open-access resource that will allow residents in the Arctic to track permafrost thaw in real-time. The tracking tool will combine satellite technology with AI to provide potentially life-saving information to residents whose homes could be on the brink of collapsing with the land beneath it, Anna Liljedahl, an associate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told ABC News.\n\nWhile traditional remote sensing methods applied to satellite imagery would fall short, AI technology similar to facial recognition is being used to map out ice-wedge polygons beneath the ground -- \"ambiguous\" features that satellites would not be able to pick up \u2013 in similar ways to how it can detect degrading glaciers, Liljedahl said.\n\n\"With permafrost, we have to look at indirect signals because it's hidden in the ground,\" she said.\n\n![PHOTO: This picture taken on May 6, 2022 shows an anti-avalanche wall that was built to protect the houses in Longyearbyen, northern Norway.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/permafrost-town-sweden-file-gty-jef-230723_1690144206430_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg)This picture taken on May 6, 2022 shows an anti-avalanche wall that was built to protect the houses in Longyearbyen, northern Norway.Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty ImagesResearchers have found that the melting is so intense in some spots, it has essentially created a \"permafrost soup,\" in which there is a lot of water beneath where ice once stood, increasing the risk that the topography will cave in, she said.\n\n\"It's already causing big trouble for people living in the Arctic and their houses and roads and industry as well,\" Liljedahl said.\n\nMelting permafrost has been so severe in [Point Lay in northwest Alaska](https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2022/9/highlight/2) that water lines built into the ground shifted and broke, causing the hospital to go without water for a week in 2021, Liljedahl said.\n\nThe tool will allow communities living on Arctic permafrost to plan adequately for residents' safety and enable policymakers to make better decisions on the kinds of goals that countries should implement to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, Liljedahl said. The permafrost discovery gateway is using so many large datasets that it would crash a regular computer, Liljedahl said.\n\n\"We are creating here this easy-to-use tool so they can look at their community and look at their surroundings and have access to information to say, 'This would be a good location to perhaps move to,'\" Liljedahl said.\n\nIn addition, the emissions currently being tracked by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do not account for the emissions that are released due to falling Arctic permafrost, making the tracking of the melting even more critical, Liljedahl said.\n\n[MORE: Biden White House, tech companies launch new safeguards around emerging AI technology\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-white-house-tech-companies-launch-new-safeguards/story?id=101555314)### Ensure the world's food supply\n\nThe agricultural industry is one of the most labor-intensive -- and most important -- systems in the world. As global temperatures continue to rise, the world's food supply is expected to be jeopardized by an increase in severe weather events such as extreme flooding, prolonged drought and heat waves and even an [increase in plant pathogens](https://abcnews.go.com/US/climate-change-plant-pathogens-infect-crops-higher-rates/story?id=79267388) that could create widespread destruction of crops, experts say.\n\n\"If you're thinking about an industry that is most impacted by climate change, agriculture is probably the leading place,\" Jack Cornell, director of sustainable supply for the United Soybean Board, governing body for the U.S. commodity checkoff program for soybeans, said.\n\nAI will help to combat those stressors and make growing food more efficient while reducing its carbon footprint, Cornell told ABC News.\n\nOne of the biggest ways AI will help to reduce the harmful impacts of farming for the masses is determining when and where to place fertilizer, Cornell said.\n\nFarmers who previously drove a tractor for four hours, laying down fertilizer as they go, will now be able to utilize auto-steer technology that leads them to the exact spot that needs the fertilizer instead, which will prevent underusing or overusing the substance.\n\nVariable rate technology, a process in which AI will estimate how much to increase or reduce fertilizer based on computer modeling of soil and yield maps, will also allow farmers to determine how much to reduce or increase fertilizer based on the health of the soil and soil productivity, Cornell said.\n\n\"Now, you can actually be precise,\" Cornell said.\n\n![PHOTO: Spanish farmers mowing a wheat field with a red combine harvester machine of NewHolland agricultural equipment and farm machinery, during the cereal harvest period on July 5, 2023, in Horta de Sant Joan, Spain.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/tractor-farming-file-gty-jef-230723_1690144206447_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg)Spanish farmers mowing a wheat field with a red combine harvester machine of NewHolland agricultural equipment and farm machinery, during the cereal harvest period on July 5, 2023, in Horta de Sant Joan, Spain.Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAI will also be able to produce real-time yield maps, which will provide immediate feedback on how to manage that field and how the yields have impacted profitability, Cornell said. Before this existed, farmers would simply put all of their seed in a wagon with little guidelines on when and where to sow, making estimated calculations based on where the seed was placed, Cornell said.\n\nMore efficient irrigation will be another benefit of AI in the agriculture industry.\n\nThe United Soybean Board is currently working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to put cameras on tall poles, essentially using facial recognition technology to \"get a real-time data analysis of the field,\" which will use billions of photos being taken constantly to create a 3D image, Cornell said.\n\nThose images will allow farmers to look at weed species and density and estimate things like cover crop growth, insect infestations and leaf curl, which happens when plants begin to dry up, Cornell said.\n\nFarmers will be able to save water by using that imagery to determine the areas that need the most moisture, rather than simply relying on weather forecasts or spraying the entire field, he said.\n\nNot only will they be able to irrigate fields more efficiently, but they will also be able to see in real-time which plants are responding to the irrigation.\n\n\"That would be a huge benefit to farmers,\" he said.\n\n[MORE: Dispute over threat of extinction posed by artificial intelligence looms over surging industry\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/dispute-threat-extinction-posed-ai-looms-surging-industry/story?id=101495898)### Mitigate greenhouse gas emissions throughout the supply chain\n\nThe power of AI and the number of human hours that will be saved by the technology can also apply to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions along each step of the supply chain, Saleh ElHattab, founder of Gravity Climate, a consulting firm that helps industrial businesses and their supply chain partners manage their carbon footprint, told ABC News.\n\nElHattab described the emissions that live along the supply chain as \"persnickety\" due to the inability of the average consumer to identify and make mitigation efforts that would make a difference, such as emissions released during the manufacturing process.\n\nUsing AI to identify where emissions occur along the supply chain is important because 50 to 90% of people's emissions are outside of their own operation boundary, whether it occurs upstream or downstream of them, ElHattab said.\n\nUnprocessed data extraction that in the past could only be done manually, such as reading data from a receipt or utility bill, will be delegated to AI. Transforming what before was a heavy consultative process to an automated one will allow employees at environmental consulting firms to do the legwork in carbon footprint savings in a \"scaled-up way\" and also make it cheaper, allowing smaller businesses to access their services, ElHattab said.\n\n\"It used to be that supply chains were filled with organizations that couldn't participate because of the labor it would take,\" he said. \"The labor quotient has plummeted thanks to AI as of late.\"\n\n![PHOTO: Paper mills spew smoke in Muzaffarnagar District, Uttar Pradesh, India, Nov. 20, 2022.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/carbon-emissions-01-file-gty-jef-230723_1690144714089_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg)Paper mills spew smoke in Muzaffarnagar District, Uttar Pradesh, India, Nov. 20, 2022.Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILEWith carbon accounting, there are several efficiencies that have not yet displayed the trickle-down effect of footprint reduction, ElHattab said. Historically, humans would need to sift through several variables of datasets to figure out why.\n\n\"You've certainly seen accountants have stacks of papers that they're constantly toiling through to pull out the relevant fields and populate different systems,\" he said. \"That's no different from the world of carbon accounting.\"\n\nAnother important way AI will help to carbon correct the supply chain is by optimizing operations at manufacturing facilities, ElHattab said. Using optimizations on how manufacturing companies are running their existing equipment could save between 20% and 30% in utility cost and usage alone, he said.\n\n\"That type of insight is one that AI has led the way on,\" ElHattab said, adding that these types of technologies are starting to \"boom.\"\n\n### Preserve the world's oceans\n\nHumans know more about outer space than the oceans on Earth -- and AI will help to fill in those gaps while preserving the health of the seas, Panetta said.\n\nOne of the ways is by allowing humans to see underwater with no distortion or loss of color with robots that feature an image enhancement algorithm that Panetta created.\n\nHumans will be able to use that technology for anything from search and rescue missions to studying new and existing marine species, she said.\n\nIf aquaculture and using things like kelp and seaweed as biofuel gains traction amid the world's aim to utilize green energy, so will the technologies needed to keep underwater farms alive, Panetta said.\n\n![PHOTO: A general view shows a coral reef in Key West, Florida, on July 16, 2023.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/coral-reef-gty-jef-230723_1690144138653_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg)A general view shows a coral reef in Key West, Florida, on July 16, 2023.Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty ImagesIn the same vein, the continued installation of communications pipelines or offshore wind farms -- which in the past have been controversial due to the unknowns on how construction is affecting sensitive ecosystems such as coral beds -- will require AI utilization more in the future as companies determine where the most optimal spots to construct the massive structures will be, Panetta added. It's huge savings for businesses and a potential lifeline to the environment, she said.\n\n\"When we lay these pipelines, or we do surveys of these places, we want to see the health of the ocean and see what we're affecting,\" she said.\n\nAI can also be used to track marine life. Once whales and sharks are tagged, the camera attached to them will now be able to capture their surroundings and display them in vibrant, clear pictures. It will also help protect them from human interference.\n\nHumans will be able to track their migrations and learn more about their environment, allowing us to interfere less -- especially with fishing and aquaculture, she said.\n\n[MORE: Artificial intelligence advances fuel industry trying to preserve loved ones after death\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/ai-advances-fuel-industry-preserve-loved-after-death/story?id=101297956)"}, {"source": "University of Stirling", "title": "Research to probe impact of climate change and nitrogen pollution on soil", "link": "https://www.stir.ac.uk/news/2023/july-2023-news/research-to-probe-potentially-catastrophic-impact-of-climate-change-and-nitrogen-pollution-on-soil/", "summary": "- Dr Arthur Broadbent will lead a study on mountain ecosystems funded by a \u00a3700,000 grant from NERC.\n- Mountain ecosystems are warming twice as fast as the global average and are vulnerable to environmental change.\n- The study will address the knowledge gap on belowground biodiversity in mountain soils and its impact on carbon cycling processes.\n- Experiments will be conducted in arctic and alpine mountain ranges in collaboration with leading researchers in Switzerland.\n- The University of Stirling provides excellent facilities for conducting research.\n- Dr Broadbent is one of twelve early career researchers awarded a NERC Independent Research Fellowship.\n- NERC supports innovation and sustainability in environmental science.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryS1", "reason": "The article discusses a study on mountain ecosystems and their vulnerability to global environmental change, focusing on soil carbon and its cycling processes."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses a study on mountain ecosystems and their vulnerability to environmental change, with a focus on soil carbon and its cycling processes.

In the ongoing debate over the promises, merits and pitfalls of [different sources of protein](http://www.ipes-food.org/pages/politicsofprotein), for example, details like [carbon emissions](https://www.sei.org/perspectives/move-beyond-carbon-tunnel-vision/), [productivity](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1e3f/meta) and [efficiency](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-022-02128-8) have become the primary \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 benchmarks used to evaluate and compare solutions. While these matter, there are additional factors that deserve as much, if not more, consideration.\n\n\n\nIn particular, two questions need to be asked far more often than they currently are if we want to transform our food systems in service of society and the planet. \n\n\n\n\nFirst, how does a solution affect the connection among people, their food and where that food comes from? \n\n\n\n\nSecond, how does it affect who has control over, and who can participate in, food production and distribution?\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nPeople [often ask me](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/is-it-wrong-to-eat-meat-1.5225354) for my take on technologies such as lab-grown meats. Unfortunately, I often disappoint those looking for an ally or a simple answer by starting with an enthusiastic, \u201cIt depends!\u201d This is because the principal challenges facing our food systems are not technological in nature. Rather, they are political and economic. Impacts on climate, biodiversity and poverty are all far more a product of [how our food systems are organized](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-021-10282-2) than of the tools we are using.\n\n\nWe lose so much when we don\u2019t interact with the plants, animals, people and places involved in cultivating and harvesting our food.\n\n\n\n\nOur food systems are wreaking havoc on our climate, landscapes and seascapes because they separate us from one another and from the lands, waters, plants, animals and ecological processes that make food production possible. Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides [mask the needs and health of the soil](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/to-feed-the-world-sustainably-repair-the-soil/) and surrounding ecosystem. Complex and lengthy supply chains, proprietary technologies,and [closed-door facilities disconnect us from the unethical treatment of animals](https://doi.org/10.1080/10282580.2016.1168257). Colonial systems of appropriation and development have privatized and commodified [food](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40971301), [seeds](https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/2659.htm) and the [land](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27771619), leaving most of us beholden to the agendas of a handful of large agribusiness firms and a globalized supply chain that is vulnerable to all manner of disruptions. So, when it comes to evaluating the merits of new solutions, starting with an outcome such as greenhouse gas emissions or productivity per acre misses a much bigger picture. \n\n\n\n\n**Building Connections**\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the first question I ask of a new technology or practice is what it will mean for the relationship among people, their food and where it is produced. Will this new tool or technology further disconnect people from where, when and how food is produced? Or will it empower them to be more closely involved and invested? \n\n\n\n\n[Distancing and disconnection](https://canadianfoodstudies.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/cfs/article/view/442) are among the most fundamental problems in our current food systems. We lose so much when we don\u2019t interact with the plants, animals, people and places involved in cultivating and harvesting our food. We lose the opportunity to gain and grow our knowledge and understanding, whether of ecology and biology or our traditional cultural histories and practices. And we lose voice, because if we cannot see the mistreatment of animals, soil or water, we\u2019re less likely to speak out against them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://ensia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/inline-optin-sunset.png)\n\nThe planet\u2019s most important stories \u2014 delivered to your inbox\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBe the first to hear about important new environmental stories.

Some technologies are inclined to create more distance between the eater and the eaten, while others increase involvement, awareness and knowledge. Lab-grown proteins seem a straightforward example of the former. Mainstream consumers are already quite distanced from the animals that provide the meats they buy at a grocer and from the lands on which those animals graze, the waters in which they swim, and the fields that provide their feed. Growing meat in a lab adds yet more steps and more levels of abstraction. It disembodies the protein, literally and figuratively, and obscures the life that made the food possible by producing placeless and lifeless products with no traceable connection to any rangeland, forest or fishery. \n\n\n\n\nThe cultural alienation from the rest of nature that Western society has developed already is widely recognized as one of the [deepest underpinnings of our contemporary ecological crises](https://ensia.com/voices/its-time-for-a-new-story-of-humanitys-place-in-the-world/). These technologies may have some merit in highly unique settings where there are few other options, such as building food systems for [space travel](https://ecwpress.com/products/dinner-on-mars). But at a time when we should be rebuilding our relationships with nature here on Earth, it is hard to imagine how lab-grown meat can do anything but worsen our problems.\n\n\n\n\n**People\u2019s Power**\n\n\n\n\nThe second question I ask is what the solution might mean for people\u2019s rights and empowerment. Will it make it easier for those with power and wealth to enclose \u2014 gain control over \u2014 land, natural resources, food production, the supply chain and all of the decisions and standards therein? [Enclosure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X15000743) and [consolidation](https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/331) in the food system engenders inequity, erodes rights and disempowers people from having a say in their food system. And the more our food is enclosed and commodified, the more [people are transformed from citizens to consumers](https://orionmagazine.org/article/forget-shorter-showers/), in that \u201cvoting with our dollar\u201d becomes the only remaining venue for us to influence how our food systems operate, and [a weak and inequitable one at that](https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/1151). \n\n\n\n\nOn this question, the answer regarding lab-grown meats is also relatively clear: Moving more aspects of how our food is produced into privatized labs using proprietary processes and technologies [clearly poses a threat](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00609-5) to people\u2019s rights and well-being.\n\n\nEmancipating our food systems from enclosure, and reconnecting consumers with ecosystems and the people working in and with those ecosystems to produce food, go hand in hand.\n\n\n\n\nIt is not necessarily the case that \u201chigh-tech\u201d solutions always cause enclosure. People have experimented, for example, with [open-source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03066150.2013.875897) and [public-funding](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/gmcr.19144) models for genetic modification technologies that do not turn seeds into the intellectual property of corporations and have the potential to keep farmers with local ecological knowledge engaged in the process. But developing these novel social approaches requires that we remain hyper-attentive to the social and political power and implications of new technologies, especially in the [context of capitalism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2022.2099739).\n\n\n\n\n**Letting Values Drive Technology**\n\n\n\n\nEmancipating our food systems from enclosure, and reconnecting consumers with ecosystems and the people working in and with those ecosystems to produce food, go hand in hand. This has [long been the mission of place-based smallholder and community food movements](https://meridian.allenpress.com/human-organization/article-abstract/59/2/177/72716/Tasting-Food-Tasting-Sustainability-Defining-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext) \u2014 to shorten supply chains and increase transparency and trust, and in so doing, empower people to produce and consume food in ways that are [culturally appropriate](https://revistabionatura.com/2020.05.01.2.php), [ecologically regenerative](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/46819) and [socially just](https://canadianfoodstudies.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/cfs/article/view/452). \n\n\n\n\nYet, smallholder production is not a silver bullet: Different technologies and cropping systems thrive and fail at different scales, and just because our current large-scale practices for commodity crops are mired in enclosure and disconnection does not mean that necessarily has to be the case. For example, [agricultural cooperatives](https://learningstore.extension.wisc.edu/products/exploring-cooperatives-economic-democracy-and-community-development-in-pennsylvania-and-wisconsin-p1816), member-owned businesses where producers pool their resources in a specific area to generate greater productivity or competitive advantage than they can on their own, are a strategy for splitting the difference between the benefits of large-scale production and [smallholder empowerment and livelihood security](https://doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aau114). \n\n\n\n\nWe need to get creative. Transforming our food systems is not merely a matter of this technology or that, [this scale or that](https://ensia.com/voices/food-production-regenerative-agriculture-scale/). It is first and foremost an exercise in setting and following our values for how, through food, we want to relate to one another and to the land. Getting caught up in debates about which product has the better life cycle analysis or lowest carbon footprint or highest calorie-per-acre yield is distracting us from solving the root causes of the challenges we face. If we start instead by attending to aspirational values \u2014 such as equity, empowerment, and respect and reciprocity with the natural world \u2014 we will better see the [long-term transformative potential](http://www.ipes-food.org/pages/LongFoodMovement) of solutions [we already have in hand](https://www.ipes-food.org/_img/upload/files/sfsENhq.pdf) to build food systems that are more sustainable, regenerative and just.\n\n\n*Editor\u2019s note: The views expressed here are those of the author and not necessarily of Ensia.

JPMorgan also cautioned that voluntary markets\r\nare \"not a substitute for robust public policies designed to\r\naddress climate change.\"\n\n\nUnder JPMorgan's analysis, carbon markets provide benefits\r\nto the global effort to reduce carbon emissions beyond those\r\noffered by regulatory programs for three major reasons. First, they\r\nallow companies in industries that face challenges in reducing\r\ntheir carbon emissions where, for instance, \"the technologies\r\nnecessary to address emissions may not yet be commercially\r\navailable or else may still be prohibitively expensive,\" to\r\noffset their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits,\r\nthereby \"enabling greater deployment of climate solutions\r\nelsewhere in the economy.\" Second, by incentivizing\r\ninvestment, carbon markets \"facilitate more rapid deployment\r\nof proven solutions, which can drive down net emissions more\r\nquickly.\" Third, investing in projects via carbon credits can\r\npromote other environmentally friendly actions, including\r\nreforestation efforts, or a slowing of deforestation, which\r\nincreases biodiversity, reduces other forms of pollution, and\r\npromotes stronger environmental resilience.\n\n\nStill, JPMorgan recognized that carbon markets and the use of\r\ncarbon credits may not be adopted on a global scale and across all\r\nindustries as quickly as necessary to maintain net-zero targets\r\nwithout other efforts. Accordingly, it advises that companies\r\nshould still devise business strategies and invest in technologies\r\nthat will directly reduce their carbon emissions. While these\r\nactions may impose significant short-term capital expenses, they\r\nwill likely increase business efficiency and reduce long-term\r\ncosts, according to the bank. JPMorgan also cautioned that\r\nvoluntary markets are \"not a substitute for robust public\r\npolicies designed to address climate change.\"\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon markets provide for trading two main forms\r\nof credits: (a) avoidance credits and (b) removal credits.\r\nAvoidance credits are created when a company takes an action that\r\neither fully prevents or reduces the amount of carbon it normally\r\nwould have produced under business operations. For example,\r\ncompanies can generate these types of credits by transitioning to\r\nsolar energy or by taking actions to reduce deforestation. Removal\r\ncredits, on the other hand, are created when a company actively\r\npromotes removal of GHGs from the atmosphere. This can be\r\naccomplished through a variety of options, including nature-based\r\nsolutions like reforestation, or through technological developments\r\nlike investments in, or promoting the use of, carbon-capture\r\ntechnology. JPMorgan noted that while nature-based solutions like\r\nreforestation tend to be more readily accessible and cheaper, they\r\nonly store carbon for short periods of time. Technology like\r\ncarbon-capture provides long-term removal of GHGs from the\r\natmosphere, but tends to be expensive and is not yet fully\r\ndeveloped.\n\n\nAvoidance credits and removal credits work in tandem to\r\ncomplement each other. In the near-term, avoidance credits reduce\r\nthe amount of GHGs released and slow the accumulation of carbon in\r\nthe atmosphere. In the long-term, deployment of more expensive\r\ncarbon-capture technology has the potential to partially reverse\r\nhistoric GHG emissions and counteract the continued release of GHGs\r\nfrom industries where emissions-reduction is prohibitively\r\nexpensive or technologically difficult. As JPMorgan observed, while\r\nthe goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 will largely be accomplished\r\nthrough reducing carbon emissions, \"the large-scale removal of\r\nGHGs from the atmosphere will be [also] be necessary[.]\"\n\n\nJPMorgan also identified eight major factors it utilizes when\r\nassessing the value and utility of carbon credits, given widely\r\nrecognized issues associated with \"variation in the\r\navailability and quality of information needed to assess credit\r\nquality, resulting in a lack of confidence for many market\r\nparticipants.\" Under its framework, the GHG emission\r\nreductions underlying each carbon credit should be: (1) real and\r\nproven to have actually taken place; (2) measurable and\r\nquantifiable according to recognized methodological approaches; (3)\r\nin addition to what would have already been undertaken by the\r\ncompany; (4) unique and traceable to each initiative; (5)\r\nindependently verified by a reputable GHG accreditation program;\r\n(6) not simply a displacement of carbon emissions from one sector\r\nof the economy to another; (7) durable and long-term; and (8)\r\nequitable by promoting and supporting marginalized communities.\n\n\nJPMorgan highlighted additional challenges facing the\r\ndevelopment of effective and efficient voluntary carbon markets.\r\nThese include, in addition to a lack of quality information about\r\neach carbon credit, a scarcity of high-quality carbon credits that\r\nwould promote and support large-scale efforts at decarbonization;\r\nthe existence of \"multiple marketplaces, competing frameworks\r\nand principles;\" and an inability to \"support more\r\nsophisticated forms of trading, which limits its ability to meet\r\nthe needs of different kinds of participants. Improved trading\r\ninfrastructure and further development of advanced features such as\r\nforward market instruments and reference contracts are needed to\r\nsupport increased liquidity, transparency and risk management,\r\nwhich can contribute to greater scale and efficiency.\"\n\n\n**Taking the Temperature: JPMorgan's report highlights\r\nthe potential value to companies of integrating high-quality carbon\r\ncredits into their overall sustainability plans, while also\r\nacknowledging the challenges in doing so. The integrity of carbon\r\ncredits is an ongoing source of controversy and challenge. Last\r\nyear, for instance, the Chair of the International Organization of\r\nSecurities Commissions [cited concerns](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=58&nid=11&search=carbon%20market) around the\r\n\"appropriate levels of integrity, transparency, and\r\nliquidity\" of voluntary markets.**\n\n\n**Of note, the integrity of credits traded on voluntary\r\ncarbon markets is not outside of federal regulatory oversight.\r\nEarlier this year, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading\r\nCommission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, [announced a speech](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=127&nid=28&search=carbon%20market) that the\r\nCFTC recognizes environmental products as \"commodities\"\r\nand therefore \"can play a role in voluntary [carbon] markets,\r\nand that carbon markets must be transparent and have integrity and\r\nadhere to basic market regulatory requirements.\" The CFTC\r\nChair's statement [followed a letter](/redirection.asp?article_id=1347028&company_id=1685&redirectaddress=https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=15&nid=3&search=carbon%20market) to the CFTC\r\nsent in the fall of 2022 by a group of Democratic senators asking\r\nfor improved regulation of the market for carbon offsets. It\r\nremains unclear how the CFTC would exercise this authority in\r\npractice and what the implications are for the developments of\r\nvoluntary markets; however, the CFTC has identified as a top\r\npriority addressing financial risks posed by climate change as well\r\nas prosecuting fraud and manipulation in carbon and environmental\r\nmarkets. In June of 2023, the CFTC published guidance for\r\nwhistleblowers to report fraud in spot and forward carbon markets,\r\nand then announced the creation of an environmental fraud\r\nenforcement task force.

JPMorgan also cautioned that voluntary markets\r\nare \"not a substitute for robust public policies designed to\r\naddress climate change.\"\n\n\nUnder JPMorgan's analysis, carbon markets provide benefits\r\nto the global effort to reduce carbon emissions beyond those\r\noffered by regulatory programs for three major reasons. First, they\r\nallow companies in industries that face challenges in reducing\r\ntheir carbon emissions where, for instance, \"the technologies\r\nnecessary to address emissions may not yet be commercially\r\navailable or else may still be prohibitively expensive,\" to\r\noffset their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits,\r\nthereby \"enabling greater deployment of climate solutions\r\nelsewhere in the economy.\" Second, by incentivizing\r\ninvestment, carbon markets \"facilitate more rapid deployment\r\nof proven solutions, which can drive down net emissions more\r\nquickly.\" Third, investing in projects via carbon credits can\r\npromote other environmentally friendly actions, including\r\nreforestation efforts, or a slowing of deforestation, which\r\nincreases biodiversity, reduces other forms of pollution, and\r\npromotes stronger environmental resilience.\n\n\nStill, JPMorgan recognized that carbon markets and the use of\r\ncarbon credits may not be adopted on a global scale and across all\r\nindustries as quickly as necessary to maintain net-zero targets\r\nwithout other efforts. Accordingly, it advises that companies\r\nshould still devise business strategies and invest in technologies\r\nthat will directly reduce their carbon emissions. While these\r\nactions may impose significant short-term capital expenses, they\r\nwill likely increase business efficiency and reduce long-term\r\ncosts, according to the bank. JPMorgan also cautioned that\r\nvoluntary markets are \"not a substitute for robust public\r\npolicies designed to address climate change.\"\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon markets provide for trading two main forms\r\nof credits: (a) avoidance credits and (b) removal credits.\r\nAvoidance credits are created when a company takes an action that\r\neither fully prevents or reduces the amount of carbon it normally\r\nwould have produced under business operations. For example,\r\ncompanies can generate these types of credits by transitioning to\r\nsolar energy or by taking actions to reduce deforestation. Removal\r\ncredits, on the other hand, are created when a company actively\r\npromotes removal of GHGs from the atmosphere. This can be\r\naccomplished through a variety of options, including nature-based\r\nsolutions like reforestation, or through technological developments\r\nlike investments in, or promoting the use of, carbon-capture\r\ntechnology. JPMorgan noted that while nature-based solutions like\r\nreforestation tend to be more readily accessible and cheaper, they\r\nonly store carbon for short periods of time. Technology like\r\ncarbon-capture provides long-term removal of GHGs from the\r\natmosphere, but tends to be expensive and is not yet fully\r\ndeveloped.\n\n\nAvoidance credits and removal credits work in tandem to\r\ncomplement each other. In the near-term, avoidance credits reduce\r\nthe amount of GHGs released and slow the accumulation of carbon in\r\nthe atmosphere. In the long-term, deployment of more expensive\r\ncarbon-capture technology has the potential to partially reverse\r\nhistoric GHG emissions and counteract the continued release of GHGs\r\nfrom industries where emissions-reduction is prohibitively\r\nexpensive or technologically difficult. As JPMorgan observed, while\r\nthe goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 will largely be accomplished\r\nthrough reducing carbon emissions, \"the large-scale removal of\r\nGHGs from the atmosphere will be [also] be necessary[.]\"\n\n\nJPMorgan also identified eight major factors it utilizes when\r\nassessing the value and utility of carbon credits, given widely\r\nrecognized issues associated with \"variation in the\r\navailability and quality of information needed to assess credit\r\nquality, resulting in a lack of confidence for many market\r\nparticipants.\" Under its framework, the GHG emission\r\nreductions underlying each carbon credit should be: (1) real and\r\nproven to have actually taken place; (2) measurable and\r\nquantifiable according to recognized methodological approaches; (3)\r\nin addition to what would have already been undertaken by the\r\ncompany; (4) unique and traceable to each initiative; (5)\r\nindependently verified by a reputable GHG accreditation program;\r\n(6) not simply a displacement of carbon emissions from one sector\r\nof the economy to another; (7) durable and long-term; and (8)\r\nequitable by promoting and supporting marginalized communities.\n\n\nJPMorgan highlighted additional challenges facing the\r\ndevelopment of effective and efficient voluntary carbon markets.\r\nThese include, in addition to a lack of quality information about\r\neach carbon credit, a scarcity of high-quality carbon credits that\r\nwould promote and support large-scale efforts at decarbonization;\r\nthe existence of \"multiple marketplaces, competing frameworks\r\nand principles;\" and an inability to \"support more\r\nsophisticated forms of trading, which limits its ability to meet\r\nthe needs of different kinds of participants. Improved trading\r\ninfrastructure and further development of advanced features such as\r\nforward market instruments and reference contracts are needed to\r\nsupport increased liquidity, transparency and risk management,\r\nwhich can contribute to greater scale and efficiency.\"\n\n\n**Taking the Temperature: JPMorgan's report highlights\r\nthe potential value to companies of integrating high-quality carbon\r\ncredits into their overall sustainability plans, while also\r\nacknowledging the challenges in doing so.

The Commission, however, must follow the laws applicable to this case, as well as the findings of fact supported by the evidence in the record. This is what we have done herein.\u201d\n\n\nVirginia is close to finalizing its withdrawal from RGGI following [Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s approval](https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkin-administration-completes-review-of-new-regs-to-pull-virginia-out-of-carbon-market-by-years-end/) of a regulation repealing the state\u2019s participation in the market. The regulation is set to be published in the Virginia Register July 31.\n\n\n\n> [Youngkin completes review of new regs to pull Virginia out of carbon market by year\u2019s end](https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkin-administration-completes-review-of-new-regs-to-pull-virginia-out-of-carbon-market-by-years-end/)\n> \n> \n\n\n\nFollowing a 30-day public comment period, the regulation, which calls for the withdrawal to happen at the end of the year, will be effective within 30 days. But a legal challenge is expected from critics of Youngkin\u2019s move, who say legislative action is needed for Virginia to pull out of the multistate network.\u00a0\n\n\nRGGI, which Virginia joined at the beginning of 2021 following Democratic-backed legislation, requires electricity producers to buy allowances for the carbon they emit at quarterly auctions. The revenues from the purchases are then returned to states; in Virginia they are directed toward [flood resilience](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/30/flood-fund-future-uncertain-as-youngkin-pushes-for-carbon-market-withdrawal/) and [energy efficiency](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/26/as-virginia-moves-to-pull-out-of-carbon-market-housing-groups-worry-about-funding-loss/) programs.\u00a0\n\n\nState law allows utilities to recover the costs of allowance purchases from their ratepayers.\u00a0\n\n\nDominion initially recouped its costs through a bill rider that cost the average residential customer $2.39 per month. [But in May 2022, Dominion asked regulators to suspend](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/06/dominion-asks-to-halt-ratepayer-charge-for-carbon-market/) the rider due to Youngkin\u2019s desire to withdraw from the market. The charge was halted July 31, 2022.\n\n\nThis December, the utility asked to restore the rider to cover costs it has incurred since July 31 and those it projects to spend on allowances until the end of the year, when Virginia is on track to leave RGGI. The amount Dominion asked to recover through Aug. 31, 2024 is $373 million, which would have equaled a $4.64 monthly fee on the average residential bill.\u00a0\n\n\nBut although the SCC approved the reinstatement of the fee, regulators reduced the amount Dominion sought to about $356 million because the utility\u2019s estimates of allowances it would need to purchase were higher than what past data suggests.\n\n\nDominion had previously pushed back against any reduction in its request by saying over-, or under-, projections of future costs are standard parts of any rider proceedings, and that a later true-up proceeding could provide refunds for any overcharges.\n\n\nThe commission rejected that argument, saying \u201cthe specific costs excluded by these adjustments are not simply over-projections. Rather, all participants \u2014 including Dominion \u2014 agree that these specific costs were included in error; that is, these costs admittedly do not fall within the Company\u2019s RGGI compliance obligations.\u201d\n\n\nApproval of the fee also received [pushback from environmental nonprofit Appalachian Voices](https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7s2d01!.PDF), which said allowance cost estimates should be based on projections of when the regional electric grid determines a fossil fuel unit owned by the utility can run at a cheaper cost rather than when Dominion itself decides to use the unit, a situation called must-run generation.\u00a0\n\n\nGregory Abbott, a former SCC staff member who argued on behalf of Appalachian Voices, said must-run generation could drive up allowance costs, increasing the amount of money the utility can recover from customers,\u00a0\n\n\nBut the commission rejected that argument, finding Dominion\u2019s decisions to operate its units are reasonable and prudent.\n\n\n\u201cThe allowance costs related to those must-run decisions are necessary to comply with the Company\u2019s statutory duty to purchase allowances for every short ton of CO2 emitted from those power plants,\u201d the judges wrote.\n\n\n[SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n\n\n\nDONATE](/donate)\n"}, {"source": "openPR.com", "title": "Carbon Offset/Carbon Credit Market by Type, Project Type, End-User and Regional Competitive Landscape", "link": "https://www.openpr.com/news/3146619/carbon-offset-carbon-credit-market-by-type-project-type", "summary": "- The user does not have permission to access the resource\n- The resource is located on the Apache server at www.openpr.com Port 443", "classification": {"category": "CategoryO1", "reason": "The article is not related to carbon"}, "sentiment": {"score": 1, "reason": "The article does not provide any sentiment as it only states that access is forbidden"}, "content": "\nForbidden\n=========\n\n\nYou don't have permission to access this resource.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nApache Server at www.openpr.com Port 443\n"}], [{"source": "The Indian Express", "title": "On carbon burden, Europe\u2019s glaring hypocrisy", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/on-carbon-burden-europes-glaring-hypocrisy-8862076/", "summary": "- The European Union (EU) is implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to combat climate change and carbon leakage.\n- The CBAM will impact trade with countries like India, which rely on the EU for exports of products potentially covered by CBAM.\n- Indian companies, like Tata Steel, are already preparing for the impact of CBAM and transitioning to greener practices.\n- There are concerns about the costs imposed on consumers and the concentration of market structures due to CBAM.\n- It is possible that the EU may incur higher input costs and may apply CBAM to keep countries like China out of the EU.\n- India could contest CBAM as discriminatory at the World Trade Organization (WTO), but should also focus on structuring the manufacturing sector and implementing effective taxing mechanisms to remain competitive.\n- India should ensure that its carbon pricing aligns with its development priorities in response to the EU's CBAM.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryN1", "reason": "The article discusses the European Union's carbon border adjustment mechanism and its impact on trade with countries like India."}, "sentiment": {"score": 3, "reason": "The article discusses the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism, which aims to combat climate change and carbon leakage. While it acknowledges the positive intention of reducing carbon emissions, it also raises concerns about the impact on trade and the concentration of market structures."}, "content": "The European Union\u2019s (EU) recent announcement of a gradual implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is viewed as a resurgence of frictions in an inherently unequal trading system. The CBAM is not separate from the EU\u2019s attempts at mitigating the effects of climate change that include an emission trading system used to price emissions. In the early phases, plenty of exemptions in the trading system undermined its efficacy. As the EU ramps up its efforts to withdraw free allowances in the system, there is a worry that businesses will relocate to jurisdictions with no such comparable regulations. Carbon leakage has compelled the EU to supplement its \u201cFit for 55 Agenda\u201d with a levy on imports from countries that do not price carbon. Developing countries are taking notice of this development as it kicks in this October.\n\n\nThe EU is an important trading partner. Even though its regional trade is significant, the composition of trade in specific commodities and services is not EU dominated. For example, Turkey, Russia, South Korea, India and China are the top five sources of steel imports for the EU. Similarly, Russia and Mozambique account for 50 per cent of its aluminum imports. Both these products along with cement, fertiliser, electricity and hydrogen will be covered under the initial phase of the CBAM. The worry is this will significantly impact trade with countries such as India that depend on the EU for its exports \u2014 26.4 per cent of India\u2019s exports of products are potentially covered by CBAM.\n\n![](https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg)\nMany within the Indian corporate sector have been preparing for this. For example, Tata Steel operates in the EU market and has experience with transitioning to green steel. As per its annual report 2022-23, CBAM will encourage the company to transition faster and the experience will help with the transition in India. The report also mentions the potential carbon-related costs (not CBAM) at its TSE plant in the Netherlands would be borne by the society, either through higher steel prices or through public spending or subsidies. This raises more important concerns than the CBAM itself. Large firms are relatively prepared and the costs may be passed forward. If this is the case, then should the CBAM be a worry from a trade perspective? Or, is there a need to expand the vision to market structures that may become even more concentrated, and to consumers who would have to bear the costs imposed by the transition?\n\n\nIt is possible that the EU may end up losing on account of higher input costs as they may be passed on to consumers. Steel and aluminum are crucial not just for its major exports such as vehicles but also for green transition (aluminum). CBAM will apply to aluminum even as the EU lists it as a critical mineral and struggles to lift its production. It is hard to reconcile these with the application of a tariff on imports except for the reason that CBAM is designed to keep countries such as China \u2014 suppliers of minerals \u2014 out of the EU. A similar approach was adopted in the past to protect smelters.\n\n\nSo how should India respond to this tax? There is the WTO to contest the measure as discriminatory. However, CBAM raises more serious concerns on the structure of the manufacturing sector that will be dominated by companies and countries that are able to withstand the winds of change. The EU and the US have responded to the challenge by designing incentive schemes to attract investments and to remain competitive. India too may have to innovate. With limited fiscal space, an internal carbon market along with an effective taxing mechanism may not only nudge firms in that direction, but also can support consumers and smaller businesses. Such pricing mechanisms can also work as a tool to negotiate equivalence with the CBAM, as common but differentiated responsibility would mean that India can price carbon differently as per its level of development.\n\nAlso Read[![GST gaming](https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/07/Opinion-card4_26th-Jult.jpg?resize=450,250)](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/tax-on-online-gaming-online-gambling-gst-public-gambling-act-8860106/)[Arvind Datar writes: With high GST on online games, death by taxes](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/tax-on-online-gaming-online-gambling-gst-public-gambling-act-8860106/)[![womans eye view](https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/07/Opinion-card5_26th-Jult.jpg?resize=450,250)](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/manipur-women-conditions-manipur-violence-democratic-india-manipur-male-viewpoint-8860114/)[Mrinal Pande writes on Manipur video, UCC: A woman\u2019s eye view](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/manipur-women-conditions-manipur-violence-democratic-india-manipur-male-viewpoint-8860114/)[![India forests](https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/07/Forest-Cut.jpg?resize=450,250)](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ravi-chellam-writes-why-protecting-indias-forests-should-be-a-part-of-national-security-8857475/)[Ravi Chellam writes: Why protecting India\u2019s forests should be a part of n...](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ravi-chellam-writes-why-protecting-indias-forests-should-be-a-part-of-national-security-8857475/)[![1998 nuclear test, Shakti tests, National Command Authority, South Asia, Indian conventional military thrust, US NATO Cold War, Warsaw Pact, US NATO nuclear strategy, indian express, indian express news](https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/07/Opinion-card3_24th-July.jpg?resize=450,250)](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/south-asia-nuclear-zero-8856389/)[Arun Prakash writes: Why India-Pakistan needs a nuclear dialogue \u2014 whatev...](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/south-asia-nuclear-zero-8856389/)\nThe EU\u2019s hypocrisy is hard to miss.

These will make EU richer by $500-800 billion annually through the sale of emission allowances, collection of fines, etc., once the regulations are implemented in full.\n\nThe EU needs money to continue to provide substantial subsidies to its firms and farmers. For instance, the European Green Deal alone aims to raise \u20ac1 trillion in the next 10 years, with \u20ac503 billion coming from the EU budget. The new regulations can provide full share of the EU budget. Table 1 shows some of the EU subsidy programmes.\n\n![](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/macro-economy/z7s004/article65944872.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_320/filler784)EU\u2019s hypocrisy knows no limits as it distributes billions of dollars of subsidies to its farmers and industry, while empowering itself to investigate subsidies given by other countries.\n\nLet us now discuss the EU\u2019s five new regulations and their impact on business and trade. Table 2 captures the core details of each regulation.\n\n![](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/macro-economy/z7s004/article65944872.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_320/filler784)**One, the Deforestation**\u00a0Regulation (EUDR) will shake up trade in agricultural goods. The regulation requires firms to ensure that the product exported to the EU has been grown on land which has not been deforested after December 31, 2020. The new rules will apply to large firms w.e.f. December 2024 and small firms in June 2025.\n\nThe regulation will initially affect trade of meat, oil cake, soya beans, palm oil, coffee, leather hide, skin, paper, paperboard, and wood furniture. The EU will expand the product list soon. Foreign exporters would be required to invest in expensive due diligence and share farm level data with the EU. The EU provides significant subsidies to its farmers, the EUDR will make imports costly and thus will help EU firms. It is not WTO compatible and a non-tariff barrier.\n\n**Two, Carbon Border**\u00a0Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). This will allow the EU to charge a tax on the import of steel, aluminium, cement, fertiliser, hydrogen, and electricity from January 1, 2026. By 2023 CBAM will tax all industrial products. The process will start from October 1 this year, when Indian exporters must share firm-level emission data with the EU. The UK, Canada, Japan, and the US are also bracing to levy similar import taxes.\n\nDeveloped countries account for about 60 per cent of global imports and have an average industrial tariff of 2-3 per cent. CBAM will translate into a 20-35 per cent carbon tax over and above import duties. Imagine the disruption in trade in industrial goods with import taxes going up 10 times. CBAM will divide the world into two parts: CBAM-charging countries and the rest of the world. This will disrupt the existing global supply chains and increase trade costs.\n\n**Three, inclusion**\u00a0of shipping in the EU\u2019s Emissions Trading System (ETS). The EU parliament included shipping in the ETS on April 18, 2023. As a result, EU will start charging a CBAM-like tax from EU\u2019s outbound and inbound shipping companies from January 1, 2027. The EU ETS will initially cover large ships of 5,000 gross tonnes and above but will later cover smaller ships. The compliances will generate revenue for the EU but result in 3-4 per cent increase in the price of export and import products.\n\nTo reduce emissions, ships need to switch from using bunker fuel to low-carbon fuels like LNG and ammonia. The shipping sector must also invest in optimising hull design, using efficient engines, etc. The International Energy Agency estimates a $1.5 trillion expenditure to achieve net-zero emissions from global shipping by 2050. India\u2019s shipping sector must set aside over $100 billion to survive in a low-carbon future.\n\n**Four, the EUs\u2019**\u00a0Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR). This prohibits foreign subsidies and grants the EU the authority to investigate cases where foreign subsidies distort competition within the EU. The FSR covers financial contributions from non-EU governments to firms operating in/exporting to the EU. The EU Commission is investigating the PLI scheme, and a decision is expected soon.\n\nFirms must notify M&A and public procurement transactions to EU authorities above a certain value. For M&A, the FSR kicks in if the value of the merging companies\u2019 assets exceeds \u20ac500 million or if the value of foreign subsidies exceeds \u20ac1 million. For public procurement-related transactions, the threshold values are \u20ac250 million or if value of foreign subsidies exceeds \u20ac4 million.\n\n**Five, German**\u00a0Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCDDA). It prohibits forced labour and other labour law violations by German and foreign firms doing business with Germany with supply chains extending within and outside Germany. The law applies to firms with more than 3,000 employees. The firms must implement new due diligence processes and extensive compliance measures, resulting in higher costs. However, the law could also could help workers from being exploited. In India, it is crucial to raise awareness of labour laws among workers and employers and establish efficient complaint-handling mechanisms.\n\nThe law may result in few surprises for Germany. Germany may give up sourcing cobalt, a key component for batteries, from Congo mines, where human rights issues, including child and forced labour, are prevalent. Germany may have to halt the import of industrial goods from China due to concerns regarding the treatment of Uyghurs.\n\nThough the European Union (EU) does not have the economic or military clout of the US or China, it always was miles ahead than the rest on introducing new regulations. Tough days are ahead for global trade and climate talks. EU has become the first one to dump both the WTO and UNFCC and began taking unilateral measures.\n\nThe writer is founder, Global Trade Research Initiative, a research group focused on technology, climate and trade\n\n![comment](https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/1x1_spacer.png)\nComments\n\n\nSHARE\n* Copy link\n* [Email](mailto:?subject=EU%E2%80%99s%20green%20rules%20will%20derail%20trade&amp;body=Check%20out%20this%20link%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindubusinessline.com%2Fopinion%2Feus-green-rules-will-derail-trade%2Farticle67124543.ece)\n* Facebook\n* Twitter\n* Telegram\n* LinkedIn\n* WhatsApp\n* Reddit\nPublished on July 26, 2023 ![comment](https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/1x1_spacer.png) COMMENT NOW \n\u00a0\u00a01.
