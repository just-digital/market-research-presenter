According to the latest United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/), achieving that goal will require both large-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and removal of GHGs from the atmosphere.\n\nAt present, the most efficient and scalable GHG-removal strategy is the massive planting of trees through reforestation or afforestation - a \"natural climate solution\" (NCS) that extracts atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and soil carbon sequestration.\n\nDespite the potential of forestry-based NCS projects to address climate change, biodiversity loss, unemployment, and other societal needs - and their appeal to policymakers, funders, and citizens - they have yet to achieve critical mass, and often underperform due to a mix of interacting ecological, social, and financial constraints. To better understand these challenges and identify opportunities to overcome them, a team of researchers at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and the [MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](https://globalchange.mit.edu/) recently studied how environmental scientists, local stakeholders, and project funders perceive the risks and benefits of NCS projects, and how these perceptions impact project goals and performance. To that end, they surveyed and consulted with dozens of recognized experts and organizations spanning the fields of ecology, finance, climate policy, and social science.\n\nThe team's [analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2023.1216175/full), which appears in the journal Frontiers in Climate, found two main factors that have hindered the success of forestry-based NCS projects.\n\nFirst, the ambition - levels of carbon removal, ecosystem restoration, job creation, and other environmental and social targets - of selected NCS projects is limited by funders' perceptions of their overall risk. Among other things, funders aim to minimize operational risk (e.g., Will newly planted trees survive and grow?), political risk (e.g., Just how secure is their access to the land where trees will be planted?); and reputational risk (e.g., Will the project be perceived as an exercise in \"greenwashing,\" or fall way short of its promised environmental and social benefits?). Funders seeking a financial return on their initial investment are also concerned about the dependability of complex monitoring, reporting, and verification methods used to quantify atmospheric carbon removal, biodiversity gains, and other metrics of project performance.\n\nSecond, the environmental and social benefits of NCS projects are unlikely to be realized unless the local communities impacted by these projects are granted ownership over their implementation and outcomes. But while engaging with local communities is critical to project performance, it can be challenging both legally and financially to set up incentives (e.g., payment and other forms of compensation) to mobilize such engagement.\n\n\"Many carbon offset projects raise legitimate concerns about their effectiveness,\" says study lead author [Bonnie Waring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.waring), a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London. \"However, if nature climate solution projects are done properly, they can help with sustainable development and empower local communities.\"\n\nDrawing on surveys and consultations with NCS experts, stakeholders, and funders, the research team highlighted several recommendations on how to overcome key challenges faced by forestry-based NCS projects and boost their environmental and social performance.\n\nThese recommendations include encouraging funders to evaluate projects based on robust internal governance, support from regional and national governments, secure land tenure, material benefits for local communities, and full participation of community members from across a spectrum of socioeconomic groups; improving the credibility and verifiability of project emissions reductions and related co-benefits; and maintaining an open dialogue and shared costs and benefits among those who fund, implement, and benefit from these projects.\n\n\"Addressing climate change requires approaches that include emissions mitigation from economic activities paired with greenhouse gas reductions by natural ecosystems,\" says [Sergey Paltsev](https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey), a co-author of the study and deputy director of the MIT Joint Program. \"Guided by these recommendations, we advocate for a proper scaling-up of NCS activities from project levels to help assure integrity of emissions reductions across entire countries.\"\n\n"}, {"source": "Phys.org", "title": "New way of measuring ocean carbon could better align with climate policy goals", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-07-ocean-carbon-align-climate-policy.html", "summary": "- Browser sent an invalid request\n- Received 400 Bad Request response", "classification": {"category": "CategoryO1", "reason": "The article is not related to carbon."}, "sentiment": {"score": 1, "reason": "The article is not related to carbon removal or emission prevention."}, "content": "400 Bad request\n===============\n\n\nYour browser sent an invalid request.\n"}], [{"source": "Phys.org", "title": "Voluntary carbon offsets often fail to deliver what they promise, research finds", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-07-voluntary-carbon-offsets.html", "summary": "- Invalid request sent by browser", "classification": {"category": "CategoryO1", "reason": "The article is not related to carbon"}, "sentiment": {"score": 1, "reason": "Invalid request;

ISO's \"IWA 42:2022\" document (linked above) provides \"guiding principles and recommendations to enable a common approach with a high level of ambition...\" but does not recommend specific actions.\n\nISO issued a new guidance document, ISO PAS 50010: 2023 in January, which provides concrete recommendations for how an organization can set and meet net zero energy and emissions goals that increase in effectiveness every year. \u201cIt distinguishes between several different scopes and boundaries for\u2026 different net zero goals and their targets, which are increasingly effective at reducing energy and GHG emissions, and correspondingly more difficult to achieve.\u201d\u00a0It recommends that the organization develop a multi-year plan to progress from more modest net zero goals to more ambitious ones in further years, resulting in ever-decreasing GHG emissions.\n\nMy colleague Ju-Myon Park of Korea and I discussed the [content of ISO 50010, the reasoning behind it, and its implications](https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/ssi23/3-106-GOLDSTEIN.pdf) in a paper presented on July 12, 2023, at the ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry. The paper and its presentation described the development and content of IOS PAS 50010, and this blog offers a summary.\n\nOne key goal of ISO 50010 is harmonizing definitions of key concepts such as net zero, what counts as renewable energy, and how to calculate GHG emissions, so that we can set targets that are mutually reinforcing, rather than engaging in arguments between countries or corporations about whose definitions and rules are better. The ISO standard development process noted that while there are several existing standards on how to describe the issue, they all had more in common than they had differences.\n\n**Net Zero is a more credible goal than carbon neutral**\n\nThe existing Internet articles we examined differ in how they distinguish carbon neutral from net zero, but all of them agreed that net zero was a more credible goal. [The World Economic Forum stated that net zero was \u201cthe gold standard.\u201d](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/carbon-neutral-net-zero-sustainability-climate-change/) In part, this was because there was no recognized standard for carbon neutrality and because companies claiming carbon neutrality often depended on buying carbon offsets rather than directly reducing the emissions from their operations, or directly installing clean renewable energy. Offsets can often be of questionable validity, with several critiques of named companies arguing that the offsets used by Company X did not result in real or substantial carbon savings.\n\nAnother difference cited by World Economic Forum and several other websites was the greater scope of net zero, which was stated to include all GHGs, not just carbon from energy production, and to include upstream elements of the supply chain (so-called [Scope 3](https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance) emissions), neither of which is always the case. ISO 50010 includes specified parts of Scope 3 emissions for the more advanced level of net zero, but the lower levels are limited to Scope 1 or Scope 2.\n\nThe key difference noted in ISO 50010 and highlighted in the ACEEE paper is the preference order for GHG reduction actions. ISO 50010 recommends:\n\n* First, develop and implement Energy Performance Improvement Actions such as increased energy efficiency. This suggestion is placed first because such actions usually have lower cost and ancillary benefits beyond energy and emissions savings.\n* Then, transfer the remaining energy consumption to less carbon-intensive or clean renewable energy.\n* Then, change the timing of energy consumption to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nThe standard discourages the use of offsets, suggesting that the user consider disallowing them outright, and encourages on-site renewables over off-site, and either over financial clean energy acquisition, such as Renewable Energy Credits.\n\nThe preference is thus for measurable physical or software actions that can unambiguously be attributed to a single facility or organization, and checked by third parties, over untraceable financial deals.\n\nISO 50010 also reconciles the differences between a number of national and nonprofit-authored standards for net zero by focusing on different choices of scopes and boundaries of what is being zeroed out, and ranking them in terms of the extent of environmental benefit. The standard then encourages an organization to start with the easiest level of scope and boundaries and proceed in a planned manner\u2014with target dates\u2014to the higher levels.\n\nThe \u00a0levels recommended in the standard, in order from weakest to strongest, are:\n\n1. Net zero energy. This level is easiest because, for most organizations, the use of electricity is largest when the electric grid is at its most emissive (right after the sun goes down and solar resources do not produce) and at its least when the sun is shining brightly and solar electricity is displacing almost all polluting generators.\n2. Net zero carbon, where emissions are calculated for each hour of the day and month of the year so that energy use produces no net emissions from the utility system. [Accounting for time of use makes emissions calculations more accurate, and often makes a big difference.](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/david-b-goldstein/new-tool-measuring-decarbonization)\n3. Net zero carbon including the carbon used to construct the facility, and where relevant the carbon emissions from generating the supplies or parts used by the facility (such as the food supply to a restaurant or the steel for an automobile factory).\n4. Achieving level 3 plus zeroing out the emissions from transporting people and goods to and from the site (so that an efficient building with solar but \u00a0located miles from transit and from jobs and services has more carbon to make up for than the same building in a compact, walkable, transit-rich neighborhood).\n5. Meeting level 4 plus zeroing out downstream usage and disposal. Thus an air conditioner manufacturer would have to account for the emissions produced by the electricity used to run the units and the leakage of refrigerant gases (which are potent GHGs).\n\nThis structure improves the credibility of the claims and allows the users to choose the levels that are most appropriate for their economic role and responsibilities, and focuses them on doing the most beneficial things first. For example, if a plant or a building improves its efficiency, then it needs to spend less on renewables, or, better still, can use the same renewable projects to offset even more emissions and thus achieve zero emissions over a broader scope of activities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIf we do not set clear and mutually consistent targets aligned with climate science, we won\u2019t know how to hit the targets and will fall short. ISO 50010 establishes explicit targets and operating methods to achieve them, and thus can assist organizations to set the best goals and then meet them.\u00a0\n\n\n"}, {"source": "Reuters", "title": "US Treasury names green energy research executive as new climate counselor", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-treasury-names-green-energy-research-executive-new-climate-counselor-2023-07-27/", "summary": "- Ethan Zindler named new climate counselor for the U.S. Treasury\n- Zindler replaces John Morton, who stepped down in December\n- Zindler most recently served as head of the Americas division at BloombergNEF\n- Zindler will advise Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on implementing the Inflation Reduction Act and assisting other countries in meeting climate goals.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryS1", "reason": "The article names Ethan Zindler as the new climate counselor for the U.S. Treasury, responsible for unlocking financing to achieve a net-zero carbon emissions economy."}, "sentiment": {"score": 5, "reason": "The article highlights the appointment of a new climate counselor for the U.S. Treasury who will lead efforts to achieve a net-zero carbon emissions economy, indicating a strong commitment to combat climate change."}, "content": "[Skip to main content](#main-content)[Exclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionalsLearn more aboutRefinitiv](/differentiator/)[Reuters home](/)* [World](/world/)\n* [Business](/business/)\n* [Markets](/markets/)\n* [Sustainability](/sustainability/)\n* [Legal](/legal/)\n* [Breakingviews](/breakingviews/)\n* [Technology](/technology/)\n* [Investigations](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/)\n* More\nMy View[Register](/account/register/sign-up/&journeyStart=navigation)* [United States](/world/us/)\nUS Treasury names green energy research executive as new climate counselor\n==========================================================================\n\nBy [David Lawder](/authors/david-lawder/)July 27, 20234:55 PM UTCUpdated ago* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \nWASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Thursday said Ethan Zindler, a climate and clean energy research executive, has been named the department's new climate counselor, charged with leading its efforts to unlock financing to achieve a net-zero carbon emissions economy.\n\nZindler replaces John Morton, who [stepped down in December](/world/us/us-treasurys-morton-steps-down-sees-growing-recognition-climate-change-risks-2022-12-16/) from running Treasury's \"climate hub\" to return to the private climate finance sector.

They also agreed speeding up the process for gaining federal approval for large infrastructure and energy projects would be helpful.\n\n\nDemocrats voiced support for taking steps to reduce carbon emissions, while Republicans mostly ignored that issue or said it would be a waste. Among those testifying was Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, who said his state is particularly vulnerable to climate change and contributes more carbon emissions than most states.\n\n\nU.S. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sheldon Whitehouse cited several examples from across the country of extreme weather damaging infrastructure.\n\n\nExcessive heat has led to roads buckling in Oregon, Texas and Utah, he said. Utilities have preemptively shut off power lines to avoid wildfires in the West. Drought in the Midwest brought water levels so low that river barges got stuck.\n\n\nThose examples and others hurt economic activity, Whitehouse said.\n\n\nThe Rhode Island Democrat advocated for a two-track approach to build more resilient power lines, bridges, sewer systems, levees and other infrastructure, and to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\n\n\u201cRepeatedly, this committee has heard expert testimony about the massive economic and fiscal costs of dawdling,\u201d he said. \u201cThose dangers are clear and present. I hope that the message is getting through: This is real.\u201d\n\n\nWhitehouse praised state-level efforts in Louisiana for its coastal resiliency planning and Iowa for promoting wind power. Nearly two-thirds of Iowa\u2019s energy production now comes from wind, Whitehouse said.\n\n\n#### Republicans question priorities\n\n\nThe ranking Republican on the panel, Iowa\u2019s Chuck Grassley, said he was supportive of climate change policies \u2014 including the wind power tax credit he championed that was helpful to his state\u2019s wide-scale adoption of wind energy \u2014 but that the committee was overly focused on the issue.\n\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing was one in a series held by Whitehouse, known as one of the Senate\u2019s most aggressive climate hawks, while the core mission of the Budget Committee has gone unaddressed, Grassley said.\n\n\n\u201cOur nation is over $32 trillion in debt, yet this committee is holding the 11th hearing on climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cOur spending is out of control and Democrats haven\u2019t written a budget in the past two years.\u201d\n\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, characterized attempts to limit carbon emissions as useless.\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the law Democrats [passed last year](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-passes-major-health-tax-and-climate-bill-boost-democrats) that includes hundreds of billions for renewable energy tax credits and other climate priorities \u2014 could cost the federal government $1.2 trillion, according to some estimates, Johnson said.\n\n\n\u201cI have no idea where that money\u2019s going to be spent,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be spent trying to mitigate climate change, I would argue it\u2019s probably going to be misspent because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we can really do to hold back the tides.\u201d\n\n\nThe government should instead spend a fraction of that money to make sure the electric grid is reliable and resilient, even in the face of natural disasters, Johnson said.\n\n\n#### \u2018Both fronts\u2019\n\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Edwards told senators he has prioritized both limiting emissions and preparing infrastructure for extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, that are linked to climate change.\n\n\nAsked by Johnson if it wouldn\u2019t be more effective to focus on infrastructure resilience rather than limiting carbon emissions, Edwards said he had a difference of opinion with Johnson.\n\n\n\u201cI think we need to be acting on both fronts,\u201d he said.\n\n\nJohnson implied that a U.S. transition away from fossil fuels would not affect the carbon emissions of rapidly developing countries like China and India. Limiting fossil fuel production ignores the current economic reality, he said.\n\n\nBut Edwards said looking to renewable energy sources would be a wise long-term strategy.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an enemy of fossil fuels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been a fossil fuel state for over 100 years. But it\u2019s clear to me if we\u2019re going to be an energy state in the next 50 years, we\u2019re going to embrace the transition. We will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, increase our reliance on clean energy such as wind.\u201d\n\n\n#### Hopes remain for permitting overhaul\n\n\nThe [debt limit deal](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default) that Congress [passed this year](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-biden-debt-limit-legislation-ahead-monday-default-deadline) included some changes to how federal agencies grant environmental approvals for infrastructure and energy projects.\n\n\nBut those changes were insufficient to speed up projects that are hampered by administrative delays and legal challenges, according to Alex Herrgott, the leader of The Permitting Institute, a group that advocates for easier permitting requirements.\n\n\nTo see real change, lawmakers would have to alter bedrock environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, and the Clean Water Act, he said.\n\n\n\u201cIn practice, developers will still experience most of the same obstacles and avoidable process delays that have plagued the system for decades,\u201d Herrgott told the panel. \u201cTruly impactful legislation will have to move beyond macro-level NEPA changes and untangle the web of confusion and uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\nHerrgott, who led the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council under former President Donald Trump, said the issue was nonpartisan.\n\n\n\u201cThis is not a Republican or a Democrat issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a process issue we can fix.\u201d\n\n\nWhitehouse said he had \u201cnot given up hope on bipartisan permitting reform\u201d passing Congress this year.\n\n\nSeveral Democrats on the panel, including Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, said renewable energy projects and their associated transmission lines, as well as resilient infrastructure projects, were stymied by a lengthy permitting process.\n\n\n\u201cI think many Democrats want to do permitting reform,\u201d Kaine said.\n\n\nRepublicans on the panel also said they supported a permitting overhaul as part of a climate change agenda.\n\n\n\u201cJust like fossil fuel projects, renewable projects, face years of permitting delays,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t permitting reform be at the top list of anyone concerned about climate change?\u201d\n\n\n"}], [{"source": "Mirage News", "title": "Wiley's Net-Zero Goal Confirmed by SBTi", "link": "https://www.miragenews.com/wileys-net-zero-goal-confirmed-by-sbti-1055489/", "summary": "- Wiley commits to becoming carbon net-zero by 2040\n- The Science Based Targets initiative validates Wiley's climate target\n- Wiley aims to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by FY2030\n- Wiley commits to reducing scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and business travel by 50%\n- Goals align with the objectives of the Paris Agreement\n- Wiley demonstrates commitment to transparency, accountability, and leadership in sustainability", "classification": {"category": "CategoryD1", "reason": "The article mentions Wiley committing to becoming carbon net-zero and reducing their greenhouse gas emissions."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article's sentiment is positive as it highlights Wiley's commitment to becoming carbon net-zero and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."}, "content": "\nThe global leader in research, publishing and knowledge solutions commits to becoming carbon net-zero by 2040\n\nHOBOKEN, N.J. - The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated the climate target set by Wiley (NYSE: WLY) to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040.

The second pillar is our nature restoration and biodiversity legislation and strategy for 2030 \u2014 we see biodiversity loss and climate change as reinforcing each other. Even if we all reach zero emissions but ecosystems continue to degrade, with oceans unable to absorb carbon and forests not able to deliver their functionality,\" Sinkevicius said.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://img.etimg.com/photo/42031747.cms)ET Bureau[Virginijus Sinkevicius](/topic/virginijus-sinkevicius) is the [European Union](/topic/european-union) (EU) Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries. In India for the Environment and Climate Sustainability [G20](/topic/g20) Ministers Meeting, he spoke with Srijana Mitra Das about the EU\u2019s climate steps:  \n  \n**Q. Can you tell us about your visit?**A. India is an extremely important strategic partner for the EU. We\u2019ve been enjoying increasing bilateral relations which can bring global benefits as well.  \n  \nThe main aim of my visit is the G20 meeting but I will also meet business leaders, civil society representatives and India\u2019s ministers for earth sciences, fisheries, ports, shipping and waterways, etc. We hope to reconfirm our bilateral interest in key areas like the [circular economy](/topic/circular-economy) \u2014 that has great potential with India\u2019s growing consumption patterns as it moves towards becoming one of the world\u2019s leading economic powers.  \n  \nAlso, we have ahead of us the implementation of historic achievements including the Global Biodiversity Framework and the High Seas Treaty. These offer us the chance to develop clear language for COP28 as well where we must ensure we stay within the Paris Agreement. That isn\u2019t an easy task \u2014 I hope G20 can bring us closer to that.  \n  \n**Q. You focus on a sustainable blue economy \u2014 what are its aims?**A. Consider the variety of activities involved here. Earlier, we had fisheries, some shipping, etc. Today, alongside large increases in these, we also have underwater cables for data transfers, electricity, renewable energy, tourism, etc. Pressure on the seas will only increase. So, a focal point is strategic planning. Fisheries must also be sustainable with zero tolerance for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  \n  \n**Q. Is the EU encouraging a global ban on subsidies which promote overfishing?**A. Yes. The [WTO](/topic/wto) has moved in that direction \u2014 we\u2019d like them to go further because harmful subsidies in fisheries can then be listed as WTO cases. Such subsidies and sustainability cannot go hand in hand. The Global Biodiversity Framework, which includes 50% protection of marine areas globally, restoration, etc., can\u2019t be implemented alongside these.   \n  \nIt\u2019s an irony when you work very hard to get one dollar of international development money to make a positive difference but there are four dollars of harmful subsidies, taking you several steps back. It\u2019s very positive this is going to the WTO level now.  \n  \n![](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg)  \n**Q. What are the main pillars of the EU\u2019s [Green Deal](/topic/green-deal)?**A. The Green Deal should be seen as a global initiative and not only European. Climate change, pollution or biodiversity loss are global challenges. If the EU, parts of which are facing extreme weather now, reaches even zero emissions, the world would still be in peril because climate change requires a lowering of emissions from everyone. That\u2019s why it is crucially important to implement the Paris Agreement. In the Green Deal, the key pillar therefore is decarbonisation which is approached horizontally.   \n  \nI see this as an opportunity for achieving a completely different economy, with clean tech, renewable energy, non polluting transport, etc. EU region countries have an ambition, a concrete plan and legislation towards this. The second pillar is our nature restoration and biodiversity legislation and strategy for 2030 \u2014 we see biodiversity loss and climate change as reinforcing each other. Even if we all reach zero emissions but ecosystems continue to degrade, with oceans unable to absorb carbon and forests not able to deliver their functionality.  \n  \n Earth is in danger. IPCC calculations are done in a way where ecosystems are able to deliver \u2014 this is often forgotten. We also have a zero-pollution ambition with clean air and water for all.  \n  \nThe circular economy package is already a success \u2014 businesses accepted this as it brings new opportunities and jobs while lowering emissions by reducing the extraction of new resources. It\u2019s very important that this entire model be looked at horizontally. A minister of environment alone cannot be responsible for the implementation of a Green Deal \u2014 this needs convincing ministers of finance and others.  \n  \n**Q. What does the EU\u2019s CBAM or carbon tax entail \u2014 and does it take climate justice adequately on board?**A. When we all commit to decarbonisation, we cannot allow carbon leakage \u2014 if EU industry moves to other regions and continues to emit there, what is the point of the Green Deal? Therefore, we want to have a level global playing field. The Carbon Border Adjusted Mechanism (CBAM) has a long transition period when adopted.   \n  \nWe\u2019ll also be working closely with partner countries, ensuring they are equipped with the tools of compliance. But it cannot be the case that we all commit to the climate emergency, gather in Paris, Glasgow or the UAE, sign on this, then return home \u2014 and continue with our harmful subsidies, pollution and emissions.  \n  \nThere are differences between regions and levels of development. Hence, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) allow each country to go as far as ambition, budget, etc., permit. But competition in the Green Deal is good because the planet wins. I hope there will be even more environmentally ambitious regions which try to overtake the EU\u2019s vision. Climate is truly a global challenge. The EU cannot solve this alone.  \nDon\u2019t miss out on ET Prime stories!

There is an estimated financing gap to fill of between [$598-824\n*billion* per year by\n2030](https://www.paulsoninstitute.org/conservation/financing-nature-report/) to\naddress global biodiversity loss.\n\n\nBiodiversity credits are a mechanism that allows companies to support projects\nthat result in positive biodiversity outcomes, with a view to [funding the\nlong-term conservation and restoration of\nnature](/read/defining-the-next-economy/brands-embrace-exciting-climate-mitigation-tool).\nThey are tradeable units generated by a nature-based solutions project\nregistered under a biodiversity credit scheme. At this stage of the market\ndevelopment, there is broad alignment on the idea that biodiversity credits are\nnot intended to be used to offset an equivalent, negative impact on biodiversity\nelsewhere.\n\n\nWith that in mind, there are two reasons companies might choose to invest in\nbiodiversity credits:\n\n\n1. To fulfill a [voluntary corporate\ncommitment](/read/defining-the-next-economy/loreal-apple-cultivate-nature-based-climate-biodiversity-solutions)\nto contribute to a nature-positive future by 2030, by helping to finance the\nsystemic change required to address biodiversity loss; and\n2. To demonstrate positive action towards the mitigation of [nature-related\nrisks associated with biodiversity\nloss](/read/finance-investment/record-number-of-companies-recognize-biodiversity-risks-but-struggling-to-turn-commitments-into-action)\nto which companies are exposed, and which they will increasingly be expected\nto disclose under the TNFD framework from 2023.\n\n\nThe benefit of investing in biodiversity credits to demonstrate a company\u2019s\naction against these objectives is that the \u2018unitization\u2019 of biodiversity\noutcomes in the form of credits takes the guesswork out of designing the\ninvestment. Commonly accepted approaches track the key characteristics of\nbiodiversity \u2014 including richness, abundance of species, vulnerability of those\nspecies and ecosystems, functionality and integrity \u2014 which can be used to\ndefine biodiversity baselines and track changes over time; and define those\noutcomes in the form of tradeable \u2018units\u2019 in accordance with robust, scientific\nmethodologies.\n\n\n### Legal, regulatory and policy developments to be aware of\n\n\n**Nature Finance** and [**Pollination**](https://pollinationgroup.com/) recently [published a\npaper](https://www.naturefinance.net/resources-tools/biodiversity-credit-markets/)\non the role of law, regulation and policy in the biodiversity-credit markets\nthat outlined developments to be aware of in this space.

Putting a price on carbon emissions by developing a trading system (carbon market) to buy and sell carbon credits is one way to limit emissions. The Ministry of Power\u2019s (MoP) recent Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023 aims at creating a domestic market for tracking and trading carbon credits. The policy is a step in the right direction for setting up India's compliance and voluntary carbon markets. Still, several questions remain unanswered on whether it operationalises the market.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe concept of carbon credit is not new in India. The domestic carbon compliance market has existed for a long time in the form of Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) for tradable energy certificates (ESCerts) by designated consumers in industrial units from energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium, cement, chlor-alkali, fertiliser, iron & steel, paper & pulp, railways, thermal power and textile. The Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for renewable energy certificates (RECs) by generators producing electricity from clean sources like solar, wind, biomass, small hydro and municipal solid waste is another form of carbon compliance. Further, the Energy Conservation Act 2001 also discusses issuing carbon credit certificates to registered entities.\u00a0\n\n\nCCTS will now encompass the existing trading mechanism by transitioning from tonnes of oil equivalent (ESCerts) to carbon certificates expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. \u00a0\n\n\nThe CCTS notification lays the framework and structure of the domestic carbon market. It constitutes a National Steering Committee comprising representatives from key ministries to govern the domestic carbon market. This committee will give recommendations to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for establishing emissions targets and trajectories for obligated entities under the compliance mechanism and lay guidelines for issuing and trading carbon credit certificates outside India.\u00a0\n\n\nEssentially, BEE will become an administrator and develop procedures and eligibility criteria for accrediting carbon verification agencies. The Grid Controller of India will handle the meta registry for obligated and non-obligated entities under the compliance and voluntary carbon markets, respectively. Meanwhile, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will regulate the trading of certificates.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) provided a series of comments in response to the draft CCTS released by the MoP in March 2023. The MoP adopted some of the suggestions, including setting up a meta registry that will be compatible with international registries, the inclusion of the non-power sector, a pathway for setting targets for emission reduction and inclusion of PAT and REC. But, the notification falls short of clarifying the operationalisation aspects, including eligible consumers, price discovery, voluntary market mechanisms and linking the domestic carbon market with the international markets to attract finance and technology.\u00a0\n\n\n**Timeline for operationalising the market**\n\n\nThe notification does not provide a timeline for operationalising the carbon market, including which section of the market is likely to start first. It defines obligated entities as those notified under the compliance mechanism and non-obligated entities as those that can purchase carbon credit certificates voluntarily. This definition and stakeholder consultations held by the BEE suggest that obligated entities are those that the existing PAT scheme covers. The current cycle for PAT continues until 2025. It is unclear whether the CCTS mandates all or some of these entities to transfer to the carbon credit market. As such, it will be useful to understand the timeline. Some newspaper reports discuss starting the voluntary carbon market right away. This requires clarity on the sectors and a timeline for targets and processes.\u00a0\n\n\n**Limited specification on the sectors eligible to participate in the domestic carbon market**\n\n\nThe notification states that the MoP will notify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity targets to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), based on recommendations from BEE. Obligated entities will have to achieve these targets along with any other targets, such as non-fossil energy consumption or specific energy consumption, as per the MoP\u2019s notifications. But there is no clarity on the eligibility of the sectors and industries under this scheme. The eleven sectors identified by the National Carbon Market include petroleum refineries, cement, steel, chlor-alkali, aluminium, thermal power plants and fertilisers. Will the list expand to add more sectors? If yes, then the question is how will these additional sectors be identified. \u00a0\n\n\n**Aligning with the existing domestic market**\n\n\nThe Green Credit Programme (GCP) announced by MoEFCC aims to incentivise environmentally conscious practises via trading green credits. This will be a purely voluntary market covering eight sectors, primarily affecting rural areas. The sectors focus on increasing tree cover, promoting water conservation, adopting natural and regenerative agricultural practices, improving soil health and the nutritional value of food, managing waste effectively and reducing air pollution. \u00a0\n\n\nThese activities under GCP may generate green credits and carbon credits from the same activity under the carbon market. If this is so, how are the two different? What would be the potential use of green credits if they also generate carbon credits that could be sold in the domestic market? How will the two markets intersect or overlap?\u00a0\n\n\n**Linkages with international carbon markets**\n\n\nIndia has been participating in the sale of carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) route and private sector-driven voluntary carbon market. Between 2010 and 2022, India issued 278 million credits in the voluntary carbon market, accounting for 17 per cent of global supply, according to the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Special report by S&P Global Commodity Insights. With the domestic carbon market now in place, it is unclear whether the global carbon credit certificates will run parallel to the domestic ones. \u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, is there a need to regulate (if yes, how?) carbon credits exported for trade in the international voluntary carbon market? Such decisions will impact India\u2019s strategy to welcome foreign direct investment in decarbonisation activities.\u00a0\n\n\n**Getting the pricing right for carbon credits**\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the carbon market will depend on the accuracy of carbon price discovery. If the buying price is too high, it will deter participation, especially from micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). If the selling price is too low, there will be no incentive for real emissions reduction.\u00a0\n\n\nHence, a robust methodology for price discovery and some pilots will be necessary going forward. The methodology should clearly lay out the process for price discovery based on sectoral or unit-wise emission targets. It also needs structured checks and balances to ensure market stability and prevent an oversupply or overdemand of credits.\u00a0\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon market requires even greater efforts as price discovery is more complex considering the variety in project sizes, location, quality, value adds, and more. The scheme seems to focus on the compliance market, providing limited guidance for non-obligated entities. Enhancing private sector participation in the voluntary carbon market needs a more structured and incentive-driven mechanism.\u00a0\n\n\n**Learnings from the global voluntary carbon market**\n\n\nUnlike compliance markets, voluntary markets are usually partially regulated and market-driven. Hence, multiple agencies with their own standards, eligibility criteria and terminologies exist. Offset standards, including Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard, verify the projects and ensure they follow strict rules and maintain high environmental integrity standards. However, these standards usually only assess the original offsetting project and not the broader ecosystem, allowing companies to prioritise whatever makes the most financial sense.\u00a0\n\n\nAs India sets the foundation for its domestic carbon market, it is crucial to understand the governance structure for voluntary carbon markets. Will the National Steering Committee decide the standards, or will they remain open for the industries to take a call on? Would there be interoperability between voluntary carbon credits bought or sold in the international carbon market and the domestic voluntary market?\u00a0\n\n\nIEEFA welcomes the efforts taken by MoP to develop the Indian carbon market. Still, operationalising the market requires more efforts on consumer profiling, target setting, cross-ministerial coordination and robust monitoring and verification. The carbon market would help corporations become carbon neutral. In addition to the compliance market, clarity on the timeline and structure of the voluntary market is crucial considering the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) have already announced plans to explore voluntary carbon market.\u00a0\n\n\n***Views are personal.

Puro.earth\u2019s robust, diverse supplier base offers buyers a rich source of quality removal credits. Xpansiv\u2019s marketplace brings together hundreds of global participants to transact on a centralized, fully transparent exchange platform and post-trade infrastructure.\n\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Xpansiv marks an important step to scale the market for high-quality carbon removal credits, which are essential in private sector, net-zero programs,\u201d said Antti Vihavainen, CEO, Puro.earth. \u201cPuro\u2019s guiding principle has been to establish the least disputable methodologies for carbon removal, which has led to relatively small volumes of available credits for the first years. Now that several new projects are orders of magnitude larger than previously, CBL\u2019s central position in the carbon markets will be critical in enhancing transparent price discovery and liquidity formation, enabling participants to engage with greater certainty and confidence.\u201d\n\n\nThe Puro.earth ecosystem of carbon removers consists of 116 suppliers of negative emissions and another 600 companies in the supplier funnel preparing to get certified.\n\n\n\u201cWe welcome Puro.earth as a valued partner bringing to market innovative carbon removal projects,\u201d said John Melby, CEO, Xpansiv. \u201cOur exchange participants are keen to incorporate removals into their credit portfolios and look forward to trading and managing them through our platform.\u201d\n\n\nThe partnership will enable hundreds of active CBL participants to trade CORCs alongside a broad range of environmental commodities used to finance the global energy transition. In addition to being listed on CBL, CORC transactions will be settled via the exchange\u2019s post-trade service.\n\n\nSource: Puro.earth\n\n\n[Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketsmedia.com%2Fpuro-earth-and-xpansiv-to-scale-carbon-removals-market%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3DSocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare)[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Puro.earth+and+Xpansiv+to+Scale+Carbon+Removals+Market&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketsmedia.com%2Fpuro-earth-and-xpansiv-to-scale-carbon-removals-market%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3DSocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare&via=marketsmedia)[Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketsmedia.com%2Fpuro-earth-and-xpansiv-to-scale-carbon-removals-market%2F%3Futm_source%3Dlinkedin%26utm_medium%3DSocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare)\n\n\n\n\n![](/wp-content/themes/Markets_Media_RS/static/img/email.svg)\n\n\n### NEWSLETTER SIGN UP\n\n\nAnd receive exclusive articles on securities markets\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}], [{"source": "S&P Global", "title": "Voluntary carbon market players hope new quality guidance will boost liquidity", "link": "https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/072723-voluntary-carbon-market-players-hope-new-quality-guidance-will-boost-liquidity", "summary": "- The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market has unveiled its Assessment Framework for evaluating the quality of carbon credits.\n- The framework sets criteria for credits to meet the Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) and obtain the CCP label.\n- The release of the framework is expected to bring more certainty to the market and encourage more carbon reduction and removal projects.\n- The framework requires credits to fund projects compatible with a transition to net zero, permanent, additional, and quantified.\n- The voluntary carbon market has been facing scrutiny and declining liquidity and prices.\n- The market expects high-integrity credits to trade at a premium, incentivizing the adoption of the CCP criteria.\n- The ICVCM plans to establish working groups to assess different categories of carbon credits against the CCP criteria.\n- The governance body intends to update and strengthen the CCPs and framework over time.\n- Full clarity on CCP-eligible credit categories and methodologies is still awaited, limiting potential market upsides.\n- Quality concerns regarding projects are likely to persist despite the introduction of assessment frameworks.\n- The VCMI launched the Claims Code of Practice to bring integrity to the demand side of voluntary carbon markets.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryN1", "reason": "The article provides information about the unveiling of a framework for defining high-quality carbon offsets and its potential impact on the carbon market."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses the unveiling of a framework for high-quality carbon offsets, which is seen as a positive step towards addressing carbon emissions and bringing more certainty to the carbon market."}, "content": "\n\nA much-awaited framework that helps define high-quality carbon offsets was unveiled July 27, with labeled credits available to buyers by end-2023.\n\n\n\n###### Not registered?\n\n\n\r\n Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.\r\n \n\n\n[Register Now](\\commodityinsights\\en\\register)\n\nThe Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market said that it has finalized its Assessment Framework, which will be used to evaluate whether carbon credits meet its high-integrity Core Carbon Principles (CCPs).\n\n\nMany in the industry are hopeful this release will bring more certainty to the market and lead to more carbon reduction and removal projects.\n\n\nAnnette Nazareth, chair of the ICVCM, said the voluntary carbon markets now have a global threshold for quality, which could solve some of the confidence and credibility issues that this market is facing.\n\n\n\"We know there is strong demand for high-integrity credits and the CCP label will give more companies confidence to invest. We expect high-integrity credits to trade at a premium, which will incentivize the market to adopt CCP criteria,\" she added.\n\n\nThis guidance comes at a crucial juncture for the $2 billion voluntary carbon market. Growing scrutiny over the efficacy of some carbon offsets and projects has led to a sharp fall in both liquidity and prices.\n\n\nS&P Global Commodity Insights' Platts CNC assessment -- which reflects the most competitive nature-based carbon credit prices -- reached $2.45/mtCO2e on July 26, up from a record low of $1/mtCO2e on May 29. Platts CNC averaged $9.55/mtC02e in 2022, S&P Global data showed.\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/5ffe4f0b-78a8-4e05-b4aa-e094996519d3.svg)\n\n\n\n\n### High bar\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assessment framework sets out criteria that carbon-crediting programs and categories of carbon credits will have to follow to meet the CCP label.\n\n\nTo qualify for this label, credits must fund projects that are compatible with a transition to net zero, permanent, additional and robustly quantified, according to the framework.\n\n\nKelley Kizzier from ICVCM's Governing Board said a key objective of the framework was to ensure that the highest quality carbon credits rise to the top, and trade at high prices.\n\n\n\"I think what we've really tried to do is set a high bar, but not a bar so high that it would be impossible to achieve,\" Kizzier said in an interview with S&P Global. \"I think we hope to see a cycle of continuous improvement in the voluntary carbon market and for more consistency across the major carbon crediting programs in terms of their rules.\"\n\n\nMany crediting program and standards are already reviewing and updating their methodologies.\n\n\nVerra, the world's leading carbon registry, is in the process of finalized its methodology for REDD+ projects by the fourth quarter of 2023, as it looks to improve the quality of its forest carbon offsets.\n\n\nThe registry is also looking to strengthen and update the program rules of its Verified Carbon Standard, which is the world's most widely used greenhouse gas (GHG) crediting program.\n\n\nIn late-March, the ICVCM released its Core Carbon Principles, laying out the attributes of a high integrity carbon credit.\n\n\nThe CCPs include 10 codes that are broadly based under three groups: governance; emissions impact and sustainable development.\n\n\n\n### Quality concerns\n\n\n\n\n\nDana Agrotti, a Carbon Markets Analyst at S&P Global, said the ICVCM has now provided some clarity to the market but an upswing in prices and liquidity is unlikely till the first half of next year.\n\n\n\"Expectations that clear definitions would be provided as to what credit categories will and won't be CCP-eligible have been somewhat met, with indications that enhanced oil recovery projects, among others, won't comply with the principles,\" she added.\n\n\n\"However, the market continues to wait for clear signals from the ICVCM as to which credit categories and methodologies will receive the CCP label. Until then, we continue to expect limited upsides for the market, amid wider liquidity issues.\"\n\n\nSome market participants forewarned that quality concerns of projects are likely to persist.\n\n\nThese initiatives are not a silver bullet that can solve the challenge of carbon credit quality, according to Sebastien Cross, chief innovation officer at carbon ratings agency BeZero Carbon\n\n\n\"Criticism about the VCM has largely, and rightly, focused on notable failures to deliver at a project level,\" he said.\n\n\n\"Although assessment frameworks may increase overall quality, ultimately some projects will still be more effective than others -- a spectrum of quality will always exist. Assessing credit quality does not stop at the CCPs, but requires the project level approach that ratings provide as a tool,\" he added.\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/9fa7e42c-4847-422d-a001-0483b95b0064.svg)\n\n\n\n\n### Strengthen over time\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ICVCM said it will start establishing several multi-stakeholder working groups to assess different categories of carbon credits and associated crediting methodologies against the CCP criteria and recommend those that meet the threshold.\n\n\nThe governance body also has plans to update and strengthen the CCPs and framework over time, \"learning lessons from experience, reflecting scientific and technical advances, and taking market developments into account.\"\n\n\n\"We are already planning for the next version by setting up work programs to ensure that important and technically complex areas receive dedicated and focused attention from experts,\" said William McDonnell, ICVCM's chief operating officer.\n\n\nThis comes a month after the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative launched its Claims Code of Practice, which outlines guidelines for companies to credibly make voluntary use of carbon credits.\n\n\nThe Claims Code of Practice, which aims to bring integrity to the demand side of voluntary carbon markets, consists of three tiers of claims that companies can make \u2013 Platinum, Gold and Silver.\n\n\nThe VCMI, which is involved in setting rules on the demand side of the VCM, is also working with the ICVCM to develop an integrated market integrity framework to improve the quality of carbon offsets.\n\n\n"}, {"source": "Reuters", "title": "Global standards launched to grow $2 billion voluntary carbon market", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/global-standards-launched-boost-2-bln-voluntary-carbon-market-2023-07-26/", "summary": "- A global initiative is aiming to issue labelled credits by the end of the year to make the unregulated carbon offset marketplace more transparent.\n- The initiative aims to set a global threshold for quality and unlock finance for emissions-reducing projects.\n- New standards, called Core Carbon Principle (CCP) standards, have been published by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market.\n- CCP approval will require quantified monitoring, reporting, and verification standards, along with additional governance checks.\n- Technology involving carbon capture and storage at projects involving oil recovery will be excluded from the CCPs.\n- Companies retiring carbon credits will be required to disclose their name and credits cannot be traded or used by another company once retired.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryD1", "reason": "The article mentions companies with net-zero goals buying carbon offsets to cancel out emissions elsewhere."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article highlights efforts to make the carbon offset marketplace more transparent and sets global standards for emissions-reducing projects, indicating a positive sentiment towards addressing carbon emissions."}, "content": "LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - A global initiative to grow the $2 billion market for carbon offsets outlined criteria for new voluntary standards on Thursday, and said it aims to issue labelled credits by the year-end to make the unregulated marketplace more transparent.\n\nDemand for carbon offsets - credits for emissions-reducing activity that can be generated through projects such as tree planting - is expected to increase as companies with net-zero goals buy them to cancel out emissions elsewhere.\n\nBut the market is unregulated, with many different standards and approaches making it difficult for companies to assess which credits they should use.\n\nCritics of the market cite concerns including a lack of transparency and question the environmental quality of projects.\n\nThe Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), an independent governance body, has published its criteria for projects to achieve its new Core Carbon Principle (CCP) standards.\n\nThe criteria \"set a global threshold for quality which aims to unlock finance at speed and scale for projects to reduce and remove billions of tonnes of emissions that would not otherwise be viable,\" Integrity Council Chair Annette Nazareth said in a statement.\n\nUntil now, the most widely traded offsets abide by criteria established under the CORSIA scheme for the global airline industry.\n\nCCP approval will require many of the same features as CORSIA, such as a project having quantified monitoring, reporting and verification standards, or being unable to go ahead without the revenue from the sale of carbon credits.\n\nHowever, CCP credits will require additional measures, such as further governance checks.

However, it also highlights uncertainties and limitations in operationalizing the market."}, "content": "Economies globally have recognised the urgency of limiting carbon emissions to fight climate change. Putting a price on carbon emissions by developing a trading system (carbon market) to buy and sell carbon credits is one way to limit emissions. The Ministry of Power\u2019s (MoP) recent Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023 aims at creating a domestic market for tracking and trading carbon credits. The policy is a step in the right direction for setting up India's compliance and voluntary carbon markets. Still, several questions remain unanswered on whether it operationalises the market.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe concept of carbon credit is not new in India. The domestic carbon compliance market has existed for a long time in the form of Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) for tradable energy certificates (ESCerts) by designated consumers in industrial units from energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium, cement, chlor-alkali, fertiliser, iron & steel, paper & pulp, railways, thermal power and textile. The Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for renewable energy certificates (RECs) by generators producing electricity from clean sources like solar, wind, biomass, small hydro and municipal solid waste is another form of carbon compliance. Further, the Energy Conservation Act 2001 also discusses issuing carbon credit certificates to registered entities.\u00a0\n\n\nCCTS will now encompass the existing trading mechanism by transitioning from tonnes of oil equivalent (ESCerts) to carbon certificates expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. \u00a0\n\n\nThe CCTS notification lays the framework and structure of the domestic carbon market. It constitutes a National Steering Committee comprising representatives from key ministries to govern the domestic carbon market. This committee will give recommendations to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for establishing emissions targets and trajectories for obligated entities under the compliance mechanism and lay guidelines for issuing and trading carbon credit certificates outside India.\u00a0\n\n\nEssentially, BEE will become an administrator and develop procedures and eligibility criteria for accrediting carbon verification agencies. The Grid Controller of India will handle the meta registry for obligated and non-obligated entities under the compliance and voluntary carbon markets, respectively. Meanwhile, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will regulate the trading of certificates.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) provided a series of comments in response to the draft CCTS released by the MoP in March 2023. The MoP adopted some of the suggestions, including setting up a meta registry that will be compatible with international registries, the inclusion of the non-power sector, a pathway for setting targets for emission reduction and inclusion of PAT and REC. But, the notification falls short of clarifying the operationalisation aspects, including eligible consumers, price discovery, voluntary market mechanisms and linking the domestic carbon market with the international markets to attract finance and technology.\u00a0\n\n\n**Timeline for operationalising the market**\n\n\nThe notification does not provide a timeline for operationalising the carbon market, including which section of the market is likely to start first. It defines obligated entities as those notified under the compliance mechanism and non-obligated entities as those that can purchase carbon credit certificates voluntarily. This definition and stakeholder consultations held by the BEE suggest that obligated entities are those that the existing PAT scheme covers. The current cycle for PAT continues until 2025. It is unclear whether the CCTS mandates all or some of these entities to transfer to the carbon credit market. As such, it will be useful to understand the timeline. Some newspaper reports discuss starting the voluntary carbon market right away. This requires clarity on the sectors and a timeline for targets and processes.\u00a0\n\n\n**Limited specification on the sectors eligible to participate in the domestic carbon market**\n\n\nThe notification states that the MoP will notify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity targets to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), based on recommendations from BEE. Obligated entities will have to achieve these targets along with any other targets, such as non-fossil energy consumption or specific energy consumption, as per the MoP\u2019s notifications. But there is no clarity on the eligibility of the sectors and industries under this scheme. The eleven sectors identified by the National Carbon Market include petroleum refineries, cement, steel, chlor-alkali, aluminium, thermal power plants and fertilisers. Will the list expand to add more sectors? If yes, then the question is how will these additional sectors be identified. \u00a0\n\n\n**Aligning with the existing domestic market**\n\n\nThe Green Credit Programme (GCP) announced by MoEFCC aims to incentivise environmentally conscious practises via trading green credits. This will be a purely voluntary market covering eight sectors, primarily affecting rural areas. The sectors focus on increasing tree cover, promoting water conservation, adopting natural and regenerative agricultural practices, improving soil health and the nutritional value of food, managing waste effectively and reducing air pollution. \u00a0\n\n\nThese activities under GCP may generate green credits and carbon credits from the same activity under the carbon market. If this is so, how are the two different? What would be the potential use of green credits if they also generate carbon credits that could be sold in the domestic market? How will the two markets intersect or overlap?\u00a0\n\n\n**Linkages with international carbon markets**\n\n\nIndia has been participating in the sale of carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) route and private sector-driven voluntary carbon market. Between 2010 and 2022, India issued 278 million credits in the voluntary carbon market, accounting for 17 per cent of global supply, according to the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Special report by S&P Global Commodity Insights. With the domestic carbon market now in place, it is unclear whether the global carbon credit certificates will run parallel to the domestic ones. \u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, is there a need to regulate (if yes, how?) carbon credits exported for trade in the international voluntary carbon market? Such decisions will impact India\u2019s strategy to welcome foreign direct investment in decarbonisation activities.\u00a0\n\n\n**Getting the pricing right for carbon credits**\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the carbon market will depend on the accuracy of carbon price discovery. If the buying price is too high, it will deter participation, especially from micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). If the selling price is too low, there will be no incentive for real emissions reduction.\u00a0\n\n\nHence, a robust methodology for price discovery and some pilots will be necessary going forward. The methodology should clearly lay out the process for price discovery based on sectoral or unit-wise emission targets. It also needs structured checks and balances to ensure market stability and prevent an oversupply or overdemand of credits.\u00a0\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon market requires even greater efforts as price discovery is more complex considering the variety in project sizes, location, quality, value adds, and more. The scheme seems to focus on the compliance market, providing limited guidance for non-obligated entities. Enhancing private sector participation in the voluntary carbon market needs a more structured and incentive-driven mechanism.\u00a0\n\n\n**Learnings from the global voluntary carbon market**\n\n\nUnlike compliance markets, voluntary markets are usually partially regulated and market-driven. Hence, multiple agencies with their own standards, eligibility criteria and terminologies exist. Offset standards, including Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard, verify the projects and ensure they follow strict rules and maintain high environmental integrity standards. However, these standards usually only assess the original offsetting project and not the broader ecosystem, allowing companies to prioritise whatever makes the most financial sense.\u00a0\n\n\nAs India sets the foundation for its domestic carbon market, it is crucial to understand the governance structure for voluntary carbon markets. Will the National Steering Committee decide the standards, or will they remain open for the industries to take a call on? Would there be interoperability between voluntary carbon credits bought or sold in the international carbon market and the domestic voluntary market?\u00a0\n\n\nIEEFA welcomes the efforts taken by MoP to develop the Indian carbon market. Still, operationalising the market requires more efforts on consumer profiling, target setting, cross-ministerial coordination and robust monitoring and verification. The carbon market would help corporations become carbon neutral. In addition to the compliance market, clarity on the timeline and structure of the voluntary market is crucial considering the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) have already announced plans to explore voluntary carbon market.\u00a0\n\n\n***Views are personal.

carbon credits sufficiently, an industry watchdog has warned.**\n\n\n**Although broadly welcoming the ICVCM's new guidelines, analysts at Carbon Market Watch have raised concerns that the update will set a minimum threshold rather than a high bar for carbon markets, which in turn will leave too many loopholes and ambiguities to truly tackle the climate crisis.**\n\n\n[Log in or register to see

Stefan Feuchtinger is the head of market research and analysis at Vertis Environmental Finance.*\n\n\nThe EU ETS is the cornerstone of European policy to tackle climate change and encourage the decarbonisation of heavy industries. It is a market-based mechanism, meaning that the price companies must pay to emit greenhouse gas emissions varies with supply and demand.\n\n\nAs part of the Fit for 55 package, the recent market reform has brought important changes, especially tightening the supply from next year onwards. This has created the expectation that EUAs, emission allowances, and, therefore, polluting costs could only go up.\n\n\nYet, the timing and interrelation of how supply interacts with demand make it a less straightforward conclusion.\n\n\n**First half of the year was less bullish for EUAs than expected**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn the first half of 2023, power emissions experienced a significant drop of around 17% compared to the previous year, translating to approximately 125 million allowances annually should this trend persist until the end of 2023.\n\n\nFew had expected such a significant drop, at least by the beginning of the year. A warm winter, low industrial demand, high renewable penetration, and dropping gas prices led to this situation.\n\n\nOur model anticipates a slightly less bearish but still remarkable decline of approximately 14.8% in power emissions for the entirety of 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n\n![](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/oped1.jpg)\n\n\nCheaper gas triggered a shift in favour of gas-powered generation over coal, hence leading to the Clean Spark Spread (CSS), representing the theoretical profit margin of an average gas power plant, surpassing the Clean Dark Spread (CDS), reflecting the profitability of an average coal power plant.\n\n\nConsequently, utilities that had previously hedged their coal power production began to unwind their hedges, at least partially. In other words, it means a sale of EUAs back into the market.\n\n\nThis fuel-switching phenomenon implies that when the costs of switching from coal to gas are below zero, it becomes economically advantageous to do so. The margins for fuel switching vary depending on the efficiency of different coal and gas turbines, making it a gauge for the profitability of running gas over coal.\n\n\n![](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/oped2.jpg)\n\n\nIn the near term, the negative fuel switching costs have prompted utilities to sell back EUAs previously locked up in hedges.\n\n\nHowever, hedging for coal-powered generation in 2024 is still economically viable, and utilities are expected to continue hedging their year-ahead generation, albeit slower.\n\n\nThe expectation is for utility hedging speed to gradually increase in 2023. The main point of uncertainty is whether it will reach pre-crisis levels.\n\n\n![](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/oped3.jpg)\n\n\nThe data on investment funds\u2019 behaviour, covering most hedge funds and trading houses, has shown shifts from consecutive net length to net short positions since H2-22.\n\n\nHedge funds have ventured into net short positions three times since August 2022. A record net short position of 25 million EUAs by the week ending June 2nd triggered a short squeeze, leading to bullish pressure and subsequent covering of short positions.\u00a0As a result, CO2 prices increased to around \u20ac94.85 by June 20th before settling at \u20ac89.08 on June 30th.\n\n\nSince then, hedge funds\u2019 net positions were hovering around the level of 0, confirming our hypothesis that they were waiting on the sidelines after the short position blew up. The latest data contradict the views that funds were staying on the sideline, they are now 8.5m long.\n\n\n![](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/oped4.jpg)\n\n\n**Mid-term Outlook for 2025 is neutral to bullish \u2013 with volatility**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBased on the supply and demand analysis, EUA prices are expected to trade largely sideways on conflicting fundamentals, with an eventual uptick. The forecast predicts an average price of \u20ac108 in 2024 and \u20ac112/EUAs by the end of 2025.\n\n\n![](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/oped5.jpg)\n\n\n**The long-term Outlook to 2030 remains bullish unless\u2026**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn the long term, we expect price fundamentals to be bullish due to the yearly decreasing cap, in line with \u201cfit for 55\u201d targets. The TNAC (Total Number of Allowances in Circulation) is expected to shift downward by 2026 due to a combination of cap reductions, RePowerEU volume frontloading, and the shipping sector\u2019s shift to a significant short position by 2026.\n\n\nThe balance between decreasing supply and demand reductions is expected to tilt towards a tighter market in the decade\u2019s second half.\n\n\nThe main risk exposure of this bullish development is even more substantial emission reductions \u2013 i.e. massive decarbonisation in the industrial sectors, whether by better technology or due to carbon leakage. No one has a crystal ball on this, but one thing is clear: EUAs will not see a ceiling any time soon without major decarbonisation.\n\n\n![](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/oped6.jpg)\n\n\nThe fact that hard coal and lignite are pushed out of Europe\u2019s power mix results from several factors, including the EU ETS. If EUAs keep rising, we expect the power sector decarbonisation to accelerate over the following years.\n\n\nIndustry, meanwhile, had been shielded from the full impact of the ETS for years. With the latest ETS reform, that seems to be a thing of the past as changing free allocation rules will mean that every euro of EUA price increase will often mean hundreds of thousands of euros taken out of the pocket of industrials \u2013 unless they find ways to decarbonise.\n\n\n"}, {"source": "Business Today", "title": "Here\u2019s why crucial aspects of India\u2019s carbon market need clarity", "link": "https://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/columns/story/heres-why-crucial-aspects-of-indias-carbon-market-need-clarity-391502-2023-07-27", "summary": "- The Ministry of Power (MoP) has introduced the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) to create a domestic market for tracking and trading carbon credits in India.\n- The CCTS will transition from tradable energy certificates to carbon certificates expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2).\n- The notification lays out the framework, structure, and governance of the domestic carbon market, including the establishment of a National Steering Committee.\n- The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) will be responsible for accrediting carbon verification agencies, while the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will regulate the trading of certificates.\n- The notification falls short in clarifying operationalization aspects such as eligible consumers, price discovery, and linking the domestic carbon market with international markets.\n- There is no specified timeline for operationalizing the carbon market, and there is limited specification on the sectors eligible to participate.\n- The Green Credit Program aims to incentivize environmentally conscious practices and overlaps with the carbon market, raising questions about their intersection and potential use of green credits.\n- There is uncertainty regarding the linkage between the domestic and international carbon markets and the need to regulate carbon credits exported for trade.\n- Effective price discovery for carbon credits is crucial for market participation, requiring a robust methodology and pilots.\n- The governance structure for voluntary carbon markets and the standards and eligibility criteria need to be defined for India's domestic carbon market.\n- Operationalizing the market requires further efforts in consumer profiling, target setting, cross-ministerial coordination, and monitoring and verification.", "classification": {"category": "CategoryN1", "reason": "The article discusses the Ministry of Power's Carbon Credit Trading Scheme and the establishment of a domestic carbon market in India."}, "sentiment": {"score": 4, "reason": "The article discusses the establishment of a domestic carbon market in India, which is a positive step in addressing carbon emissions and climate change."}, "content": "Economies globally have recognised the urgency of limiting carbon emissions to fight climate change. Putting a price on carbon emissions by developing a trading system (carbon market) to buy and sell carbon credits is one way to limit emissions. The Ministry of Power\u2019s (MoP) recent Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023 aims at creating a domestic market for tracking and trading carbon credits. The policy is a step in the right direction for setting up India's compliance and voluntary carbon markets. Still, several questions remain unanswered on whether it operationalises the market.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe concept of carbon credit is not new in India. The domestic carbon compliance market has existed for a long time in the form of Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) for tradable energy certificates (ESCerts) by designated consumers in industrial units from energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium, cement, chlor-alkali, fertiliser, iron & steel, paper & pulp, railways, thermal power and textile. The Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) for renewable energy certificates (RECs) by generators producing electricity from clean sources like solar, wind, biomass, small hydro and municipal solid waste is another form of carbon compliance. Further, the Energy Conservation Act 2001 also discusses issuing carbon credit certificates to registered entities.\u00a0\n\n\nCCTS will now encompass the existing trading mechanism by transitioning from tonnes of oil equivalent (ESCerts) to carbon certificates expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. \u00a0\n\n\nThe CCTS notification lays the framework and structure of the domestic carbon market. It constitutes a National Steering Committee comprising representatives from key ministries to govern the domestic carbon market. This committee will give recommendations to the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for establishing emissions targets and trajectories for obligated entities under the compliance mechanism and lay guidelines for issuing and trading carbon credit certificates outside India.\u00a0\n\n\nEssentially, BEE will become an administrator and develop procedures and eligibility criteria for accrediting carbon verification agencies. The Grid Controller of India will handle the meta registry for obligated and non-obligated entities under the compliance and voluntary carbon markets, respectively. Meanwhile, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will regulate the trading of certificates.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) provided a series of comments in response to the draft CCTS released by the MoP in March 2023. The MoP adopted some of the suggestions, including setting up a meta registry that will be compatible with international registries, the inclusion of the non-power sector, a pathway for setting targets for emission reduction and inclusion of PAT and REC. But, the notification falls short of clarifying the operationalisation aspects, including eligible consumers, price discovery, voluntary market mechanisms and linking the domestic carbon market with the international markets to attract finance and technology.\u00a0\n\n\n**Timeline for operationalising the market**\n\n\nThe notification does not provide a timeline for operationalising the carbon market, including which section of the market is likely to start first. It defines obligated entities as those notified under the compliance mechanism and non-obligated entities as those that can purchase carbon credit certificates voluntarily. This definition and stakeholder consultations held by the BEE suggest that obligated entities are those that the existing PAT scheme covers. The current cycle for PAT continues until 2025. It is unclear whether the CCTS mandates all or some of these entities to transfer to the carbon credit market. As such, it will be useful to understand the timeline. Some newspaper reports discuss starting the voluntary carbon market right away. This requires clarity on the sectors and a timeline for targets and processes.\u00a0\n\n\n**Limited specification on the sectors eligible to participate in the domestic carbon market**\n\n\nThe notification states that the MoP will notify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity targets to the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), based on recommendations from BEE. Obligated entities will have to achieve these targets along with any other targets, such as non-fossil energy consumption or specific energy consumption, as per the MoP\u2019s notifications. But there is no clarity on the eligibility of the sectors and industries under this scheme. The eleven sectors identified by the National Carbon Market include petroleum refineries, cement, steel, chlor-alkali, aluminium, thermal power plants and fertilisers. Will the list expand to add more sectors? If yes, then the question is how will these additional sectors be identified. \u00a0\n\n\n**Aligning with the existing domestic market**\n\n\nThe Green Credit Programme (GCP) announced by MoEFCC aims to incentivise environmentally conscious practises via trading green credits. This will be a purely voluntary market covering eight sectors, primarily affecting rural areas. The sectors focus on increasing tree cover, promoting water conservation, adopting natural and regenerative agricultural practices, improving soil health and the nutritional value of food, managing waste effectively and reducing air pollution. \u00a0\n\n\nThese activities under GCP may generate green credits and carbon credits from the same activity under the carbon market. If this is so, how are the two different? What would be the potential use of green credits if they also generate carbon credits that could be sold in the domestic market? How will the two markets intersect or overlap?\u00a0\n\n\n**Linkages with international carbon markets**\n\n\nIndia has been participating in the sale of carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) route and private sector-driven voluntary carbon market. Between 2010 and 2022, India issued 278 million credits in the voluntary carbon market, accounting for 17 per cent of global supply, according to the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Special report by S&P Global Commodity Insights. With the domestic carbon market now in place, it is unclear whether the global carbon credit certificates will run parallel to the domestic ones. \u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, is there a need to regulate (if yes, how?) carbon credits exported for trade in the international voluntary carbon market? Such decisions will impact India\u2019s strategy to welcome foreign direct investment in decarbonisation activities.\u00a0\n\n\n**Getting the pricing right for carbon credits**\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the carbon market will depend on the accuracy of carbon price discovery. If the buying price is too high, it will deter participation, especially from micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). If the selling price is too low, there will be no incentive for real emissions reduction.\u00a0\n\n\nHence, a robust methodology for price discovery and some pilots will be necessary going forward. The methodology should clearly lay out the process for price discovery based on sectoral or unit-wise emission targets. It also needs structured checks and balances to ensure market stability and prevent an oversupply or overdemand of credits.\u00a0\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon market requires even greater efforts as price discovery is more complex considering the variety in project sizes, location, quality, value adds, and more. The scheme seems to focus on the compliance market, providing limited guidance for non-obligated entities. Enhancing private sector participation in the voluntary carbon market needs a more structured and incentive-driven mechanism.\u00a0\n\n\n**Learnings from the global voluntary carbon market**\n\n\nUnlike compliance markets, voluntary markets are usually partially regulated and market-driven. Hence, multiple agencies with their own standards, eligibility criteria and terminologies exist. Offset standards, including Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard, verify the projects and ensure they follow strict rules and maintain high environmental integrity standards. However, these standards usually only assess the original offsetting project and not the broader ecosystem, allowing companies to prioritise whatever makes the most financial sense.\u00a0\n\n\nAs India sets the foundation for its domestic carbon market, it is crucial to understand the governance structure for voluntary carbon markets. Will the National Steering Committee decide the standards, or will they remain open for the industries to take a call on? Would there be interoperability between voluntary carbon credits bought or sold in the international carbon market and the domestic voluntary market?\u00a0\n\n\nIEEFA welcomes the efforts taken by MoP to develop the Indian carbon market. Still, operationalising the market requires more efforts on consumer profiling, target setting, cross-ministerial coordination and robust monitoring and verification. The carbon market would help corporations become carbon neutral. In addition to the compliance market, clarity on the timeline and structure of the voluntary market is crucial considering the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) have already announced plans to explore voluntary carbon market.\u00a0\n\n\n***Views are personal.
