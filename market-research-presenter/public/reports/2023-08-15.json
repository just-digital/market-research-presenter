The trapped CO2 can then be safely stored underground, deep in the ocean or converted into useful carbon products like concrete, which would prevent its release back into the air.\n\n\nProject Cypress will be built in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana and the South Texas DAC is planned for Kleberg County, Texas. Both sites are designed to capture up to 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year initially. Officials said the projects will create over 4,500 jobs for local workers and people formerly employed in the fossil fuel industry.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reader support helps sustain our work.

[Here's How](https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist)\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis carbon capture and sequestration involves stripping CO2 out of the air and putting it somewhere,\u201d Sigman said. \u201cCarbon capture is something that people become interested in when it\u2019s too late to prevent carbon dioxide emissions. \u201c\n\n\nHowever, some scientists think the initiative [is a waste of money](https://www.science.org/content/article/us-unveils-plans-for-large-facilities-to-capture-carbon-directly-from-air) because DAC requires a significant amount of energy to purify\u00a0CO2 and store it, making it one of the most expensive and inefficient ways to sequester carbon.\n\n\nThe initiative is being funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and is part of a Department of Energy initiative which aims to build a nationwide network of large-scale carbon removal sites to mitigate the climate crisis.\n\n\n\u201cCutting back on our carbon emissions alone won\u2019t reverse the growing impacts of climate change; we also need to remove the CO2 that we\u2019ve already put in the atmosphere\u2014which nearly every climate model makes clear is essential to achieving a net-zero global economy by 2050,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M.

[Here's How](https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist)\n\n\n\n\nThe funding for the project was noted as the world\u2019s largest-ever investment in engineered carbon removal, with each new hub expected to clear more than 250 times more carbon dioxide from the air than the largest direct air capturing facility currently operating.\n\n\nSigman said getting the technology right for something of this magnitude is tricky. With carbon dioxide making up around 420 parts per million of molecules it\u2019s a challenge to come up with chemical means to strip those molecules out of the air, he said.\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cCarbon dioxide is throughout our whole atmosphere,\u201d said Sigman. \u201cSo we have to think about how much our atmosphere is going to be passing through Texas and Louisiana, we have to think about how much of our atmosphere will be passing through these areas.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nA message from \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Your support keeps our climate news free\n\n\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

and storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas. The project developers are tasked with removing one million tons of carbon dioxide per year from the atmosphere and storing the greenhouse gas deep underground.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is still far from profitable and the existing solutions [haven\u2019t shown](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/ieefa-relying-on-carbon-capture-in-fossil-fuel-sector-will-not-work/) sufficient [if any efficiency.](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/carbon-capture-projects-failing-but-still-may-play-role-in-energy-transition/) The market for sequestering carbon dioxide [at the source](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/three-carbon-capture-projects-in-balkans-get-grants-from-eus-innovation-fund/) of emissions, in industrial facilities, is undeveloped. The situation is even more difficult for investors in direct air capture (DAC), struggling to find funding, as carbon removal only spends money.\n\n\nProponents say things may change when demand rises for [synthetic fuels,](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/wabio-from-germany-to-build-20-biogas-plants-in-serbia/) which are produced from captured CO2. Carbon can be utilized in various industries, for instance in the production of concrete or even [diamonds or vodka.](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/new-york-city-startup-air-co-produces-vodka-from-captured-co2/)\n\n\nThe third and easiest way to sequester CO2 is to increase the ability of [soil](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/soil-carbon-storage-in-agriculture-for-climate-and-trade-bonds-and-profits/) to absorb carbon by sustainably managing agriculture and forestry and thus stimulating photosynthesis.\n\n\n### Critics claim CCS is excuse for fossil fuel industry to keep pumping oil, gas\n\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has acknowledged the need for DAC for long-term storage, to mitigate climate change. The United States is determined to come out on top in the field and it is competing with [the European Union](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/eu-launches-subsidy-plan-to-protect-its-green-industry/) in [supporting](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/eu-to-abolish-free-co2-emission-allowances-for-companies-in-2034/) and attracting such investments.\n\n\n\n> The carbon from CO2 can also be turned into rock\n> \n> \n\n\nCritics say public money should be spent on the clean energy transition and other forms of decarbonization, and accuse the fossil fuel industry of supporting and developing carbon capture, utilization and storage projects to have an excuse to keep producing oil, gas and petrochemicals.\n\n\n### Major oil company\u2019s subsidiary heads one of two winning projects\n\n\nThe Department of Energy in Washington DC has just declared the first two winners in its program and awarded a bunch of grants for research and studies from its DAC chest of USD 3.5 billion. It said it aims to pick the remaining two hubs next year.\n\n\nThe consortium that got up to USD 602 million approved is actually led by a subsidiary of [Occidental Petroleum](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/fossil-fuel-giant-occidental-to-capture-carbon-on-behalf-of-airbus/) (also known as Oxy) \u2013 1PointFive. With its partners \u2013 Canada-based Carbon Engineering and American-Australian engineering firm WorleyParsons, going as Worley, it is building the South Texas DAC Hub.\n\n\nLocated in Kleberg County, the complex would push the sequestered greenhouse gas more than three kilometers below ground to permanently store it. The idea is also to store CO2 captured in industrial facilities on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n### Both hubs to be powered by renewables\n\n\nThe second winner, Project Cypress DAC Hub, is under development in southwest Louisiana. It is eligible for USD 500 million to USD 600 million.\n\n\nThe project is run by private nonprofit scientific organization Battelle Memorial Institute from Columbus, Ohio, Climeworks and Heirloom Carbon Technologies. The last of the three is working on ways to mineralize carbon, like what the world\u2019s currently largest CCS facility in [Iceland](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/bulgarian-cement-plant-gets-eu-grant-for-innovative-carbon-capture-storage-project/) does. It is run by Climeworks.\n\n\n\n> Developers of the South Texas DAC Hub hinted that they aim to make more machines at the site to achieve an annual capacity of 30 million tons\n> \n> \n\n\nBoth projects are planned to be powered from renewable sources and are aimed at reaching an annual capacity of one million tons of CO2 each. The developers of the Texas hub said they aspire to build 29 more equivalent carbon removal units at the site and estimated the storage potential at three billion tons.\n\n\nThe two hubs are envisaged to employ a total of 5,000 people. Neither is intended for enhanced oil recovery, which is when captured CO2 is injected into almost depleted wells to squeeze out the remaining oil.\n\n\n\n Post Views: 23\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The United States approved up to USD 1.2 billion in grants for two planned direct air capture and storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The approval of grants demonstrates a commitment to investing in carbon capture and storage technology, which is seen as essential for mitigating climate change."}, {"summary": "The market for sequestering carbon dioxide at the source of emissions is undeveloped, making it difficult for investors in direct air capture (DAC) to find funding.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article presents the current state of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) market without indicating positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Proponents believe that demand for synthetic fuels produced from captured CO2 may increase in the future.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The potential for demand growth in synthetic fuels suggests a positive outlook for the carbon capture and storage industry."}, {"summary": "Critics argue that public funds should be spent on clean energy transition and other decarbonization efforts rather than carbon capture and storage projects.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Critics believe that investing in carbon capture and storage projects is a diversion from more impactful decarbonization strategies."}, {"summary": "The Department of Energy has awarded grants to two projects led by Occidental Petroleum and Battelle Memorial Institute for the development of carbon capture and storage hubs.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The awarding of grants indicates a positive step towards advancing carbon capture and storage technology."}, {"summary": "The South Texas DAC Hub aims to achieve an annual capacity of 30 million tons and estimates a storage potential of three billion tons.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The goals of the South Texas DAC Hub reflect a positive outlook for carbon capture and storage technology."}], "semantic_commentary": "Grants approved for carbon capture and storage facilities.\nUndeveloped market for carbon dioxide sequestration.\nDemand for synthetic fuels from captured CO2 may increase.\nCritics argue for spending on clean energy transition instead.\nGrants awarded for carbon capture and storage hub development.", "sentiment_score": 0.5, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the development of carbon capture and storage facilities."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article talks about news related to carbon capture and storage projects and grants awarded by the Department of Energy."}]}, {"source": "Canary Media", "link": "https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/the-carbon-copy/americas-historic-climate-law-one-year-in", "title": "America's historic climate law, one year in | Canary Media", "content": "\n******On****** [The Carbon Copy](https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/the-carbon-copy?token=bzR0kVK6asG7DuM884WY5K6GqOGqB-Sg \"https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/the-carbon-copy?token=bzr0kvk6asg7dum884wy5k6gqogqb-sg\") ******podcast this\u00a0week:******\n\n\nA year after it was passed, the Inflation Reduction Act is already reshaping the climatetech, energy and automotive industries in the U.S.\n\n\nNew factories for a\u00a0wide array of clean energy components are being planned.

The results of the study are described in the journal *Conservation Biology*.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegraded forests include selectively logged areas and others damaged by human activities, but which still retain important natural features. Previous studies have primarily focused on reforestation of clearcut areas, or those converted to agricultural use\u2014including pastures\u2014and subsequently abandoned.\n\n\nHowever, this overlooks the substantial gains to be made by enabling degraded forests to recover. These degraded areas are often found next to intact forest, and their [restoration](https://phys.org/tags/restoration/) could help further protect and enhance these remaining [natural areas](https://phys.org/tags/natural+areas/).\n\n\nRestoring degraded forests represents a strategic and cost-effective option for meeting national and global [climate](https://phys.org/tags/climate/) and biodiversity goals. Degraded forests retain many similarities to natural forests in terms of structure and types of plant species and ecosystems, hence they are more likely to recover rapidly, regain biodiversity levels and store more carbon than cleared land where complete forest restoration will take more time and is less likely to succeed.\n\n\nRestoring degraded forest is also often more cost-effective than reforestation as it may not require the same level of investment in [tree planting](https://phys.org/tags/tree+planting/) and maintenance.\n\n\nThe study highlights the Five Great Forest landscapes of Mesoamerica\u2014an area encompassing parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia that is critical for wildlife, carbon sequestration, clean water, and food security. The inclusion of degraded forests doubled the area of forest restoration opportunity in those landscapes and increased the climate mitigation potential by almost 70%, when compared with reforestation of cleared land.\n\n\nThe study provides a model for prioritizing [restoration efforts](https://phys.org/tags/restoration+efforts/) based on where they can best deliver rapid improvements in forest integrity , where integrity is a metric that represents the opposite of degradation. This prioritization will help land managers and governments target their restoration interventions to maximize efficiency and impact.\n\n\nTim Rayden, WCS Forest Restoration Lead, and lead author of the paper said, \"Forest restoration is sometimes presented as a tradeoff between food security and nature. This is unfortunate, as there is so much scope to restore biodiversity to our farmed landscapes without compromising on food production. But also, as this study shows, because there are such extensive opportunities for nature restoration in degraded forests that don't displace farming activity.\"\n\n\nDr. Kendall Jones, WCS Conservation Planning Specialist and co-author for the paper said, \"Mapping degraded [forest](https://phys.org/tags/forest/) areas means coming to restoration decisions with better information and a better representation of the opportunities\u2014especially those that would bring rapid biodiversity gains, strengthened climate resilience, and valuable benefits for local communities.\"\n\n\nJohn Lotspeich, Executive Director of Trillion Trees commented: \"This study provides us with hope and optimism in what can seem a bleak outlook in the climate crisis. With careful, scientific application we can identify [forest areas](https://phys.org/tags/forest+areas/) that are more cost-effective to restore, and where restoration can rapidly make a significant impact for people, biodiversity and the climate.\"\n\n\nFurther research is needed to more fully quantify the costs and benefits of restoring degraded forests, including those areas that are currently managed for selective logging. This analysis is the first step in recognizing the untapped potential of these areas for climate and [biodiversity](https://phys.org/tags/biodiversity/) solutions.\n \n \n\n\n**More information:**\n Tim Rayden et al, *Conservation Biology* (2023) [DOI: 10.1111/cobi.14163](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14163)\n\n\n\n\n**Journal information:**\n[Conservation Biology](https://phys.org/journals/conservation-biology/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Provided by\n [Wildlife Conservation Society](https://phys.org/partners/wildlife-conservation-society/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Citation**:\n Restoring degraded forests: An under-appreciated climate solution (2023, August 15)\n retrieved 17 August 2023\n from https://phys.org/news/2023-08-degraded-forests-under-appreciated-climate-solution.html\n \n\n This document is subject to copyright.

EBITDA amounted to EUR 34.3 million, down from EUR 44.8 million in the same period last year which was a record second quarter. The streamlining measures that were taken in 2019-2020, followed by implementation of agile revenue management, improved our business model and created a basis for sustaining healthy profitability in our extensive operations internationally. On the other hand, in the last twelve months we have experienced a swift change in the global shipping market, where freight rates decreased substantially before stabilizing at current level, after the extraordinary rate increases driven by the supply chain disruptions of the Covid period, mainly affecting our international forwarding operations as well as the Trans-Atlantic liner services. This change in global environment has reduced the overall cost of transportation for our customers which is positive.\n\nOur liner services delivered sound results in the quarter, despite a slight decrease in volume. Import to Iceland has remained strong on back of a robust economy while export volume was on a lower level than last year, due to various external factors such as lower salmon production, less fishing activity and reduced industrial output. We are pleased with the outcome in Faroe Islands where activity has been on a good level for the better part of the year despite reduced output of farmed salmon. Our Trans-Atlantic services were affected by the global market conditions where we saw rates decline sharply and volume decrease from previous year while the US economy cooled down and international shipping lines shifted capacity from Asian trade lanes over to the Trans-Atlantic routes. Eimskip\u2019s international forwarding services performed quite well in the quarter, despite an anticipated decrease driven by the change in the global market conditions and there was a slight decrease in volume while margins were on a strong level.\n\nThe shipping industry will be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as of 2024. The purpose and goals of the regulation play an important role when it comes to reducing emissions from the industry. We have been preparing for this regulation for some time now, in order to reduce emissions and mitigate the impact it will inevitably have on cost of transportation. In recent years we have taken various initiatives to reduce emissions from our operations, such as investing in larger and newer vessels which are more fuel-efficient than the older vessels replaced, electrification of harbor cranes, the construction of a shore connection for container vessels in Sundah\u00f6fn and adjustments to our sailing system to optimize routes and operations, to name a few. The mitigation measures that we are already working on include further adjustments to the sailing system with the aim of reducing sailed miles and bunker consumption, further slow steaming where possible, increasing port efficiency to shorten berth time and exploring alternative fuel options. If we look further ahead, we aim to reduce emission even further and meet our ambitious Sustainability goals, by invest in new and more fuel-efficient vessels, hopefully running on alternative green fuel.\n\nWe firmly believe that the foundation for performance is based on employee satisfaction which is why we put strong emphasis on employee wellness and development, both in our strategy and daily operations. We conduct annual engagement surveys to monitor our employees\u2019 engagement, which is one of our most important KPI\u2019s. This year\u2019s survey was conducted in May and we were pleased with the results which show that our engagement level is not only increasing from previous year, but also that we are doing better on this measure that international companies in similar sectors.\n\nThe outlook for coming quarters is generally stable, where a lot of the uncertainty that has characterized the past year has faded out as the global shipping market has stabilized and the economic and geo-political turmoil following the war in Ukraine has somewhat reduced. Our home market in the North-Atlantic is quite robust, where we are experiencing a record tourist season in Iceland, the outlook for the salmon farming industry both in Iceland and Faroe Islands is promising, and we expect our reefer liner services in Norway to pick up in the fall after a traditional slow season during the summer months. The Trans-Atlantic rates have continued to decrease in Q3 which will inevitably affect our revenue in this trade lane, while the volume outlook remains solid thanks to our unique position as the only international carrier with direct services from Europe to Newfoundland and Portland, Maine. There is generally neutral outlook in our international forwarding operations in a market showing signs of stabilization.\u201d\n\n**INVESTOR MEETING 16 AUGUST 2023**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Eimskipaf\u00e9lag \u00cdslands hf. approved the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for 1 January to 30 June 2023 at its meeting on 15 August 2023.

If we\u2019re to avoid the most calamitous consequences of warming our planet, they\u2019ve said, we must radically cut greenhouse gas emissions and get as good at taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as we\u2019ve been at putting it in. Even if solar panels and wind turbines sprout like mushrooms, reaching \u201cnet zero\u201d will require capturing large amounts of emissions from activities that are hard to decarbonize, like making cement. Holding temperatures down will also require vacuuming huge amounts of carbon out of the air. Today, projects devoted to these tasks are too insignificant to come close to reaching these goals. The US is now leading a global push to change that.\u00a0\n\n1. How much more carbon capture is needed?\n\n[Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend.ArrowRight](https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/must-reads/?method=SURL&location=ART&initiative=CTA?itid=lk_cta_ssinline)According to an assessment of carbon-removal efforts globally published in January, currently about two billion metric tons of carbon dioxide are being removed a year. The vast majority of that is achieved through land management \u2013 mainly planting trees. The researchers behind the report, led by the University of Oxford\u2019s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, concluded that to keep temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius above mid-19th century levels by 2050 would require a gigantic step up of that effort. Twice as much carbon would need to be removed by that year on an annual basis using trees and soils, they said, and roughly 1,300 times as much would have to be sucked up using new technologies.\n\nAdvertisementStory continues below advertisement2. Why wouldn\u2019t planting a gazillion more trees get us further?\n\nEveryone likes the idea of planting more trees to pull carbon from the air through photosynthesis. But there\u2019s a limit to this solution. Researchers in 2017 estimated that reforestation and other such \u201cnatural climate solutions\u201d could produce 37% of the cuts needed by 2030 to put the world on track to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. But that much tree-planting would likely require high-quality land three times the size of India. And meanwhile, global warming has made it even more difficult to protect the forests we already have, in the Amazon and elsewhere. Higher temperatures dry out vegetation, leaving them combustible. Among the countries recently affected by wildfires are Greece, Portugal, Canada and the US. The number of fires and area of burned forest doubled in the western US between the 1980s and 2010s. What\u2019s more, trees need decades to start pulling down CO\u2082 at the needed scale \u2014 time the world doesn\u2019t have to zero-out emissions.\n\n3. What are the other main options?\n\nAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThere are two main methods, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), and direct air capture (DAC). Capture-and-storage has gotten most of the attention so far, largely because it\u2019s been promoted by the fossil fuel industry as the thing that will solve its emissions problems. If you remember hearing the phrase \u201cclean coal,\u201d it was likely a reference to a CCS plant \u2013 or, more likely, an idea of one rather than something that actually existed.\u00a0\n\n4. How does CCS work?\n\nThink of a vacuum cleaner set on top of a smokestack. CCS involves collecting CO\u2082 as it\u2019s being emitted by a big source of pollution \u2013 by generators burning fossil fuel to make electricity or by factories or other industrial facilities \u2013 then sending it for use elsewhere or for storage deep underground. The technology dates to the 1970s, when oil companies in the US realized that pushing CO\u2082 into aging oil wells would allow them to squeeze out a bit of extra oil. They discovered that the carbon remained trapped in the surrounding rock. Then in the 1990s, as climate became more of a public concern, Norwegian oil giant Equinor ASA began sinking CO\u2082 in saline reservoirs so it could avoid paying a carbon tax. Ever since, CCS has been discussed as a way to limit the damage caused by fossil fuels without having to abandon them.\n\nAdvertisementStory continues below advertisement5. What\u2019s the challenge for CCS?\n\nThe cost. Since 2010, dozens of projects have been shelved because the technology was too expensive. After nearly 50 years of commercial use, there are only about 40 large-scale facilities that have CCS; altogether, they capture roughly 45 million tons of carbon annually, or about 0.1% of global emissions. CCS is also opposed by many climate activists. They say energy companies are using the prospect of CCS to slow the transition to an all-renewables economy. The group Friends of the Earth called the UK government\u2019s support for two CCS projects \u201can attempt to put a green gloss\u201d on a plan to grant hundreds of new licenses for oil and gas production in the North Sea.\n\n6. What\u2019s the case for CCS?\u00a0\n\nStory continues below advertisementSome stark climate math. Since some crucial industries such as steel and cement production rely on carbon-based chemical processes or temperatures that are hard to reach except by burning carbon, climate scientists and many governments, businesses and investors have come to assume that CCS will be an inevitable part of getting to zero.\n\nAdvertisement7. What is direct air capture?\n\nIf CCS is a vacuum cleaner on a smokestack, DAC is one set out in the open air. Cleaning up carbon this way is a much harder task: While nearly one-fifth of the gas going up a coal-burning plant\u2019s smokestack is carbon dioxide, the atmosphere is only about 0.04% carbon. Research labs and startups are developing competing DAC methods using a variety of chemical reactions. (One of carbon\u2019s notable characteristics is the ease with which it binds to other materials.) In some cases, the product is recycled for commercial purposes into such products as industrial chemicals or plastics. In others it\u2019s stored permanently beneath the ground, as with CCS.\n\nStory continues below advertisement8. What are the challenges for DAC?\u00a0\n\nShare this articleShareAgain, the industry is barely into infancy. Less than two dozen plants operate on a small scale. The largest, in Iceland, takes from the air and stores geologically about 4,000 tons of carbon annually. That\u2019s an amount equal only to the annual emissions of 250 average US citizens. And right now DAC is extremely expensive.\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement9. What\u2019s the US doing to advance carbon capture?\u00a0\n\n\u2022 The US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, aimed largely at promoting clean energy production domestically, increased the tax credit for CCS projects from $50 to $85 per ton of carbon. That\u2019s a level that CCS advocates are hopeful will lead to construction of capture facilities in industries such as power, cement, steel and petrochemicals. CCS is now \u201cpositioned to play an important role in decarbonizing the US economy,\u201d according to BloombergNEF.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\u2022 The same legislation lifted DAC tax credits from $50 to $180 a ton. An infrastructure law enacted in 2021 includes $3.5 billion to support DAC projects. In early August, the Energy Department announced it had selected two projects for the first tranche of funding, up to $1.2 billion. Once operational, the projects, planned for Texas and Louisiana, are expected to remove more than 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year from the atmosphere, the equivalent of taking nearly half a million gas-powered cars off the road, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said.\n\nAdvertisement10. What are others doing?\n\n\u2022 The EU in late 2021 set a goal of removing 5 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere annually by 2030. It was an early backer of Swiss startup Climeworks AG, which built the Iceland plant.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\u2022 In addition to supporting CCS projects, the UK government is spending 100 million pounds ($135 million) to support early-stage DAC technologies. It expects the technology will need to be scaled up in the late 2020s and early 2030s to help hit the country\u2019s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\u2022 Some companies are mobilizing on their own. Stripe, Google, JPMorgan and McKinsey and among the members of Frontier, a project that arranges the advance purchase of carbon removal credits from startup companies. The group in May pledged $53 million to Charm Industrial to remove 112,000 tons of carbon by 2030.\n\nAdvertisement11. Are there other methods of carbon capture?\n\nStory continues below advertisementYes, though none of them have yet been shown to be more practical than CCS or DAC, and some come with greater risks or unknowns.\n\n\u2022 Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS): First, plants are grown that absorb carbon. Then that biomass is burned to generate power. Those emissions are captured and buried, making for a carbon-negative power system. As with reforestation, massive amounts of high-quality land would be needed.\n\n\u2022 Soil carbon sequestration: Making changes to agricultural practices, including increased use of cover crops and restoration of grasslands, could increase the amount of carbon that\u2019s stored in the ground.\n\n\u2022 Enhanced weathering: Silicate minerals, such as basalt, absorb carbon when exposed to air. Some scientists have proposed that grinding such stones to powder and spreading it over large areas could speed that process. Crushing and spreading the stone may involve large outlays of energy, but increased crop yields could be a benefit.\n\nAdvertisement\u2022 Ocean fertilization: In theory, adding iron to ocean waters could promote the growth of plants that can absorb carbon and store it on the seabed. In practice, there have been worries about side effects and whether it would even work.\n\n\u2022 The International Energy Agency\u2019s website on carbon capture, and a report on its role in reaching net zero by 2050.\n\n\u2022 A Bloomberg News article on environmentalists\u2019 opposition to carbon capture provisions in the 2021 US infrastructure bill, and a letter from a group of scientists calling carbon capture an obstacle to a clean energy transition.\n\n\u2022 A Bloomberg News feature on the world\u2019s largest direct air capture plant, in Iceland.\n\nMore stories like this are available on [bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com)\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nShare CommentsLoading...Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.

The basic concept \u2013 that a reduction in carbon emissions or increase in carbon storage can compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere \u2013 sounds plausible, but successive scandals have plagued the market for years. Schemes have been accused of providing money to projects that would have gone ahead anyway, do not reduce carbon emissions, lead to an increase elsewhere, and damage local communities or biodiversity.\n\nMuch work is underway to rectify this. For example, [a raft of standards and guidance](https://icvcm.org/icvcm-and-vcmi-join-forces-to-operationalize-a-high-integrity-market-to-accelerate-global-climate-action/) is due this year, to define best practice and improve credibility in the use of carbon credits by companies. This kicked off in late June with [a code of practice](https://vcmintegrity.org/vcmi-claims-code-of-practice/) from the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) for businesses to follow when using and making claims about carbon credits as part of net-zero commitments.\n\nMonitoring tech leads the way\n-----------------------------\n\nMany believe one way to help fix offsets could be new technologies to digitise monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). This is a multi-stage process used to measure the amount of greenhouse gas emissions reduced or absorbed by a particular activity, such as reforestation, over a period of time. The findings are then reported to a third party to be verified so that carbon credits can be issued for trade on international carbon markets or used by corporations towards their net-zero targets.\n\nToday\u2019s conventional MRV techniques involve time-consuming manual processes and analogue data capture through in-person auditing of sites. Some digital technologies are already used, such as greenhouse gas inventory software, remote sensing and satellite positioning systems. But they comprise only around 10% of the process, according to a [report](https://www.goldstandard.org/our-story/digitising-mrv\"report) by a working group on the subject set up by Gold Standard, a carbon credit certification programme.\n\nDigital MRV would use various technologies \u2013 such as satellites and drones, artificial intelligence, blockchain encryption and \u201csmart sensors\u201d (which can analyse data, not just record it) \u2013 to automate data collection, analysis and validation, and provide more reliable and consistent data far more quickly. This will in turn reduce the costs and time associated with issuing new carbon credits.\n\nOne example, launched at last year\u2019s COP27 climate talks, is [CTrees](https://ctrees.org/), a nonprofit which claims to be the world\u2019s first-ever global system for accurately calculating the amount of carbon in every tree on the planet. It covers both carbon emissions and removals from all types of forests, at a resolution of one hectare \u2013 equivalent to just over one soccer pitch.\n\n\n> Our dataset observes everything\n\nDr Sassan Saatchi, NASA\u2019s\u00a0Jet Propulsion LaboratoryThe platform is built on AI-enabled satellite data, bringing near real-time data to buyers, project developers and regulators involved in carbon markets, as well as governments, the private sector and civil society.\n\nCTrees is led by Dr Sassan Saatchi, a senior scientist at\u00a0NASA\u2019s\u00a0Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a team of scientists and data engineers in the US, Brazil, Denmark and France. Supported by a combination of philanthropy and revenue from providing data products to partner nonprofits, it draws on more than 20 years of research and development by universities and space agencies worldwide.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEarly this year, CTrees started to provide operational data for project-level assessments of forest carbon. The fact that the dataset is global means it can track issues that have beset carbon markets for years \u2013 such as so-called \u201cleakage\u201d, where a policy or project designed to protect forests leads to deforestation shifting to another region, Saatchi says.\u00a0\n\n![low angle view of a spacecraft in a laboratory](https://dialogochino.net/content/uploads/2023/08/20230815_NISAR-flight-antenna-launch_NASA.jpg)A view of NISAR\u2019s flight antenna system. The radar technology used on the mission will image nearly all of Earth\u2019s land and ice masses, and the CTrees platform can integrate such data. (Image: [NASA](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/112/nisars-flight-antenna-system-undergoes-thermal-vacuum-testing-at-nasas-jet-propulsion-laboratory/))\u201cOur dataset observes everything \u2013 you can see easily if deforestation has gone up in the area, or 100 km away, or even in another jurisdiction, or another country. Social scientists and economists can use the data to really understand where the leakage is happening.\u201d\n\nCTrees\u00a0is to launch a free global alerts system for land-use change later this year that will produce notifications for activities like deforestation\u00a0or degradation every two weeks, increasing to every week starting in 2024. This will allow for faster interventions from governments, he explains, as\u00a0annual aggregations of carbon emissions and removals will provide policymakers with information that they can use to assess whether their programmes are generating the intended results.\n\nThe CTrees platform can integrate new data and science as it becomes available \u2013 for example, from the [NISAR](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/quick-facts/) mission, a joint Earth-observing project between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation due to launch next year. The radar technology used on that mission will image nearly all of Earth\u2019s land and ice masses, four to six times per month. Information on forest volume and biomass will be detailed enough to reveal changes on a human scale. The technology will halve the uncertainty associated with measuring the variability of changes in forest biomass, Saatchi says.\n\nBringing disparate data together\n--------------------------------\n\nAnother new digital platform, from the [Climate Action Data Trust](https://climateactiondata.org/) (CAD Trust), aims to link, aggregate and harmonise data from all major carbon registries, which may be run by governments or private companies. These registries track carbon projects, issue credits and record the ownership of offsets by giving each a serial number in order to mitigate the risk of double counting, where two organisations claim the same tonne of carbon removed.\n\nUntil it launches in the third quarter of this year, anyone wanting to cross-check registries for the same credit must do so manually, according to Yuvaraj Dinesh Babu, executive director of CAD Trust. This will only get more time-consuming as more countries set up registries and start to trade credits following the adoption of rules on international carbon trading at UN climate talks, he points out.\n\nCAD Trust\u2019s platform will provide a central place where anyone can check that credits are not being double counted \u2013 and, being run on blockchain technology, all actions that registries take on it will be auditable, he says.\n\nEventually, Babu hopes that all national carbon registries will be linked through the platform. It could then be used to prove what countries have achieved against their national climate strategies through the UN climate convention stocktaking process, a key part of the Paris Agreement through which countries assess what has been achieved against international climate targets, to help inform future action.\n\n![a satellite map of the amazonas](https://dialogochino.net/content/uploads/2023/08/20230815_Satellite-carbon-stock-CTrees_Screenshot_20230902.png)A screengrab from the CTrees portal showing the \u2018carbon density\u2019 of land in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, home to a large part of the Amazon rainforest. The darker the colour, the more CO2 stored per hectare of land. (Image: CTrees)Another carbon registry aggregation platform, [AlliedOffsets](https://alliedoffsets.com/), is also aiming to make it easier and quicker to find a variety of information, including what offset projects a particular company has bought credits from, whether they have bought the volume they say they have, and the quality of each project.\n\n\u201cWe realised how opaque the whole sector is [and] how poor information gathering was, and we started to ask questions such as why this one credit costs $2 and another $50, when they\u2019re supposedly for the same thing \u2013 a tonne of carbon. That seems insane,\u201d says Lars Kroijer, the firm\u2019s founder and managing director.\n\n\u201cWe aggregate all the ratings companies, the brokers, and the news sources so you can find everything in one place \u00ad\u2013 whether you\u2019re a buyer, a broker, a project developer or an academic,\u201d says Kroijer. \u201cIf someone wants to find all [the] nature-based solution projects in India, I could answer that question in three minutes. In the past, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019d start; it could take months.\u201d\n\nStandardising standards\n-----------------------\n\nGiven all these developments, offset certification bodies such as Gold Standard and Verra, as well as other organisations with an interest in carbon markets such as the World Bank, have been scrambling to assess, pilot and produce guidance, technologies and standards on digital MRV.\n\nVerra, which claims to be the world\u2019s largest carbon credits programme, is piloting a digital MRV platform that uses remote-sensing to measure forest carbon, provided by climate tech company Pachama.\n\nVerra says it will not be issuing credits using any data provided by the pilot, but rather will compare the digital system to its current approach in terms of accuracy, and assess if \u2013 and how \u2013 it could use the data. It will produce a document on its findings later this year for consultation with its stakeholders.\n\n[Benktesh Sharma](https://verra.org/staff/benktesh-sharma/), Verra\u2019s senior director of technology solutions, explains that current MRV methods mean reports sent by those carrying out a project for it to audit are inconsistent. \u201cThey have their own interpretation of how to use methodologies to come up with estimations of greenhouse gas reductions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut digital MRV will give us a standardised approach to handling this data, and we can check the data quality easily.\n\n\u201cIt will be shifting a mindset, from where you try to wrangle around various documents, to working on a digital interface. And users won\u2019t have to create a PDF document, or print a document and upload [it] into the system,\u201d he adds. \u201cRather, data will be moving from machine to machine.\u201d\n\nIn theory, digital systems will allow us to check the quality of data for a particular project, such as its location and how it was created. Incomplete or incorrect information would be flagged to Verra, according to [Rishi Das](https://verra.org/staff/rishi-das/), Verra\u2019s manager of technologies for natural climate solutions, who says that this should filter out any bad projects from its system. However, if malpractice is suspected in any project the programme has issued credits on, it will be far easier to scrutinise digital information rather than go through pages of PDFs provided by projects, he says.\n\nDemand for quality offsets in the voluntary carbon market outstrips supply, Sharma adds, and it currently takes many years from starting an offset project to the point where credits are issued. A more efficient, digital process could drastically reduce this timescale, meaning that carbon reduction projects could be scaled up much more quickly, he says.\n\nWhat are the downsides?\n-----------------------\n\nDigital MRV could save a lot of time, prevent human error, and improve transparency across the board, providing more companies and investors with confidence in voluntary carbon markets, acknowledges Ana Carolina Szklo, technical director of markets and standards at the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity initiative (VCMI). But she sees some disadvantages to digital MRV.\n\n\u201cDigital MRV such as satellite monitoring of forests is expensive, so we just have to be mindful that we don\u2019t exclude companies and developing countries that don\u2019t have the resources to promote and implement such modern technology systems,\u201d she says.\n\nTechnology doesn\u2019t solve all problems, she adds; it just flags up potential issues which would then need to be investigated with a physical visit to the site. For example, in Brazil, some images of forestry projects have captured other land-use changes. A satellite image on its own cannot prove if the project owner did it deliberately, or if fire could have been spread accidentally from a neighbouring area, she says.\n\n\n> It\u2019s easy to get up on your soapbox and yell, but the underlying solutions to climate change are sometimes technical\n\nLars Kroijer, Founder and managing director at AlliedOffsetsHuman auditors should also maintain a role in MRV systems, as their analysis of the data is very important, she stresses. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019re ready to just hand that all over to machines and technology, and not have any human brain capacity actually doing analysis behind all the data.\u201d\n\nMeeting targets for emissions reductions is not all about maths, she says. Some elements that need to be taken into account are subjective, such as the need for companies to have strong governance structures in place to be able to make good decisions on which projects in carbon markets to invest in.\n\n\u201cIt takes some time to process and disseminate technology to ensure that there\u2019s confidence behind everything, so that investors can bring resources, and the private sector can implement projects,\u201d she says, adding that many of these technologies have to go through a pilot phase.\n\nKroijer is optimistic that digital MRV can be part of the solution to overcoming scepticism to carbon markets. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get up on your soapbox and yell, but the underlying solutions to climate change are sometimes technical, and they need to be worked out over a long period of time,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s a lot of bad in this space, but find me any space with 25,000 projects where there isn\u2019t a flaw.\u201d\n\n*This article was originally published on\u00a0[China Dialogue](https://chinadialogue.net/en/business/can-new-tech-make-carbon-offsets-trustworthy/).*\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Carbon offsets have been plagued by scandals and reputational issues, but new technologies such as digitizing monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) processes could help improve credibility and efficiency.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article presents both the potential benefits and downsides of using digital MRV technologies, without expressing a strong positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "CTrees, a nonprofit organization led by NASA's Dr. Sassan Saatchi, is using AI-enabled satellite data to create a global system that accurately calculates carbon levels in every tree on the planet.

Both are the subject of increasing interest from investment firms.\n\n\nFor example, Pimco features a small allocation to carbon credits in its Pimco Commodity Real Return\u00a0[PCRIX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/pcrix/quote), and KraneShares offers KraneShares Global Carbon Offset ETF\u00a0[KSET](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/report/etf/performance.aspx?t=0P0001O799&lang=en-CA). Both funds argue investments in carbon may allow ordinary investors to benefit financially from decarbonisation efforts.\n\n\nEven so, carbon credits and carbon offsets are fundamentally different, with implications for investors seeking to understand how these instruments work in practice.\n\n\nIt starts with the philosophical problems that each security is trying to tackle. Carbon offsets are designed to help consumers counteract the impact of expected or past emissions.\n\n\nCarbon credits, meanwhile, make it more expensive for companies in regulated industries to pollute by charging them per unit of carbon they emit, which has the effect of disincentivizing future emissions.\n\n\nKey Differences Between Carbon Credits and Carbon Offsets\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![A table comparing and contrasting carbon credits and carbon offsets.](https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/FjoTXCsjra6MWiaIJhi9XYjslGM=/1600x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/LPP4YRRCJJF4JDIY3Z63NII6UU.png)\n\n\nAnother way to think about it is that carbon offsets are not unlike the\u00a0[indulgences of medieval Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence), in the sense that people buy them in order to atone for their environmental sins. Meanwhile, carbon credits are more like a toll on an expressway: A government may actually require companies to pay in order to emit, and carbon credits are the fare they pay for the right to do so.\n\n\nHow Does Carbon Pricing Work?\n-----------------------------\n\n\nFundamentally, carbon offsets and carbon credits answer two different questions. Offsets serve as a proxy for how much people are\u00a0*willing*\u00a0to pay to defray the environmental cost of their activities. Meanwhile, carbon credits address the question of how much businesses are\u00a0*able*\u00a0to pay to keep operating.\n\n\nCarbon offsets measure people's (and companies') willingness to pay for their own personal carbon footprint by pricing the cost of offsetting activities. These offsetting activities fall into two categories: avoidance, which can happen through things like stripping methane from a landfill, or removal, which generally happens through planting trees. Because offsetting activities differ depending on the program, carbon offsets themselves are heterogeneous, and prices tend to vary based on the activity they finance and the quality of the program.\n\n\nMeanwhile, carbon credits track companies' ability to pay for their operations if their emissions exceed preset limits. Because participation is required by law in most cases, the market for carbon credits is much bigger than the market for carbon offsets. This holds true in spite of the fact that offsets are more well-known. \n\n\nWhy is this? Certain businesses have to purchase carbon credits, whereas in most cases the choice to purchase an offset is purely voluntary. Consequently, according to the World Bank, carbon credits regulate around 18% of the world\u2019s emissions, while carbon offsets track far less than 1%.  \n\n\n\nCarbon Credits Market Dwarfs Carbon Offsets\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n![A graph displaying the amount of carbon represented by the carbon credit market as opposed to the carbon offset market.](https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/0mQVR9oju931djM_XnZ-rsZicOc=/1600x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/NBARW5FB4RFQFBXBMX5QGFKH7I.png)\n\n\nParticipation in the carbon credit markets is enforced through a special type of program called a \"cap-and-trade\" programme. The cap-and-trade programme mandates that businesses in specified sectors keep carbon emissions under a particular ceiling, called a \"cap.\" Firms that pollute less than their limit can \"trade\" their excess carbon on the open market. A carbon credit is the security that is created when a company opts to trade its extra carbon. The European Union has the oldest and largest market, but other places like California and China have them, too.\n\n\nMore Importantly,\u00a0*Does*\u00a0Carbon Pricing Work?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nDespite the depth and sophistication of these markets, there is still a lot of daylight between what carbon pricing programs aim to do and what they can feasibly accomplish.\n\n\nWhile awareness of carbon offsets has increased in recent years, participation in carbon offsetting remains\u00a0[muted](https://www.morningstar.com/sustainable-investing/when-it-comes-air-travel-sustainability-flyers-arent-walking-walk). The biggest audience for carbon offsets today is consumers, and for consumers other considerations like price and convenience tend to outweigh the environmental impact of the purchase they\u2019re about to make.\n\n\nThe chief issue plaguing cap-and-trade programs is that governments set the annual emissions caps a few years in advance. In doing so, regulators project how much they expect certain sectors will pollute in a given year. Our research finds most of these covered sectors are reducing emissions faster than government forecasts, which is a good thing. But when companies beat expectations, it leads to a glut of credits on the market, and that means carbon is cheap to trade.\n\n\nIn fact, carbon-linked securities don't charge enough of an economic penalty to directly assist in meeting climate agreements. Economists suggest that the price of carbon needed to meet the\u00a0[Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement)\u00a0is somewhere above $50 per tonne. As of 2023, no carbon offsets command a premium that high, and just four carbon credits across the 36 markets that we cover cost more than that.\n\n\nCarbon Credits Charge More Per Tonne of Carbon\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n![A bar chart showing the difference in prices between carbon offsets and carbon credits.](https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/a2xgg8ap44YuzRDLSIS2IBIo9P0=/1600x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/P4X3WCEDNREJLKPA5GB6HUM6SQ.png)\n\n\nWhat Are the Takeaways For Investors?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nAlthough they are very different, what carbon credits and offsets do have in common is neither carbon offsets nor carbon credits charge a price that could be considered punitive, and there\u2019s no guarantee that they ever will. Proponents of an allocation to carbon-linked securities argue that carbon securities are a \"sure thing\" because, conceptually, the price of carbon\u00a0*has*\u00a0to rise in order to meet climate agreements.\u00a0\n\n\nBut this conclusion rests on the assumption that the price of carbon\u00a0*can*\u00a0rise.\n\n\nFor carbon offsets, that assumption can only hold true if people (and companies) have the appetite and resources to follow through on their self-imposed commitments. For carbon credits, a similar principle applies, but it's a question of political willpower: for these programmes to produce consistent price signals, governments need to set the right standard and stick to it even when it's unpopular.\n\n\nOur research finds that, in most cases, regulators are a little better at it than individuals and companies, but not much. The sectors regulated under cap-and-trade programs have generally cut emissions faster than government forecasts, resulting in cheap carbon[.](https://morningstar.arcpublishing.com/composer/#_msocom_3)\n\n\nCarbon offsets and carbon credits obey fundamentally different principles. Importantly, carbon credits are creatures of regulation, and regulators can create a market and scale it much faster than individuals can. However, it also means that the price of carbon credits depends on the effectiveness of regulators at following through on their aims once those markets go live. Ultimately, though, investors' success in either security depends on the outcomes of carbon markets rather than the intrinsic value of carbon itself.\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Carbon offsets and carbon credits are different instruments, with carbon offsets helping consumers counteract the impact of emissions, while carbon credits make it more expensive for companies to pollute.

Disruption risk looms over global LNG, European gas prices\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/52b59f93-1b24-49b3-9c95-414e24ed6025.svg)\n\n\n\n\n**What's happening?** Workers at Australia's Gorgon, Wheatstone and North West Shelf LNG projects are threatening to go on strike due to disagreements over pay and working conditions. Gas companies Woodside and Chevron have been in talks with the workers unions to address their concerns. The three LNG terminals have a total LNG export capacity of around 41 million mt/year that equals to around 10%-11% of global LNG supply. The news has already [sent European TTF gas prices and Asian spot LNG prices higher](https://platform.platts.spglobal.com/web/client?auth=inherit#platts/insightsArticle?articleID=b7281d2e-e08b-462f-92a9-2666a0644050) as a disruption could coincide with the early winter restocking season, when Europe competes with Asia for LNG supplies.\n\n\n\n**What's next?** Australian union workers have about 10 working days from Aug. 11 to vote on a regulatory order allowing industrial action. However, it remains to be seen whether the strike will actually proceed and whether gas production will be impacted as companies have a number of contingency plans in place. S&P Global Commodity Insights analyst Logan Reese said any potential industrial action will occur in a phased manner and market participants said LNG buyers have not been notified of expected disruptions by their suppliers. The situation remains fluid.\n\n\n### 2. Food & Beverage Price Index spikes in July amid extreme weather\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/0921bf3e-d443-4d3b-a87c-928f6e3abef2.svg)\n\n\n\n\n**What's happening?** The S&P Global Commodity Insights [Food & Beverage Price Index rose for the first time since February](https://connect.ihsmarkit.com/document/show/phoenix/4819855?connectPath=Search&searchSessionId=8315d0b3-b140-4eb8-8148-500105d6c9a0), increasing by 5 points month-on-month to 113.5 points in July. While the end of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the Indian government's decision to ban non-Basmati white rice exports inevitably played a role in the spike, extreme or erratic weather throughout much of the world proved to be a more significant reason behind the price rises, including El Nino-affected cocoa production in West Africa and heat wave-stricken vegetable output in Southern Europe.\n\n\n\n**What's next?** Both the extreme weather and political decisions in July are still being digested by agricultural markets so far in August. However, all signs so far this month point towards even higher prices, with further increases to the Food & Beverage Price Index later this year also likely amid persistent output concerns and impediments to trade.\n\n\n### 3. Compliance carbon prices reach all-new high in China, slip to record low in South Korea\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/53e9f441-6bc7-4898-bf0b-a880def2cacb.svg)\n\n\n\n\n**What's happening?** The daily weighted average price of China's compliance emission allowances, or CEAs, reached a record high at Yuan 69.90/mtCO2e ($9.76/mtCO2e) on Aug. 11. On the other hand, South Korea's emission trading scheme, the most mature compliance market in Asia-Pacific, saw a record-low clearing price at Won 8,180/mtCO2e ($6.20/mt) in the August monthly auction for the 2023 allowance units, called KAU23. The recent price surge and demand growth in China were driven by enhanced policy clarity. In mid-July, the government announced trading rules for the compliance period ending Dec. 31, with tightened measures to pursue a 100% compliance rate. In South Korea, the oversupply of free allowances resulted in little incentive for compliance entities to pick up the units in the market, translating into low liquidity and collapsed prices.\n\n\n\n**What's next?** China and South Korea have both relaxed supply of emissions allowances for the current compliance period to help relieve companies' financial burdens on top of soaring fuel prices and a downturn in the economy. The price surge in China may be expected to continue only if companies remain enthusiastic to participate in the market, instead of approaching other non-market options like submitting unused CEAs left from the last compliance period, or advancing CEAs from the next compliance period, both of which are allowed under this year's policy. In South Korea, a price rebound would depend on whether the government will further intervene and set stronger market stabilization measures.\n\n\n### 4. Argentina's lithium production could more than triple by 2030\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/56a86802-8a4e-4f60-992c-b8de17c192f7.svg)\n\n\n\n\n**What's happening?** Argentina, Chile and Bolivia together hold 50% of the world's mineral resources. Bolivia has invested roughly $800 million in its strictly controlled salt flats, with a grid of ponds and an unfinished plant that it said will begin producing 15,000 mt/year of lithium carbonate equivalent this year. Chilean lithium operations are centralized to industry giants SQM and Albemarle, with no large expansion plans in the pipeline, and recently revealed plans for a state-led public-private model -- spooking additional investors. Argentina has over 30 mining projects in different stages and has largely been driven by private investments and regular permit approvals as the government looked to bring in more US dollars through mining exports.\n\n\n\n**What's next?** Argentina currently produces 40,000 mt of lithium carbonate. With the country's current project pipeline, the implementation of direct-lithium-extraction technologies and by addressing infrastructure bottlenecks could [drive Argentina's end-2023 lithium production](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/081423-argentina-could-be-epicenter-of-new-stage-of-lithium-supply) by at least 50%. There are at least four new projects that are expected to start up in Q1 2024, which could drive production to reach 120,000 mt.\n\n\n### 5. Iranian crude imports to China's independent refineries rise on competitive prices\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/90372db1-24b8-4f6f-a4a0-c4817eeef386.svg)\n\n\n\n\n**What's happening?** China's independent refineries imported around 6.28 million mt of Iranian crudes in July, up 13% from June and the highest so far this year. Sources said Iranian Light was currently offered at a discount of around $13-$13.5/b, against the ICE Brent Futures on a delivered basis in Shandong market, while Iranian Heavy could be even lower at a discount of around $18-$19/b on the same basis. Russian crudes, on the other hand, are losing their attractiveness to this market due to their rising prices.\n\n\n\n**What's next?** Traders and refinery sources expect China's independent refineries to continue shifting away from Russian crudes while at the same time [increasing their imports of Iranian crudes](https://platform.platts.spglobal.com/web/client?auth=inherit#platts/insightsArticle?articleID=5addb9a8-527d-486d-afff-379b000bae40) this month. Sources said there is sufficient supply of Iranian crudes in the market available to the independent refineries.\n\n\n### 6. Europe DRI steelmaking costs via green hydrogen remain high\n\n\n\n![](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/PlattsContent/_assets/_images/latest-news/b9fe22b7-cc94-4c5a-bb17-990f278321bd.svg)\n\n\n\n\n**What's happening?** European lower-emissions steelmaking costs using direct-reduced iron and hydrogen remain high compared with ferrous scrap and blast furnace-based pig iron input costs. Spreads between pig iron and green hydrogen DRI using electrolyzers and renewable power, have narrowed after peaking in August 2022. After a decline in natural gas prices, DRI using gas regained competitiveness this year. DRI costs using blue hydrogen with carbon capture and storage remain lower than using green hydrogen, while still being significantly higher than conventional scrap-based electric arc furnaces and pig iron.\n\n\n\n**What's next?** Hydrogen-based steel costs in Europe may become more competitive with long-term energy contracts and subsidies to help offset new electrolyzers, steel plants and related investments. Steelmakers expect the higher production costs of lower emissions steel to be met by firmer prices and demand for certified steel.

The non-profit initiative [Ecosystem Marketplace](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/the-art-of-integrity-state-of-the-voluntary-carbon-markets-q3-2022/) painted an optimistic picture for 2022 in its annual \u201cState of the Voluntary Carbon Markets\u201d report, as carbon prices trended upwards.\n\n\nIn 2021, carbon prices soared to a global average of US$4 per tonne \u2013 a value not seen since 2013 \u2013 driven largely by rising prices for nature-based credits, which often trade at a premium due to the additional non-carbon benefits they bring, such as local community development and biodiversity conservation.\n\n\nHowever, since its peak at the start of 2022, the price of nature-based offsets has slumped by over 90 per cent, to US$1.82 at the time of publication,\u00a0coinciding with macroeconomic headwinds and media reports that have called into question the environmental claims surrounding\u00a0certified rainforest credits, which are used by notable international corporations.\n\n\n![NGEO Prices 2022 to 2023](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/ngeo_prices_falling_2022_to_2023.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nNature-based Global Emissions Offsets (N-GEO), or carbon credits generated by projects that reduce, remove, or prevent carbon emissions through nature-based solutions, were trading at a premium over other offsets in the voluntary carbon market in 2022. However, their prices have since plummeted. Source: CarbonCredits.com\n\n\n\nCriticisms of REDD+ are not new.\u00a0As a type of avoidance carbon credits, which focus on preventing greenhouse gas emissions that would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere, most observers have pointed to how REDD+ offsets can never perfectly predict long-term emission reductions.\u00a0\n\n\nCharles Bedford, chief impact officer of the global carbon markets investing firm Carbon Growth Partners, shares this sentiment. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to pick fights in the carbon market because all carbon projects are based upon a prediction about the future, and all predictions about the future are wrong. It\u2019s just about how much.\u201d\n\n\nBefore becoming a carbon markets investor, Bedford was the Asia Pacific managing director of The Nature Conservancy, a global non-profit conservation group. He left The Nature Conservancy\u00a0to start Carbon Growth Partners in 2021, with the aim of unlocking more funding for nature conservation and restoration projects \u2013 traditionally the realm of philanthropic causes \u2013 while generating financial returns for investors.\n\n\nHaving worked on conservation solutions, including market-based solutions, for over two decades, Bedford has seen the carbon offsets market develop since its infancy. He believes that REDD+ projects remain the best bet for incentivising developing countries with significant forest cover \u2013 which tend to be nations with low governance, as Bedford points out \u2013 to prevent deforestation.\n\n\n\u201cNot cutting down a forest means forgoing income from harvesting timber. So if we don\u2019t figure out a way to replace the income that poor countries can get from harvesting the forest, then they will harvest the forest,\u201d Bedford said.\n\n\nUnder the REDD+ framework, developing countries can receive results-based payment for reducing emissions from deforestation. But there have been controversies around how the financial incentives and benefit-sharing mechanisms are structured in these projects, and how consent is obtained from [Indigenous peoples](https://www.eco-business.com/news/tag/indigenous-peoples/) and local communities that own the land.\n\n\nFor these reasons, it takes \u201ca lot of effort\u201d to get comfortable with such projects. \u201cWe believe in REDD+, but it takes a fair bit of due diligence to be comfortable with REDD+ projects, so we\u2019ve only invested in a few of them,\u201d Bedford shared with Eco-Business on a trip to Cambodia\u2019s Keo Seima and Southern Cardamom REDD+ projects that several media outlets were invited to.\n\n\n![Mountain of confiscated chainsaws](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/DSC_0854.jpg?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nCharles Bedford (middle) looking at a pile of over 6,000 confiscated chainsaws amassed from the last decade at the Sre Ambel Patrol Station within the Southern Cardamom REDD+ project. Image: Eco-Business/Gabrielle See\n\n\n\nBedford said his firm has done \u201cshallow\u201d due diligence on all 30 REDD+ projects that have issued considerable credits, and \u201cdeep\u201d due diligence on the top ten projects**,** which account for about 90 per cent of these issued credits. To date, Carbon Growth Partners has only invested in REDD+ projects in Asia and Latin America, like Cambodia\u2019s Keo Seima and Colombia\u2019s Selva de Matav\u00e9n, but is starting to look at Africa after a recent hire there.\n\n\nAmid the market turbulence last year, the firm\u2019s original fund, Carbon Growth Opportunities Fund, outperformed other benchmarks like the global derivatives marketplace CME Group\u2019s Nature-based Global Emissions Offsets (N-GEO) and GEO. The investment manager has attributed this performance to its focus on high-quality carbon assets and diversified portfolio.\n\n\nIn terms of project type, the fund was less exposed to REDD+ and non-CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) renewables, and more exposed to blue carbon and cookstoves, which held up better in value compared to the first two project types last year.\n\n\nAs the VCM seeks to restore trust, \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d have become the latest buzzwords among industry players. For this reason, numerous guides for companies looking to buy credible forest carbon offsets have also been freshly penned this year by the [World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)](https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy/Climate/Natural-Climate-Solutions/The-Natural-Climate-Solutions-Alliance/Resources/A-Buyer-s-Guide-to-Natural-Climate-Solutions-Carbon-Credits) and [eight conservation and Indigenous organisations](https://tfciguide.org/).\n\n\nBedford ran Eco-Business through a checklist his firm uses to \u201cgo deeper\u201d into the quality of REDD+ projects, once basic due diligence, such as verifying credentials of the project on a trusted registry and assessing counterparty risks, has been done.\n\n\n#### The three factors he looks out for in REDD+ offsets:\n\n\n**1. A conservative baseline**\n\n\nThere are two main components in a conservative baseline, Bedford said. First, the deforestation rate in the country must not be overestimated at the time of assessment. Second, the deforestation rate for the country where the project is located must not go below what was estimated. For instance, if the deforestation rate for a country was conservatively estimated at 1 per cent but turned out to be 2 per cent after a decade, the project is theoretically generating credits twice as good as it claimed.\n\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest carbon credits certifier Verra recently updated its [new consolidated methodology](https://verra.org/verra-reaches-key-milestones-in-finalizing-new-redd-methodology/), which uses a jurisdictional allocation approach to determine project baselines so that\u00a0projects no longer have to rely on a reference region \u2013 or a nearby area with similar drivers of deforestation \u2013 to project future deforestation. Project baselines are also now re-assessed every six years instead of ten.\n\n\nProject design documents (PDDs) typically have 60 to 70 pages dedicated to complex calculations of the baseline emissions and carbon stocks within the project, which is particularly important in the avoided deforestation world.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a REDD+ problem,\u201d said Bedford, who added that a conservative baseline is also important in other project types like cookstoves and renewable energy, \u201cBut it\u2019s a REDD+ problem because it\u2019s just a little harder to make predictions about the future and be right about them.\u201d\n\n\nCarbon Growth Partners outsources the work of poring over PDDs and cross-checking the historical data cited in them to third party vendors with skill sets in remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) analysis in forestry.\n\n\nRating agencies, like Sylvera, offer subscription access to baseline estimations, which Carbon Growth Partners also uses. \u201cThat gives us an easy first step and if we feel like we need to get deeper, then we\u2019ll hire somebody to go even deeper,\u201d said Bedford. \u201cOften, the big buyers in the corporate sector will use rating agencies as a surrogate to do the hard due diligence for them.\u201d\n\n\n![Jahoo camp biodiversity monitoring](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/carbon_surveying.JPG?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nA staff from the Jahoo Gibbon Camp, a sustainable ecotourism\u00a0camp\u00a0within the Keo Seima REDD+ project, conducting a maintenance check on an arboreal camera trap, which contributes to the biodiversity monitoring at the site. Image: Eco-Business/Gabrielle See\n\n\n\nBedford emphasised that his firm is \u201cnot dependent\u201d on rating agencies. They are either employed as upfront screening tools to weed out poorly rated REDD+ projects, or from a defensive perspective, to keep up to date with rating changes for projects it owns, in case the changes affect the market value of these projects.\n\n\n**2.\u00a0Strong implementation capacity**\n\n\nPotential buyers should look at the track record and experience of project developers, who are non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or private companies, to assess how well they can implement projects with rural communities in low governance countries.\n\n\nWhile most of this due diligence can be done online, Bedford said that he prefers to meet project developers and partners where the project is located, so they can walk him through it. For this reason, Bedford visited Cambodia\u2019s Keo Seima REDD+ project, which is supported by the international conservation NGO Wildlife Conservation Society, before investing in it. He is also considering investing in the Southern Cardamom REDD+ project which he visited.\n\n\nAs of 19 June, Verra has opened up a\u00a0review of the Southern Cardamom project on the back of allegations of rights abuses by the NGO Human Rights Watch. The project is suspended from any new credit issuances while the investigation is ongoing.\n\n\n**3.\u00a0Ownership of the project by\u00a0Indigenous peoples and local communities**\n\n\nFor more qualitative aspects of the project, like its ownership by\u00a0Indigenous peoples and local communities, Bedford said the company would send independent people on the ground to assess them. These people will need to be knowledgeable about the country, the local contexts, and what a good development project looks like.\n\n\nThe issue of ownership concerns both figurative buy-in from the communities \u2013 determined by speaking to people on site \u2013 as well as literal ownership, around deal structure and funds flow. \u201cThe traceability of funds from the retiree [of the carbon credit] back down to where and how much is spent on the ground is important both from a project success and equity perspective,\u201d said Bedford.\n\n\n[![Keo Seima Funds](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/Keo_Seima_Funds.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/Keo_Seima_Funds.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&q=45&w=2000)\nA flowchart showing how the Keo Seima REDD+ revenue feeds back into government, project, and community funding. Source: WCS Cambodia\n\n\n\n#### Additional factors:\n\n\n**1. Country risk**\n\n\nA country can have high sovereign risk, which is\u00a0the risk of a government defaulting on its debt,\u00a0but potentially still carry less risk of reversal in emissions avoidance. Bedford cited the example of Cambodia, which has relatively high economic and political risks, but generally \u201cscores well\u201d in his view for REDD+ projects due to its commitment to the REDD+ model, as well as the clarity around its nationally determined contribution (NDC) and the financing needed to achieve it.\n\n\n**2. Implementation risk**\n\n\nThis refers to how well partners can execute the project on the ground, which depends on their experience, political connections, and sensitivity to local communities.\n\n\n**3.\u00a0Reputational risk**\n\n\nThis concerns the benefit sharing agreement of projects and the values of the partners, which Bedford prefers to assess by visiting them in person on the ground. Such site visits helps him to get to know who they are and how they think about the project, as well as their reputation on the ground, said Bedford.\n\n\n*Media access to the sponsored trip to Cambodia\u2019s Southern Cardamom and Keo Seima REDD+ projects was facilitated by Everland.*\n\n\n*Read more about the complex dynamics behind REDD+ projects in Cambodia in [this special report](https://www.eco-business.com/news/behind-cambodias-big-bet-on-redd-projects/).*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### \n Did you find this article useful?

Carbon Sync is leading a soil carbon sequestration pilot project involving up to 80,000 hectares of the region\u2019s cropping and grazing region. The project is Chevron\u2019s first nature-based carbon offset project in the country, the company said in a news release Friday.\n\n\n\u201cI am thrilled that a large multinational organization has recognized the potential of Carbon Sync to change the carbon equation for WA\u2019s agricultural industry, as well as create jobs and further investment for our state\u201d, Carbon Sync Founder and CEO Louise Edmonds said. \u201cThrough these pilot projects, we aim to enhance the sustainability of WA\u2019s agricultural sector and improve biodiversity outcomes\".\n\n\nChevron has also joined a multiyear research project with Deakin University\u2019s Blue Carbon Lab to explore potential carbon dioxide sequestration opportunities in the region\u2019s coastal wetlands. The Blue Carbon Lab offers \u201cinnovative research solutions aiding to help mitigate climate change and enhance our blue economy, while simultaneously supporting aquatic biodiversity, economic growth, capacity building, and community wellbeing\u201d, according to the news release.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been great mystery into the size of WA\u2019s blue carbon assets and the potential for new blue carbon opportunities through the conservation and restoration of coastal wetlands. This research project seeks to address this knowledge gap\u201d, Blue Carbon Lab Director and Professor Peter Macreadie said.\n\n\n\u201cThe two projects we are part of in WA are examples of the multiple pathways on that lower carbon journey\u201d, Chevron Australia General Manager for Energy Transition David Fallon said. \u201cOur collaboration with Carbon Sync is expected to provide critical insights related to soil carbon projects, in a region with large potential for scale to help meet the forecasted demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units\".\n\n\n\u201cWith the Blue Carbon Lab contribution, we are excited to explore the opportunities for blue carbon in WA\u2019s saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass environments\u201d, Fallon added.\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that the future of energy is lower carbon\u201d, Chevron New Energies Vice President of Offsets and Emerging Barbara Harrison said. \u201cAustralia is not only an essential part of Chevron\u2019s established portfolio, but we also see tremendous potential to develop businesses that help achieve our lower carbon aspirations\".\n\n\n**Thevenard\u00a0Island Decommissioning Completed**\n\n\nIn an earlier news release, Chevron Australia said it has completed onshore decommissioning work at Thevenard Island, \u201cmarking a significant milestone for Western Australia\u2019s emerging decommissioning industry\u201d.\n\n\nThe Chevron-operated Thevenard Island Joint Venture oil and gas facility, located around 13.7 miles (22 kilometers) from Onslow, produced approximately 150 million barrels of oil over its 25-year lifespan until 2014. The area will be returned to the WA Government once it is restored to a condition similar to and compatible with the adjacent environment, Chevron said.\n\n\nChevron Australia said the decommissioning process involved the plugging of 11 onshore production wells, three water disposal wells, one exploration well and the safe dismantling and removal of three 150,000-barrel oil storage tanks in addition to production tanks, separator vessels, flowlines, associated process infrastructure and ancillary accommodation facilities and utilities including the controlled toppling of the 124.7-foot (38-meter) communications tower. In total, the project resulted in the removal of more than 5,000 metric tons of scrap metal from the island for recycling.\u00a0\n\n\nMeanwhile, the decommissioning of the Chevron Australia-operated Barrow Island Joint Venture oil facility and associated infrastructure on Barrow Island is expected to start in 2025.\n\n\nChevron Australia\u2019s Director of Operations Danny Woodall said that decommissioning is a growing industry that provides economic opportunities as assets enter the later stages of their lifecycles. \u201cDecommissioning is an enormous economic opportunity that will grow as existing assets enter the later stages of their lifecycles\u201d, Woodall said.\n\n\n\u201cThe Thevenard Island Retirement Project is an example of Chevron\u2019s commitment to progressing decommissioning and rehabilitation activities in a systematic and timely manner to deliver positive outcomes for the environment and local community,\u201d Chevron Australia\u2019s Thevenard Island Retirement Project Manager Chris Jones said.\n\n\nLiberty Industrial\u2019s General Manager Barry Crossey added that the Thevenard Island project \u201cset a new benchmark for transforming end-of-life sites into rehabilitated areas, that can be carried through to future projects in the region and further afield\u201d.\n\n\nChevron Australia engaged several contractors including Liberty Industrial, AGC, Bhagwan Marine, TAMS Group, Golder Associates, and Astron Environmental Services to assist with the decommissioning process, according to the release.\n\n\n*To contact the author, email rteodoro.editor@outlook.com*\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Chevron is investing in two lower carbon projects in Western Australia.

President Biden needs to run, not walk, away from the climate catastrophe of fossil fuels. Every time his administration approves another oil or gas project, it pushes us toward a more hellish future. Biden should use all his executive powers to speed the end of the fossil fuel era, because every tenth of a degree matters. Unless he does, these projects will perpetuate human suffering, environmental racism, and wildlife extinction. They\u2019ll just keep on cooking the planet.\u201d\n\nThe IRA failed to directly curb oil, gas and coal, which make up 85% of climate-heating pollution. Even if every renewable incentive in the Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion package [works perfectly](https://rhg.com/research/climate-clean-energy-inflation-reduction-act/), in tandem with existing measures the law will not meet Biden's commitment to cut carbon pollution 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Biden\u2019s use of executive powers to curb fossil fuels directly can make up this gap.\n\nThe IRA fails to stop U.S. exports of fossil fuels abroad. The United States is the leading exporter of oil and gas around the world. That production perpetuates pollution and environmental racism in communities at the site of extraction and export. The combustion abroad of U.S. fossil fuels also increases global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe Act also contained several fossil fuel poison pills, including new oil and gas leasing mandates and credits for dangerous and unproven technologies like carbon capture and storage. The IRA deal was struck with a promise to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) to greenlight the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which [passed](https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/debt-ceiling-deal-stains-bidens-legacy-on-climate-environmental-justice-2023-06-01/) in June.\n\nUnder Biden\u2019s [ordinary executive powers](https://climatepresident.org/Legal-Authority-for-Presidential-Climate-Action.pdf) and [emergency executive powers](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/energy-justice/pdfs/Climate-Emergency-Powers-Report.pdf), he can:\n\n* Curb fossil fuel production where the Inflation Reduction Act did not, including stopping all approvals of [new oil and gas projects](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/pdfs/Maritime-Administration-climate-petition-2022-11-10.pdf?_gl=1*10cnd9w*_gcl_au*MTIzNjQ3Nzg1NC4xNjgyMjgyNjMz), [phasing out](https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/biden-administration-rejects-calls-to-phase-out-oil-gas-on-public-lands-by-2035-2023-06-29/?_gl=1*1ng2gzb*_gcl_au*MTQ4NDgyMjg4MS4xNjg5NjIwMTEz) the production of oil, gas and coal on our public lands and waters, and halting fossil fuel exports.\n* Stop the hundreds of billions of dollars in public and private finance for fossil fuel projects abroad through his powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n* Direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies to deploy distributed energy systems, like community and rooftop solar, with post-disaster funds and IRA financing to maximize resilient and affordable clean energy systems.\n* Declare heat as a major disaster event under the Stafford Act. This will allow states to access more heat-relief funds for things like cooling and water centers in areas accessible to those most affected by heat, including poor and unhoused people, as well as agricultural and other workers.\n\nOn Sept. 17 thousands of people will participate in the [March to End Fossil Fuels](https://www.endfossilfuels.us/), urging Biden to declare a climate emergency and use all his executive powers to speed the end of the fossil fuel era. The New York City march is part of a [mass global escalation to end fossil fuels](https://fightfossilfuels.net/), with mobilizations occurring around the world on Sept. 15.\n\nThe mass mobilizations support the U.N.

The second site, the South Texas DAC Hub, is slated for Kleberg County.\n\nThe $1.2 billion in federal funding for the projects represents the largest investment in engineered carbon removal to date, with each hub expected to remove more than 250 times more carbon dioxide than the largest facility currently in operation, according to the Department of Energy.\n\nIn total, both projects are expected to remove 2 million metric tons of CO2, equivalent to the annual emissions of roughly 450,000 gasoline vehicles. The DOE cites estimates that the Biden administration's plan to reach net-zero emissions will require between 400 million and 1.8 billion metric tons of CO2 removed from the atmosphere annually by 2050.\n\n\"Cutting back on our carbon emissions alone won't reverse the growing impacts of climate change; we also need to remove the CO2 that we've already put in the atmosphere\u2014which nearly every climate model makes clear is essential to achieving a net-zero global economy by 2050,\" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards contends the state's \"talented energy workforce and embrace of lower carbon technologies make us the perfect fit for innovative projects like this Direct Air Capture Hub.\"\n\n\"Louisiana's climate action plan has positioned us as a leader in the global energy transition, and this major announcement will create thousands of good-paying jobs while lowering the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement comes as 39 Republican senators including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy have signed on to a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan to spell out their objections to Clean Power Plan 2.0 proposed in May to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants for the first time.\n\nThe letter says the plan violates the Clean Air Act by imposing carbon capture technologies that have not been \"adequately demonstrated,\" and would require fuel switching in conflict with the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA.\n\nThat ruling struck down the initial Clean Power Plan, pushed by the Obama administration in 2015, to set limits on carbon from power plants, finding the EPA lacked authority to implement the plan without congressional approval.\n\nThe proposed Clean Power Plan 2.0 would require coal and natural gas plants to \"co-fire\" with 30% clean hydrogen in 2032 and ramp up to 96% by 2038, and to operate carbon capture technology with a 90% carbon dioxide capture rate by 2030.\n\n\"This proposed rule will drastically increase costs and reduce electricity supplies,\" senators wrote. \"These effects will not only be borne by the regulated community, but by every American, manufacturer, and small business that relies on the electricity grid.\"\n\nThe plan, coupled with the EPA's Electric Generating Unit Strategy, is \"a way to shutter fossil-fuel power plants and bolster President Biden's climate goals,\" senators wrote.\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The U.S. Department of

Decarbonization Strategies Ahead of COP28 - Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University SIPA | CGEP %", "content": "\nThe 28th edition of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) that opens in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), on November 30 has brought the usual flurry of diplomatic preparation\u2014heightened this year by a surge in global temperatures and an outbreak of massive wildfires and extreme weather. It has also attracted intense praise for and criticism of the host nation, as well as a sharpening challenge to it and other leading Gulf and Middle East oil and gas exporters: How can they decarbonize their fossil-fuel-dependent domestic economies and reduce or reconfigure their hydrocarbon sales, which bring in the bulk of government revenues and export earnings?\n\n\n### Contradictory Pressures\n\n\nThe UAE\u2019s circumstances are quite similar to those of its high-income neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Other than Qatar, they all have net-zero carbon targets (UAE and Oman in 2050; Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia in 2060). In contrast, other regional oil and gas producers, notably Iran, Iraq, Egypt (host of COP27 in 2022), Libya, and Algeria have much larger populations and lower income levels, and face political and economic instability.\n\n\nCollectively, the region\u2019s major oil exporters and members of the OPEC+ alliance face contradictory pressures. Each time OPEC+ cut back production as oil prices rose sharply in 2022, they were heavily criticized by the US administration,[[1]](#_ftn1) while European politicians visited repeatedly[[2]](#_ftn2) to seek increased gas supplies to replace those lost from Russia. Not just OPEC[[3]](#_ftn3) but the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned numerous times of \u201cunderinvestment\u201d[[4]](#_ftn4) in production capacity, although other analysts suggest that aggregate upstream investment is sufficient to meet medium-term projected demand.[[5]](#_ftn5)\n\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia have significant, credible plans to expand production capacity, as does Iraq, though with a tougher challenge to deliver. And although emissions from oil and gas exports fall within the remit of the importing country, not that of the producer, these plans are seen as a threat to the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal\u2014to hold the increase in global average temperature to \u201cbelow 2\u00b0C and towards 1.5\u00b0C\u201d above preindustrial levels\u2014and an indication of these countries\u2019 lack of climate commitment. In response, the Gulf oil exporters argue that[[6]](#_ftn6):\n\n\n* Even \u201cnet-zero\u201d scenarios, such as those of the IEA, include substantial, continuing amounts of oil and gas consumption to 2050.\n* As low-cost, low-carbon, politically stable producers, it is understandable and optimal for the climate and consumers that they would increase their market share.[[7]](#_ftn7)\n* Natural field decline rates without reinvestment exceed projected rates of declines in demand, and, therefore, a lack of investment would result in high prices and economic damage, particularly in developing countries.[[8]](#_ftn8)\n\n\nAt the same time, these oil and gas exporters\u2014and particularly the four Gulf leaders Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, and Oman\u2014are seeking to play to their strengths in climate policy and diplomacy. On July 11, the UAE issued a third update to its second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC),[[9]](#_ftn9) the plan that all signatories to the Paris Agreement are meant to issue and revise at least once every five years. The new NDC describes how the UAE plans to decarbonize, indicating routes its regional peers might follow.\n\n\n### Decarbonization Strategies\n\n\nThe UAE has named Dr. Sultan Al Jaber as president-designate for COP28. He is the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), one of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies, which has plans to make substantial increases in oil and gas production capacity. As such, his appointment has received heavy criticism from various quarters, including environmental groups and some US and European lawmakers.[[10]](#_ftn10) However, in a combination of portfolios not unusual for a leading Gulf technocrat, he is also the founding CEO (2006) and current chairman of Masdar, Abu Dhabi\u2019s clean energy vehicle; the UAE\u2019s special envoy for climate change (since November 2020); and the minister of industry and advanced technology.\n\n\nThe UAE\u2019s NDC intends that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will fall 40 percent on \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d levels by 2030, or 19 percent on 2019 levels, reaching 182 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), divided between the five key emitting sectors (Figure 1), and with electricity and water sector emissions allocated to end-user sectors. This is to be achieved by a broad range of measures including renewable and nuclear power, reverse osmosis desalination, improved efficiency, district cooling and demand-side management, carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen use in industry, fugitive methane cutting, public transport and electric vehicles, innovative agricultural technologies, and others.\n\n\nNotably, carbon contracts for difference (CCFDs), as used for example in the UK[[11]](#_ftn11) and Germany,[[12]](#_ftn12) will incentivize CCS and low-carbon hydrogen (\u201cblue\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d) production, supplemented by government procurement for low-carbon steel and cement. There will also be biosequestration in mangroves and pilots of direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Although international aviation and shipping are not typically included in domestic targets in NDCs, as a major aviation and shipping hub, the UAE\u2019s NDC also describes plans for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and green shipping corridors.\n\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%205334%205076'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ME-Decarbonization_EnergyExplained_CGEP_Charts_080923.png)\n\n\nOn July 31, ADNOC announced it would advance its net-zero carbon target to 2045 from 2050; reduce carbon intensity 25 percent by 2030; and target zero methane leaks by 2030 (from 0.07 percent leakage in 2022). It reported 24 MtCO2e of direct GHG emissions in 2022, having saved 4 Mt from imports of nuclear and renewable electricity, and 1 Mt from energy efficiency and flaring reduction.[[13]](#_ftn13)\n\n\nThis is somewhat ahead of the pack of GCC national oil companies, but consistent with the general approach of attempting to improve the carbon footprint of oil and gas production[[14]](#_ftn14) by methods such as cutting flaring and methane leakage, electrifying facilities and powering them with low-carbon electricity, and using CCS for operational emissions including the CO2 content of natural gas.[[15]](#_ftn15) Saudi Aramco has a plan for a major carbon capture hub. GHG reductions come with some direct financial benefits, and may achieve premium pricing for their products, reduce costs of compliance with measures such as the European Union\u2019s intended Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and improve their position versus higher-carbon competitors.\n\n\nWhile Aramco, Qatar Energy, ADNOC, and Kuwait Oil Company all have plans to boost oil and/or gas production capacity, they are also seeking to solidify their positions in future markets, via long-term contracts for [LNG sales](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/unpacking-the-recent-china-qatar-lng-deals/)[[16]](#_ftn16) and investment in petrochemical complexes and refineries, particularly in middle-income Asian countries such as China,[[17]](#_ftn17) India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. LNG is a medium-term bet on replacing higher-carbon coal in Asia; long-lived petrochemicals, such as non-metallic materials,[[18]](#_ftn18) can be a low-emitting use.\n\n\nSaudi Arabia, the UAE, and Oman, in particular, are also seeking to be leaders in low-carbon hydrogen, mostly for export in the form of derivatives such as ammonia, methanol, and SAF, as well as for domestic use for low-carbon industrial materials, notably steel. However, the \u201crents\u201d (surplus profits) from hydrogen are much smaller than from oil and gas. Even though in total market size hydrogen may be a valuable complement to oil and gas exports by 2050, in financial terms it would be far from a replacement.\n\n\nNeighboring countries, such as Iran, Iraq, and Libya, do not have clearly articulated visions on emissions and struggle from lack of finance and political stability and direction, but they also seek to reduce flaring for more immediate financial and local environmental reasons.\n\n\n### International Climate Diplomacy\n\n\nThe Gulf oil exporters\u2019 strategies stress the role of CCS, and prefer calls to phase out \u201cunabated fossil fuels\u201d[[19]](#_ftn19) (i.e., without CCS) rather than all fossil fuels; position themselves as champions of energy access for lower-income countries; stress the need to increase climate finance to promised levels (implicitly criticizing Western countries); and forge strategic partnerships with particular countries or on particular issue. \u201cI made the case for all parties to get behind a rapid scale up of renewable energy, while we comprehensively decarbonize the current energy system and build towards a system free of all unabated fossil fuels,\u201d Dr. Al Jaber told the G20 gathering in Chennai, India, on July 28.[[20]](#_ftn20)\n\n\nThe UAE and US concluded the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy in November 2022, aiming to catalyze $100 billion of investment.[[21]](#_ftn21) In April 2021, the US Department of Energy led the establishment of the Net Zero Producers Forum, aiming to decarbonize oil and gas output, including the US, Canada, and Norway, with Qatar and Saudi Arabia; the UAE joined in May 2022.[[22]](#_ftn22) The Global Methane Pledge was launched at COP26 in the UK in November 2021, aiming for a 30 percent global reduction in methane emissions by 2030; all the GCC countries, Iraq, and all of North Africa except Algeria are participants.\n\n\nNotably, apart from some such forums and some foreign direct investment in renewables, the GCC states have cooperated little on climate strategies, investments, or infrastructure, preferring to chart their own paths. Masdar has been a prominent investor in international renewable and hydrogen projects, including in Europe and the US, and also, notably, in Central Asia and Africa. It has declared a target of 100 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by 2030,[[23]](#_ftn23) up from 20 GW last year, a level of ambition comparable to those of big European renewable players such as Iberdrola, Engie, and Enel.\n\n\nPrivate UAE companies such as AMEA Power[[24]](#_ftn24) are also active investors in African renewables, as is Acwa Power,[[25]](#_ftn25) a prominent developer 50 percent owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Nebras Power, owned by the state entity Qatar Electricity and Water Company, holds solar, wind, and hydro assets across Brazil, Australia, Ukraine, the Netherlands, and the Middle East.[[26]](#_ftn26)\n\n\nWith the GCC and other Middle East countries facing contradictory pressures, updates of their NDCs, national oil companies\u2019 climate plans, and platforms at COP28 will be critical in demonstrating ambitious and realistic pathways to rapid decarbonization.\n\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n\n[[1]](#_ftnref1)

Industry awareness for dialing down Scope 3 (or indirect) emissions is growing, yet only a handful of companies have cut this portion in any significance.\n\nThe hope, per Positive Luxury\u2019s co-chief executive officer Amy Nelson-Bennett, is to provide an ambitious commitment beyond compliance. \u201cJust like Positive Luxury\u2019s Butterfly methodology and services, this partnership is not just about depth and scope of measurement. 51toCarbonZero provides a dynamic live dashboard and together we help global companies create accountable transition plans, and take real action to accelerate reduction in their carbon emissions \u2014 as opposed to offsetting.\u201d\n\nPartners look to help luxury firms reduce reporting time, better analyze data for decision-making and fine-tune compliance. Tools span a carbon footprint measurement platform, complete with an emissions factors database and carbon calculators. Positive Luxury currently counts 170 organizations with or undergoing its Butterfly Mark certification process. Positive Luxury is in talks with 10 clients who are interested in taking their assessments further under the new partnership. Last year, Positive Luxury introduced the new [Connected Butterfly Mark](https://wwd.com/sustainability/business/positive-luxury-butterfly-mark-expands-sustainability-reporting-1235342581/) which is one iteration of a digital product passport.

The airport also commits to continuing regular disclosure of progress as part of this process. \n\n\nWellington Airport chief executive Matt Clarke says:\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering this process because we want to ensure our emissions targets are credible and that we\u2019re accountable for our progress.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us that our targets are more than just talk, and that we deliver.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already made good progress with our net emissions down 27% since 2017. The challenge is to maintain this and decouple emissions from passenger growth.\n\n\n\u201cImproving our energy efficiency in the terminal and replacing ground vehicles with electric vehicles have made a real difference, and the next big steps are to replace our gas boiler system and use only certified renewable electricity. \n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also working directly with airlines to support their decarbonisation goals, because the entire aviation system needs to decarbonise, not just airports. Our location is ideally suited to be a hub for electric flights and we\u2019re working with the Government and airlines to speed up the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).\u201d \n\n\nOther recent progress by Wellington Airport includes:\n\n\n Achieving Level 2 (Reduction) Certification from the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme.  \n\n Rated third best participating airport in the world for performance and management of environmental, social and governance by GRESB assessment.  \n\n Converting $100 million of bank facilities into sustainability linked loans.  \n\n Partnering with electric aircraft manufacturer Heart Aerospace alongside other New Zealand airports and airlines.\n\n\n Further information\n\n\nThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global body enabling businesses to set ambitious emissions reduction targets in line with the latest climate science. The SBTi\u2019s goal is to accelerate companies across the world to support the global economy to halve emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero before 2050.\n\n\nThe initiative is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments.\n\n\nThe SBTi defines and promotes best practice in science-based target setting, offers resources and guidance to reduce barriers to adoption, and independently assesses and approves companies\u2019 targets.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n#### Join the Wellington ScoopCitizen Community\n\nTo keep Wellington.Scoop thriving we need your support.

Z\u00fchlke aims to achieve net zero Scope 1+2 emissions by 2030, and to become net zero across the entire value chain by 2040. This requires a wide range of measures to reduce emissions by 90% against the company\u2019s 2021 baseline. \n\n\nCompared with its targets, Z\u00fchlke\u2019s overall results for 2022 were disappointing, with a total emissions rise of 41% to 8,489 t CO2e. This was the result of three main drivers: team growth of 20%, an increase in post-pandemic travel and office use, and long lead times for several reduction activities. Despite these challenges, the business was able to lower operational emissions (Scope 1+2) by 5% compared to 2021. It also reduced Scope 2 against overall growth, mainly through switches to renewable electricity. \n\n\nAs part of its focus on sustainable ways of working, Z\u00fchlke also announced steps to ensure \u2018equal pay for equal work\u2019 and committed to publishing dedicated reporting on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). \n\n\nIn the report\u2019s opening letter, Z\u00fchlke Chairman Philipp Sutter stressed the importance of collective business action to advance sustainability: \u2018The long-term success of our clients, and Z\u00fchlke in turn, is deeply connected with the world around us. To thrive in the future, we will need business models, innovation systems, and solutions that positively impact people, planet, and profit. By teaming up with diverse partners with complementary data, capabilities, and a shared goal, we have the means to co-create better solutions \u2013 efficiently, effectively, and at scale\u2019. \n\n\n\"At Z\u00fchlke, we\u2019re convinced that borderless innovation and technology can be a positive force of change for business and society. We take our organisational responsibility here very seriously. Our first Corporate Responsibility Report showed how we made sustainability a strategic goal and consolidated a group-wide approach to decarbonisation. In this report, we explore our 2022 milestones and onward journey.\"  \nFabrizio Ferrandina,  \nGroup CEO, Z\u00fchlke\n\nZ\u00fchlke Group  \n\n[asia@zuhlke.com](mailto:asia@zuhlke.com)  \n\n Lorraine Lai  \n\n Visit us on social media:  \n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zuehlke.group/)  \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zuehlke_group)  \n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zuehlkegroup)  \n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zuehlkegroup/)  \n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/zuhlkegroup)\n\n\n![](https://www.einnews.com/tracking/article.gif?aid=650030232&section=einpresswire&a=qPPXJOhtM2I-u2BI&i=E018UZw7P5TEJgK1)\n\nYou just read:\n\n\nCo-innovating a sustainable future: Z\u00fchlke publishes 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report\n=========================================================================================\n\n\n\n\nNews Provided By\n\n[Zuhlke](https://www.einpresswire.com/sources/u456491?promo=4700)\n\n\n August 15, 2023, 23:15 GMT\n \n\n\nShare This Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Distribution channels:\n [Banking, Finance & Investment Industry](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/banking-finance-investment?promo=4700), [Business & Economy](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/business-economy?promo=4700), [IT Industry](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/it?promo=4700), [Technology](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/technology?promo=4700), [World & Regional](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/world-regional?promo=4700)\n\n\n  \n\n EIN Presswire's priority is source transparency.

Sharp plans to release a 25.3\u201d and a 13.3\u201d model to the market in October and September 2023 respectively.\n\nThis press release features multimedia.

However, it is still common to see paper posters used in areas where it is difficult to install digital signage, or where access to power is an issue, or in locations that cannot support the weight of a large, light- emissive screen. As cities and companies prioritize more sustainable solutions into their space design, and limit the use of power-hungry light emissive displays, reflective, non-emissive E Ink displays provide an ideal solution. E Ink\u2019s ePaper displays only consume power when being updated, drastically reducing the power draw of the display. As the world\u2019s only Dark Sky Association approved digital signage, E Ink\u2019s displays do not contribute to light pollution and can run off batteries or solar cells, freeing the units from being placed on the power grid.\n\nThe Sharp ePoster products can be easily updated using a USB flash drive and can also be updated via a smartphone app. When combined with e-Signage S, Sharp\u2019s proprietary software system for content distribution and management (sold separately), the display can be updated over a network, making managing and operating the display smooth and easy, including updating content on multiple display units at one time, specifying the updating date and time, and more.\n\nThree years ago, Sharp Corporation and E Ink began collaborating with the goal of combining their strengths to contribute to the carbon-neutral era by popularizing digital posters. The potential of these digital posters has been confirmed through marketing activities, such as exhibiting prototype displays at exhibitions both within Japan and around the globe. In April 2023, Sharp released their 42-inch monochrome ePoster digital paper display in the Japanese market. In addition to having a power consumption of 0 W during display, it also uses light reflected from outside sources to display its image, providing optimal visibility even in bright environments. In March 2023 E Ink and Sharp announced their collaboration to bring ePaper ePosters to market, with the 25.3\u201d and 13.3\u201d devices to be first to launch.\n\nSince entering the digital signage business in 2005, Sharp has become a market leader both through the development of displays, and by offering a wide variety of solutions for digital displays\u2014from planning, production, consulting, and system construction to installation and maintenance\u2014that can fit any given installation location.\n\n\"We are excited to see the launch of the new Sharp ePoster devices, and the progression of our work with Sharp,\" stated Naoki Sumita, President, Sales & Marketing, Japan, of E Ink. \"As cities and communities look to reduce their carbon footprint, E Ink offers a grid-free solution to enable their sustainability efforts and Sharp is ideally positioned to bring this solution to market.\"\n\nSharp and E Ink will continue working together on new advancements for ePosters and to expand their efforts worldwide. The companies are excited to bring to market solutions that balance the need for digital content with the needs for devices that fit into the carbon-neutral era.\n\n*Estimated environmental impact of ePaper (researched by E Ink)*\n\nWith the trend towards ESG sustainable development, digital transformation places more emphasis on low-carbon and energy-saving characteristics. ePaper has the features of sunlight readability, low power consumption, and compatibility with solar power systems, making it suitable as an environmentally friendly outdoor ePaper signage. E Ink compared the impact of 32-inch paper advertisements, LCD screens, and ePaper screens on carbon emissions for outdoor digital signage. If 100,000 ePaper signage operate for 20 hours a day, update their ads twenty times per hour, and last for five years, the use of ePaper signage is estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by 500,000 tons compared to LCD signage. Compared to traditional paper posters that are printed once and disposed of, the use of ePaper signage can reduce CO2 emissions by about 21 million tons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*About E Ink*\n\nE Ink Holdings Inc.

These projects will avoid emissions from their degradation, contribute to additional carbon sequestration and at the same time, promote multiple environmental and social benefits.\n\n\nIts business plan focuses on regions where Iberdrola is present and where these nature-based solutions have significant potential, so that Latin American countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile will host 80% of its projects, while countries in the northern hemisphere, such as Spain, the United Kingdom and Portugal, will account for the remaining 20%. Carbon2Nature is already working on the development of projects in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Spain.\n\n\nAll projects will be certified against internationally recognised quality standards, which will also validate their contribution to improving biodiversity, the\u00a0well-being of local communities and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\u00a0\n\n\nCarbon2Nature underscores Iberdrola's commitment to a sustainable energy model in harmony with nature and people. This model is underpinned by two main objectives: to\u00a0achieve net-zero emissions in all scopes by 2040 and to have a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2030.\n\n\nThe programme's ecosystem includes more than\u00a07,500 start-ups,\u00a0including unicorns - companies valued at more than $1 billion - such as electric vehicle charging solutions manufacturer Wallbox and Stem, which offers smart battery storage solutions.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFind out more [here](https://www.iberdrola.com/press-room/news/detail/iberdrola-launches-carbon2nature-to-reduce-the-global-carbon-footprint-through-nature-based-solutions).\n\n\n\n\n\n* Posted In: [Worldwide](/topics/worldwide), [Air Pollution](/topics/air-pollution), [Agriculture](/topics/agriculture), [Technology](/topics/technology)\n* \n\n\n\n\n\n### Related Content\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](/images/made/images/uploads/articles/aafarm4_400_250_80_s_c1.jpg)](https://www.climateaction.org/news/cutting-edge-farming-technology-awarded-9m)\n\n##### [Cutting-edge farming technology awarded \u00a39m](https://www.climateaction.org/news/cutting-edge-farming-technology-awarded-9m)\n\n\n[Europe](javascript:void(0);), [Policy](javascript:void(0);), [Agriculture](javascript:void(0);)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](/images/made/images/uploads/articles/lgim_400_250_s_c1.png)](https://www.climateaction.org/news/lgim-collaborates-with-national-trust-to-launch-fossil-fuel-exclusions-stra)\n\n##### [LGIM collaborates with National Trust to launch fossil fuel exclusions strategy](https://www.climateaction.org/news/lgim-collaborates-with-national-trust-to-launch-fossil-fuel-exclusions-stra)\n\n\n[Europe](javascript:void(0);), [Air Pollution](javascript:void(0);), [Policy](javascript:void(0);)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](/images/made/images/uploads/articles/aiensee4_400_250_80_s_c1.JPG)](https://www.climateaction.org/news/new-framework-published-for-investors-to-assess-alignment-of-oil-gas-compan)\n\n##### [New framework published for investors to assess alignment of oil & gas...](https://www.climateaction.org/news/new-framework-published-for-investors-to-assess-alignment-of-oil-gas-compan)\n\n\n[Worldwide](javascript:void(0);), [Finance](javascript:void(0);), [Energy](javascript:void(0);)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](/images/made/images/uploads/articles/hydrogen_1_400_250_s_c1.png)](https://www.climateaction.org/news/bosch-enters-the-hydrogen-age-of-mobility)\n\n##### [Bosch to invest nearly 2.5 billion euros into hydrogen technology](https://www.climateaction.org/news/bosch-enters-the-hydrogen-age-of-mobility)\n\n\n[Worldwide](javascript:void(0);), [Hydrogen](javascript:void(0);), [Air Pollution](javascript:void(0);)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](/images/made/images/uploads/articles/afarm3_400_250_80_s_c1.jpg)](https://www.climateaction.org/news/investment-of-168m-awarded-to-drive-innovation-and-boost-farming-productivi)\n\n##### [Investment of \u00a3168m awarded to drive innovation and boost farming productivity](https://www.climateaction.org/news/investment-of-168m-awarded-to-drive-innovation-and-boost-farming-productivi)\n\n\n[Europe](javascript:void(0);), [Finance](javascript:void(0);), [Policy](javascript:void(0);)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![](/images/made/images/uploads/articles/aejerer5443_400_250_80_s_c1.JPG)](https://www.climateaction.org/news/king-attends-national-climate-clock-switch-on-at-climate-innovation-forum)\n\n##### [King attends national Climate Clock switch on at Climate Innovation Forum](https://www.climateaction.org/news/king-attends-national-climate-clock-switch-on-at-climate-innovation-forum)\n\n\n[Worldwide](javascript:void(0);)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Iberdrola launches Carbon2Nature to reduce the carbon footprint through nature-based solutions", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article provides information about Iberdrola launching Carbon2Nature, but it does not indicate a positive or negative sentiment."}], "semantic_commentary": "Aligns with our mission;

Photo: Xinhua\n\n  \nTuesday, August 15, marks China's first National Ecology Day. On August 15, 2005, 18 years ago, Xi Jinping, then Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), first put forward the concept that green mountains are themselves gold mountains, when he visited Yucun, a village in Zhejiang Province.  \n  \nAt a national conference on ecological and environmental protection in July 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China should support high-quality development with a high-quality ecological environment and promote the modernization featuring the harmonious co-existence between human and nature.\u00a0  \n  \nOver the past decades, China has made extraordinary progress, emerging as a world leader in renewable energy, electric vehicles, green public transport and biodiversity protection.  \n  \nA BBC News article of June 29 noted that, of the half a trillion US dollars spent worldwide on wind and solar last year, China accounted for 55 percent. China's solar capacity is now greater than that of the rest of the world combined. Indeed, it can reasonably be considered as the first \"renewable energy superpower.\"  \n  \nAround 99 percent of the world's electric buses are in China, along with 70 percent of the world's high-speed rail. China is carrying out the largest reforestation project in the world, with forest coverage having doubled from 12 percent in 1980 to 24 percent last year.  \n  \nAnd China's commitment to green development is only deepening. Environmental sustainability is a central theme at all levels of government, and the nation's ambitious goals to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 are actively informing China's economic strategy.  \n  \nA detailed report by the San Francisco-based NGO Global Energy Monitor found that China's green energy targets for 2030 are likely to be reached in 2025. As the British environmentalist Mike Berners Lee wrote: \"More than in most countries, if a policy idea is seen as a good thing, the Chinese can bring it about.\" This is of course a reflection of China's socialist system, which is structured in such a way that political and economic priorities are determined not by capital's drive for constant expansion but by the needs and aspirations of the people.\u00a0  \n  \nChina's sustained investment in renewable energy has meant a global reduction in costs, such that in much of the world, solar and wind power are increasingly price-competitive with fossil fuels. According to the International Energy Agency, China's huge investment in green energy has \"contributed to a cost decline more than 80 percent, helping solar PV to become the most affordable electricity generation technology in many parts of the world.\"  \n  \nChina's construction of an ecological civilization constitutes a profound contribution to humanity.\u00a0  \n  \nOne might expect Western countries to be appreciative of China's role. It is precisely these countries that should really be taking the lead on sustainable development; after all, they are responsible for the bulk of historic emissions, and continue to top the charts when it comes to per-capita emissions. The New York Times reported in 2021 that \"23 rich, developed countries are responsible for half of all historical CO2 emissions,\" with the US alone accounting for just under 25 percent, in spite of its representing just 4 percent of the global population.  \n  \nThe principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities, agreed at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, makes it clear that rich, industrialised countries should be blazing a trail on preventing climate breakdown, and should be supporting developing countries to adopt an environmentally-friendly development model.  \n  \nThe unfortunate reality is that these rich countries have made barely any progress on tackling climate change. Inasmuch as they have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions, it has been achieved largely through exporting their industry to manufacturing powerhouses in the developing world, principally China.  \n  \nMeanwhile, the US' accelerating drive to preserve its hegemony at all costs is causing major setbacks to humanity's shared project of maintaining a planet fit for human habitation.  \n  \nAs part of its proxy war on Russia, the Biden administration has been heavily promoting sanctions on Russian gas and pushing Europe toward reducing its reliance on Russian energy long term. The results of this include a huge increase in US exports of fracked shale gas to Europe; a rise in coal consumption in Europe; and ramped up oil drilling in the North Sea.  \n  \nThis year alone, the US government has approved the enormous Willow oil drilling project on Alaska's North Slope - \"a huge climate threat\" which is \"inconsistent with this administration's promises to take on the climate crisis,\" according to Jeremy Lieb of the environmental law group Earthjustice. The Biden administration also announced in May that it would sell off more than 73 million acres of waters in the Gulf of Mexico for purposes of offshore oil and gas drilling, thereby locking in fossil fuel development in the region for decades to come.  \n  \nGermany, for decades a poster child of the renewable energy movement, has started reopening its coal mines. Its coal use is up, corresponding to a decrease in natural gas imported from Russia.  \n  \nThe British government is majorly backtracking on its climate commitments. Just a few days ago, with the world experiencing unprecedented temperatures - along with wildfires and floods - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to \"max out\" the country's oil and gas reserves, revealing plans for a new round of North Sea drilling.  \n  \nThe West should be cooperating with China on tackling the climate crisis - developing integrated supply chains, transmission capacity, biodiversity protection systems and more. What the US and its allies do instead is to impose blanket sanctions on China - on the basis of disgusting, absurd and false slanders about human rights abuses in Xinjiang - in a bid to cripple China's solar energy industry. It seems the slogan \"better dead than red\" lives on in the 21st century.  \n  \nThe governments of the Global South on the other hand, lacking the monstrous motivations of the new cold war, are enthusiastically cooperating with China and benefitting from its experience, support and investment. Prominent Tsinghua University economist Hu Angang writes that China's model can \"provide southern countries with a new path leading to ecological civilization and development - the green development path.\"  \n  \nChinese financing for renewable power generation overseas has increased exponentially in the last decade, and now accounts for the large majority of Chinese-financed overseas power generation capacity. China is involved in huge renewable energy projects throughout Africa and Latin America.  \n  \nMeanwhile, an important set of guidelines has been issued for greening the Belt and Road Initiative, identifying key steps to reduce emissions, reduce pollution and protect biodiversity in China-financed infrastructure projects worldwide.  \n  \nThe countries of the Global South are joining hands to build a greener future, while the West pushes repeatedly on the self-destruct button. Environmentalists in the West should draw the appropriate lessons, resolutely reject anti-China hysteria, oppose decoupling, oppose the new cold war, and promote maximum global cooperation to save the planet.  \n  \n*The author is a British author and independent political commentator. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn*   \n\n\n\n\n\n- \n\n- \n\n-

Zhejiang Province. (Xinhua/Weng Xinyang)\n\nBEIJING, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- China marks its first National Ecology Day on Tuesday, designated to enhance public awareness and actions to protect the ecological environment, as part of the country's efforts to pursue harmony between humanity and nature.\n\nUnder the guidance of President Xi Jinping, China has seen historic changes on ecological conservation, upholding the belief that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, a core concept of Xi's thought on ecological civilization.\n\nMaking instructions on National Ecology Day, Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, urged the whole of society to vigorously promote and act as role models in practicing it.\n\nBETTER LIVING ENVIRONMENT\n\nXi proposed the concept on Aug. 15, 2005, when he was visiting Yucun Village in east China's Zhejiang Province, where he praised the villagers' decision to shut down limestone mines and cement factories after the industry caused severe damage to the local environment. Xi was then the Party chief of Zhejiang.\n\nYucun has now successfully turned to green industries, including ecological tourism, for more sustainable development, providing a fine example of the sweeping environmental changes across the nation.\n\nSince the 18th CPC National Congress, China has taken a series of groundbreaking steps on ecological conservation, with unprecedented determination, intensity and effectiveness.\n\nIn 2015, a revised environmental protection law came into effect, with the provisions hailed as \"the strictest\" in history. In 2017, pollution control was identified as one of China's \"three tough battles,\" along with poverty relief and risk control. In 2018, China incorporated ecological civilization into its Constitution for the first time.\n\nConcrete measures have also been taken in the past decade, including the ecological protection \"red line,\" the establishment of a system of river chiefs and lake chiefs, as well as the systemic protection and management of mountains, rivers, forests, farmland, lakes, grass and sand.\n\nDue to tenacious efforts, China's PM2.5 density fell 57 percent from 2013 to 2022, while the annual number of days with serious air pollution dropped sharply by 92 percent.\n\nPlanting trees has become a common practice for the Chinese people, and the country has created the world's largest area of planted forests, with its forest coverage rate more than doubling from 12 percent in the early 1980s to over 24 percent last year.\n\nWater quality has also shown remarkable improvement, with 84.9 percent of surface water sections achieving the excellent quality grade, approaching the levels seen in developed countries.\n\nTo keep improving the quality of our ecological environment, we should keep doing what we are doing now, and go deep in a bid to keep our skies blue, waters clear and lands pollution-free, Xi said at a national conference on ecological and environmental protection held in July.\n\nMORE ABUNDANT WILD SPECIES\n\nBelieving that biodiversity makes Earth full of vigor and vitality and lays the foundation for human survival and development, Xi has led China in achieving steady progress on addressing biodiversity loss.\n\nStarting from 2021, China has imposed a 10-year ban on fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River basin, with 228,000 fishermen on 110,000 boats relinquishing their nets. Xi said the cost of the policy was not small, \"but it is worthwhile to protect the ecology of the whole basin.\"\n\nThe fishing ban has already achieved solid progress on ecological conservation. The Yangtze finless porpoises, an endangered species known as the \"giant panda of the water,\" have been spotted more frequently in Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.\n\nIn the Jianli section of the Yangtze River, the number of fish roes produced by the four major Chinese carps during the breeding season surged from less than 100 million to 7.87 billion.\n\nAcross the country, wildlife on\u00a0plateaus and mountains, as\u00a0well as\u00a0in the rainforests, is also making a comeback amid\u00a0the country's efforts\u00a0to build the world's largest national park system.\n\nThe first batch of national parks established in 2021, with a protected land area of 230,000 square km, are home to nearly 30 percent of the key terrestrial wildlife species found in the country, while the authenticity and integrity of the ecosystems in these parks are under effective protection.\n\n![](202308156c2b8f148419413db0847369f3aeb269_XxjwshE007106_20230815_CBMFN0A002.jpg)\n\nThis aerial photo taken on May 16, 2023 shows wind turbines of Honghe Yongning wind power plant in Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, southwest China's Yunnan Province.(Yunnan Provincial Energy Investment Group/Handout via Xinhua)\n\nLOW-CARBON SHIFT\n\nXi has on many occasions stressed efforts to advance the transition to low-carbon development, as China joins the world to address climate change.\n\nChina has pledged to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, representing the biggest cut in carbon emission intensity in the shortest period of time that the world has ever seen.\n\nIn doing so, China has taken the initiative, instead of doing it passively, Xi once said.\n\nA cleaner energy system is an important part of China's low-carbon endeavors. The country has developed the world's largest clean coal-burning power generation base, built up the world's highest capacity of installed wind and photovoltaic power, and established the world's largest carbon market for greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nChina's energy intensity -- the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP -- decreased 26.4 percent in the past decade, according to the National Development and Reform Commission, adding that the country has exceeded its target for reducing carbon emission intensity pledged to the international community.\n\nAs\u00a0China's green shift gathers pace, Xi has called for concrete\u00a0and constant efforts\u00a0across the society to make greater contributions to jointly build a clean and beautiful world.\n\nIn September 2021, China announced that it would stop building new coal-fired projects overseas, pledging\u00a0that it would step up support\u00a0for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy.\n\n\"We only have one Earth. Protecting the ecological environment and pushing sustainable development are our joint obligations,\" Xi once said.\u00a0 \u25a0\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "China marks its first National Ecology Day to enhance public awareness and actions to protect the ecological environment under the guidance of President Xi Jinping.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "China's efforts to pursue harmony between humanity and nature are commendable."}, {"summary": "Concrete measures have been taken in the past decade to improve China's ecological environment, including significant reductions in PM2.5 density and serious air pollution, as well as an increase in forest coverage and improved water quality.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "China's efforts have yielded positive results in improving the ecological environment."}, {"summary": "China has made progress in biodiversity conservation, including a 10-year fishing ban in the key waters of the Yangtze River basin, leading to positive outcomes such as increased sightings of endangered species and a surge in fish roes.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Efforts to protect biodiversity have resulted in positive ecological conservation outcomes."}, {"summary": "China is actively transitioning to low-carbon development with efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, develop cleaner energy systems, and achieve carbon neutrality.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "China's commitment to low-carbon development demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing climate change."}], "semantic_commentary": "Relevance: China taking steps to reduce carbon emissions and protect environment.", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon and China's efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and achieve carbon neutrality."}]}, {"source": "The Colorado Sun", "link": "https://coloradosun.com/2023/08/15/copper-mountain-conservation-summit/", "title": "Copper Mountain leads ski resorts in biodiversity strategies", "content": "\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/outsider_newsletter_header_transparent-1200x424.png?resize=780%2C276&ssl=1)\nThis story first appeared in **The Outsider**, the premium outdoor newsletter by Jason Blevins.  \n  \nIn it, he covers the industry from the inside out, plus the fun side of being outdoors in our beautiful state.\n\n\n\n[SUBSCRIBE](/outsider)\n\n\n**COPPER MOUNTAIN** \u2014 The Texas college students carefully charted the greenery on the ski slope and bagged soil samples as part of a multiyear study that will map out strategies for increasing biodiversity at ski areas.\u00a0\n\n\nSeveral earthmovers growled in the background, scraping several acres of undeveloped land to make room for a private club, boutique hotel, condos and slopeside homes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to notice that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Sheehan Meagher, a soil technician with the White River National Forest who was attending a conservation summit for ski resort sustainability leaders. \u201cMaybe that is an example of where we are and where we are going? Hopefully.\u201d\n\n\n \n \n\nCopper Mountain has identified 558 acres on the front side of its ski area where soil work can help restore ecosystems and improve biodiversity to help lessen the snow-stealing blow of climate change. Last year the resort announced [a 10-year carbon sequestration plan](https://coloradosun.com/2022/08/02/copper-mountain-climate-change-carbon-sequestration/) to plant carbon-storing plants and grasses on its ski slopes. The resort has tapped researchers at Southwestern University in Texas in the effort, with student scientists staking out test plots on five ski runs where they can monitor vegetation growth using native seeds, compost and [biochar](https://coloradosun.com/2023/04/07/biochar-carbon-capture-climate-change/).\n\n\nThe ski area hosted several resort leaders at its second-annual conservation summit earlier this month in an effort to share their research, strategies and projects. A large focus was restoring biological vibrancy on ski slopes, which too often are simply treated like lawns instead of critical components of mountain ecosystems. Last year sustainability workers at Copper Mountain started collecting seeds from 27 native species and replanting them across the resort\u2019s north-facing ski runs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are experimenting. We are trying to figure out how to make all this work at a landscape level,\u201d said Jeff Grasser as he sifted through charred wood chips in a 50-gallon drum that he will carefully spread across plots of ski slopes to see how the porous, lightweight biochar might help native grasses and forbs thrive.\u00a0\n\n\nThe aptly named Grasser is the head of sustainability at Copper Mountain. He\u2019s got big plans. What if he could create \u201ctons and tons\u201d of biochar in massive kilns, not just little drums? What if Copper Mountain owner Powdr deploys its fleet of helicopters used for skiing in Utah in the winter to help spread biochar across all the ski slopes at the company\u2019s 10 mountain resorts?\n\n\n\u201cWe want to do this in ways that can be done on a very large scale and we can\u2019t wait to share these results with you,\u201d Grasser told the group of resort sustainability leaders.\u00a0\n\n\nThe conservation summit included a presentation from folks at Arapahoe Basin detailing how crews replaced vegetation by hand and preserved top soil when installing new chairlift towers. Folks from Eldora Mountain Resort offered details of a project with the Town of Nederland to build a wetland to replace a trailhead parking lot. Sunlight ski area took a page from Copper Mountain\u2019s biodiversity playbook and began collecting native seeds for replanting on ski runs.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Copper Mountain project will build a dataset of more than 100 locations across the ski area, with 10 years of science showing how native grasses, compost and biochar can help resort operators regain a more diverse, balanced ecosystem on ski slopes.\n\n\nGrasser does not see the beeping backhoes churning dirt for luxury condos beneath the study plots on the [Formidable ski run](https://www.exploringtherockies.com/copper-mountain-guide/10-steepest-runs/) as overshadowing his ambitious study of seeds and grasses. Those machines and that project are motivating, he said.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe want to work with some of our most disturbed locations and then study how we can improve those areas and do it in ways that are verifiable and academically robust,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we have a story where we can say \u2018Hey this works really well. Don\u2019t just take my word for it. We have scientific evidence that supports these methods. These are the first steps in delivering resilience so diversity can grow.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Daily Sun-Up podcast | [More

Images\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of America is baking under [record heat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/01/record-breaking-heat-2023/) or seeing sunlight filtered through the [haze of wildfires](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/06/08/how-wildfire-smoke-can-travel-thousands-of-miles-and-how-to-protect-yourself/) thousands of miles away. Weather like this is a potent reminder of the need to reduce greenhouse gases to slow the effects of global warming.\n\n\nOne valuable tool that has not yet been used to its fullest extent to accomplish those reductions is [trading carbon offset credits](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/energy-transition/061021-voluntary-carbon-markets-pricing-participants-trading-corsia-credits). \n\n\n\n\n \n\nThese trading markets provide a way for businesses to offset their own carbon emissions with a reduction of an equal amount of carbon emissions elsewhere. To achieve this, companies purchase carbon credits issued by projects that aim to reduce or eliminate emissions. Some examples include renewable energy initiatives such as wind farms, forest conservation and afforestation, and carbon capture projects.\u00a0\n\n\nBy doing so, they create a market-driven approach to mitigating the growth in greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the impact of the global warming ravaging the planet.\n\n\nSeveral markets have been trading offsets in the United States [for several years](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46956#:~:text=Compliance%20Carbon%20Markets,-Compliance%20carbon%20markets&text=There%20are%20currently%20two%20compliance,that%20operates%20in%2011%20states.), but their effectiveness has been limited because they are only local or regional in scope. Other countries are currently [setting rules](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-06/global-carbon-market-countries-start-to-set-new-rules-for-credits-offsets) for their own carbon markets. \n\n\nBut for offset trading to work, the market needs to be much broader. Climate change is a global crisis, after all, so we need a solution that\u2019s global, too.\n\n\nLocal and regional markets are so small and attract such limited trading volume that they are not taken seriously as an asset class. Reuters reported that voluntary carbon offset markets combined for [only $2 billion in trades in 2021](https://www.reuters.com/markets/carbon/voluntary-carbon-markets-set-become-least-five-times-bigger-by-2030-shell-2023-01-19/). For comparison, average trading value on the New York Stock Exchange is more than [$1 trillion every day](https://www.nyse.com/markets/us-equity-volumes).\n\n\nInstitutional investors in particular have little interest in such small markets because they offer limited liquidity and make it difficult to invest at scale. To work most efficiently, these markets need to be much larger to attract the attention of investors who have enough capital to make a difference. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nExamples of these investors include entities with substantial exposure to climate-related risks, such as insurance companies that are likely to be interested in investing in market-traded carbon credits as a way to partly hedge their exposure. Markets with credible verification standards will help speed this development.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nTo fully take advantage of the impact of carbon offset markets, we need to establish a market that allows someone in Germany to trade with someone in the United States to reduce carbon emissions everywhere.\n\n\nAlong with this market would come a global set of standards and regulation for verification so everyone is operating on the same page. A criticism of carbon offsets trading is that it allows polluters to continue polluting without a reliable method of ensuring that the promised offsetting reduction in emissions is in fact achieved. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nThese markets have also faced additional controversy because some companies are being [assigned more credits than they have earned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-03-24/carbon-offset-seller-s-forest-protection-projects-questioned). Having credible verification standards and regulations will help address this concern by providing the evidence that emissions are being reduced.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Biden must immediately call Niger\u2019s coup a \u2018coup\u2019](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4155401-biden-must-immediately-call-nigers-coup-a-coup/) \n[From UFOs to DEI: Why diversity, equity and inclusion should go interstellar](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/4153930-from-ufos-to-dei-why-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-should-go-interstellar/) \n\nBut most importantly, a market that is truly global in scope would make carbon offsets a more credible asset class to attract institutions large enough to invest the amount of capital required for successful carbon mitigation efforts.\n\n\nDevelopment of these markets is currently stuck in rule-making limbo. As fires, floods and heat only get worse, negotiators need to come to an agreement soon so we can take advantage of the markets\u2019 promise in finding a solution.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n*Ashish Tiwari is professor of finance at the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags \n[carbon market](\n\t\thttps://thehill.com/social-tags/carbon-market/\t\t) \n[Carbon offset](\n\t\thttps://thehill.com/social-tags/carbon-offset/\t\t) \n[Climate change](\n\t\thttps://thehill.com/social-tags/climate-change/\t\t) \n[Greenhouse gas emissions](\n\t\thttps://thehill.com/social-tags/greenhouse-gas-emissions/\t\t) \n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nCopyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

These rights are traded by companies as tokens known as carbon credits, which can be sold multiple times. Carbon credits are often called \u201coffsets\u201d, but this term\u00a0is confusing because offsetting means organisations or individuals claiming that credits directly counterbalance their own continued emissions.\n\nThe VCM may have [evolved](https://voluntarycarbonmarket.org/docs/VCM-Interactive-PDF-Version-1-With-Introduction.pdf) over more than two decades, but it is in the past three years that its monetary value has grown most rapidly, hitting [US$2 billion in 2021](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/publications/state-of-the-voluntary-carbon-markets-2022/). Analysts have estimated that this could increase to the [tens of billions](https://trove-research.com/report/future-size-of-the-voluntary-carbon-market/) by 2030.\n\nThese sums are tiny compared to [overall needs](https://unctad.org/news/blog-cop27-debrief-milestones-climate-resilient-development-sharm-el-sheikh#:~:text=Climate%20finance,to%20%246%20trillion%20a%20year.) for the global transition to net-zero emissions; for comparison, governments worldwide received US$56 billion from [mandatory emissions permits](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/a1abead2-de91-5992-bb7a-73d8aaaf767f) in 2021. But they could still benefit the world\u2019s [climate](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement) and [sustainable development](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) goals. Under the right conditions, carbon credits raise investment for essential elements of any viable global climate strategy.\n\nCarbon markets: voluntary or mandatory?Voluntary participation by buyers differentiates the VCM from so-called \u201ccompliance\u201d markets created by government policy. Domestic markets include emissions trading systems (ETS), where participating companies must buy\u00a0official emissions permits to cover any surplus emissions above a regulated threshold.\n\nSome compliance markets are international, like CORSIA, an international scheme requiring airlines to compensate for emissions above a threshold.\n\nTo complicate matters, compliance markets can overlap with the VCM. For instance, [CORSIA rules](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/CORSIA-Emissions-Units.aspx) allow airlines to use credits from certain independent standards. In [some](https://verra.org/programs/verified-carbon-standard/vcs-in-compliance-markets/) [cases](https://bezerocarbon.com/insights/japan-may-be-a-window-into-the-future-of-carbon-markets/), governments allow companies in their domestic compliance markets to use voluntary credits to meet their obligations.\n\nCarbon credits are generated by activities like protecting forests and wetlands, providing clean cookstoves to households that don\u2019t have access to electricity, and switching to low-carbon forms of agriculture. Scale varies: credits to date are mostly from local-level projects such as building a wind farm or protecting rainforest on a plot of land, but programmes that take place across a whole region or country are gaining momentum for [energy](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/u-s-state-department-bezos-earth-fund-and-rockefeller-foundation-announce-next-steps-on-energy-transition-accelerator/) and [forests](https://leafcoalition.org/). Typically, non-governmental organisations such as [Verra](https://verra.org/programs/verified-carbon-standard/), [Gold Standard,](https://www.goldstandard.org/project-developers/standard-documents) and the [American Carbon Registry](https://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/american-carbon-registry-standard) assess activities, certify those that meet their standards, issue credits on their behalf and track those on a registry.\n\nChallenges for the voluntary carbon market\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe VCM has an uncertain future. Carbon credits and companies using them have had some [bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p8zAbFKpW0) [press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61SWIYwCaSE) for seeming not to meet the standards they claim, and the past year has seen a [gradual decline](https://carboncredits.com/the-flight-to-quality-in-the-carbon-offset-credit-markets-with-their-prices/) in credit prices. However, governance bodies are releasing new standards and guidance throughout 2023 to serve as new \u201crules of the game\u201d and restore trust among stakeholders and the public. The challenges associated with ensuring a positive impact on climate and development \u2013 commonly referred to as \u201cintegrity\u201d \u2013 can be grouped into three buckets: the quality of credit supply, credible demand from buyers, and how the market functions.\n\n[High credit quality](https://vcmprimer.org/chapter-6/) has several dimensions. Changes in emissions must be calculated accurately and account for \u201cleakage\u201d, whereby emissions rise elsewhere. An activity should be \u201cadditional\u201d, meaning that it wouldn\u2019t have taken place without credits. Activities are unlikely to be additional if they are financially viable outside of the VCM or mandated by government policy. Reductions or removals of GHGs should be permanent (in effect, lasting at least several decades). Finally, there should be no negative impacts on other aspects of sustainable development, such as protecting biodiversity or supporting women\u2019s empowerment \u2013 ideally, credits should have positive impacts on these goals. All of these attributes should be monitored and reported transparently, and verified by legitimate third parties, usually provided by specialist firms.\n\nIntegrity: reductions versus removalsThere is a [common perception](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-the-voluntary-carbon-market-is-thriving) that GHG removals are higher quality than emission reductions \u2013 especially since a [high-profile set of principles](https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-offsetting-principles#:~:text=Overview,elements%20to%20successful%20offsetting%20practice.), published by Oxford academics, encouraged a shift towards removals by 2050. This requires nuance.\n\nSince measuring reductions requires assessing a hypothetical situation where the activity didn\u2019t take place, removals can be easier to verify. Net zero, whether at global or organisational level, can only be achieved with removals. However, many emissions reductions are essential in the near-term and could prevent cascading emissions and temperature rises, such as protecting rainforests or mangroves. And in 2023, [monitoring, reporting and verification](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/strengthening-mrv-standards-for-greenhouse-gas-removals/) for removals remains patchy. Whatever the type of activity, there is no substitute for robust standards.\n\nResearchers have alleged that many projects certified by major independent standards, such as Verra and Gold Standard, [exaggerate their achievements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-21/top-carbon-offset-registries-are-failing-to-stop-junk-credits#xj4y7vzkg) and may even harm local communities; there are records of people being [removed from their homes](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/forest-communities-alto-mayo-peru-carbon-offsetting-aoe) by developers claiming to be protecting forests. The industry is trying to fix this. Most prominently, a civil society and private sector coalition known as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market has been defining \u201ccore carbon principles\u201d, or [benchmark rules](https://icvcm.org/the-core-carbon-principles/), for credits and the certifying bodies themselves. Receiving a mixed reception for its first release, the framework does [require improvement](https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2023/03/30/integrity-councils-new-carbon-market-rules-offer-improvements-but-dont-close-all-loopholes/) on key issues including clarifying credit beneficiaries and non-carbon impacts. Following its release of the full framework at the end of July, the group aims to make decisions on certain credits it deems consistent with its principles by COP28 at the end of this year.\n\nPrivate carbon credit ratings agencies, such as [Sylvera](https://www.sylvera.com/ratings), [Be Zero](https://bezerocarbon.com/ratings/) and [Calyx Global](https://calyxglobal.com/approach/), can provide an extra layer of scrutiny to certified credits. Whereas certification is a binary test, ratings reveal variations in quality and can highlight areas that need improvement. For example, while clean cookstove projects are likely to be additional and substantially improve people\u2019s quality of life, carbon credits from these projects probably [overstate emission reductions](https://calyxglobal.com/blog-post/?q=18). Civil society groups have also made extra efforts to shore up credit quality, including the [Carbon Credit Quality Initiative](https://carboncreditquality.org/scores.html) and [Tropical Forest Credit Integrity Guide](https://tfciguide.org/), developed by NGOs in collaboration with Indigenous people\u2019s groups.\n\n![Man in red using a mobile phone to take a photograph of a barcode on a tree sapling, woman in blue holding the label](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)Organisations that restore forests like this degraded peatland in Indonesia\u2019s Riau province can sell carbon credits to companies and individuals, who can then claim responsibility for the removal of emissions via naturally stored carbon (Image:\u00a0[Aris Sanjaya](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cifor/40880703343/in/album-72157680398612898/)\u00a0/\u00a0[CIFOR](https://www.flickr.com/people/cifor/),\u00a0[CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/))Demand, the second plank of integrity, hinges on how buyers use credits. Critics fear that the VCM might discourage buyers from making deeper cuts to their own emissions elsewhere. In fact, [industry](https://www.forest-trends.org/publications/the-bottom-line/) [studies](https://www.sylvera.com/resources/carbon-credits-and-decarbonization) over the years have suggested that companies buying credits tend to surpass peers on other aspects of climate performance. However, the [overall effects are complex](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/living-with-uncertainty-in-carbon-markets/) and also involve uncertain changes in behaviour. For instance, when consumers hear that products, from plane tickets to cans of beer, are \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d, it might make them feel okay about buying more overall.\n\nIn other words, the marketing claims made by buyers of carbon credits are crucial \u2013 and the current landscape is [uneven and poorly understood](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202200158). Considering the variety and range in quality of credits, what matters most is that buyers\u2019 claims fairly reflect their contribution to global climate mitigation and development. To ensure this, complementary coalitions are working on the demand-side problem. In June, the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative [published a \u2018code of practice\u2019](https://vcmintegrity.org/vcmi-claims-code-of-practice/) for marketing claims. The Science Based Targets initiative, a leading standard for net-zero commitments, has been [consulting on broader guidance](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/beyond-value-chain-mitigation) for how companies can responsibly invest in climate mitigation beyond the scope of their own targets. Companies are also increasingly at risk of legal action for misrepresenting their climate impact, especially through claims to carbon neutrality \u2013 such as that of [Delta Air Lines](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/delta-air-lines-lawsuit-carbon-neutrality-aoe), the largest buyer in the VCM over recent years.\n\n[![View of a misty rainforest](https://cdn.chinadialogue.net/content/uploads/2023/08/02095657/Misty-rainforest-carbon-offsets_Alamy_2PANBH4-1-300x199.jpg)RecommendedCan new tech make carbon offsets trustworthy?](https://chinadialogue.net/en/business/can-new-tech-make-carbon-offsets-trustworthy/)Finally, a VCM with integrity requires end-to-end transparency to understand how the benefits are distributed to people and the planet; the journey from issuance to use is just as important as the credit itself. Historically, many companies have purchased carbon credits from specialised brokers. However, some marketplaces now provide [reference contracts](https://xpansiv.com/geo/) based on bundles of similar credits, such as protecting [similar ecosystems](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/research-centres/centre-climate-finance-investment/research/forestry-backed-assets-design/) in different countries. A [trade-off](https://bezerocarbon.com/insights/carbon-isnt-just-another-commodity-market/) emerges: treating credits as standardised financial commodities makes the market easier to access, but could disincentivise developers to improve quality because special benefits, like supporting biodiversity, won\u2019t be recognised.\n\nMany additional \u201cintermediary\u201d actors are involved in providing the infrastructure required for credits to reach buyers. In general, this [intermediation in the VCM](https://carbonmarketwatch.org/publications/analysis-of-voluntary-carbon-market-stakeholders-and-intermediaries/) is fragmented and opaque. Hidden fees within credit transactions make it hard to tell the actual amount that is [invested in the climate and local communities](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/africa-focus-winter-2022-credit-where-credits-due). [Financial regulators](https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD718.pdf) are paying [closer attention](https://www.afm.nl/en/sector/actueel/2023/april/jaarverslag-2022) to the VCM, and public oversight of trading practices could shine a light on where intermediaries are claiming unjustly high shares of revenues.\n\nPolicy and the Paris Agreement\n------------------------------\n\nThe VCM doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. The United Nations framework, chiefly the Paris Agreement, provides [essential context](https://www.cliffordchance.com/expertise/services/esg/esg-insights/voluntary-carbon-market-decarbonisation.html) by setting global climate goals. However, the VCM reflects a\u00a0[policy failure](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-emissions-gaps/), as voluntary action wouldn\u2019t be needed if governments were doing enough towards those goals. It is also a front in a wider struggle for sustainable development and climate justice, particularly for global south countries that [haven\u2019t received](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3) what they were promised in [international finance](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/finance-for-climate-action-scaling-up-investment-for-climate-and-development/) by global north governments.\n\nThe UN created its own mechanisms for carbon trading under [Article 6 of the Paris Agreement](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/article-6-and-its-glasgow-rulebook-the-basics/). Key differences between the UN\u2019s mechanisms and the VCM are participation by governments and the certification of carbon credits by the UN, rather than by independent standard bodies. Governments have [obligations](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/paris-climate-agreement-legally-binding/) under the Paris Agreement to submit their own [decarbonisation commitments and plans](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs) and to [keep and report](https://unfccc.int/enhanced-transparency-framework) national inventories of emissions.\n\nArticle 6 mechanismsArticle 6.2 allows national governments to forge agreements directly, whereby they can invest in decarbonisation in another country and claim credit for emissions reductions.\n\nArticle 6.4, by contrast, creates a centralised marketplace with methodologies for issuing carbon credits established by a \u2018Supervisory Body\u2019.\n\nThis muddies the waters for the VCM, because if two countries claimed responsibility for the same emissions reductions, it would undermine climate action. The rulebook for Article 6 requires countries that authorise the transfer of emissions reductions to buyers abroad to make a \u201ccorresponding adjustment\u201d in their own accounting. In contrast, credit sales through the VCM don\u2019t technically need such adjustments, but some participants are preparing to [seek authorisation](https://www.goldstandard.org/blog-item/implementing-article-6-overview-preparations-selected-countries) by host governments anyway, and many observers believe buyers\u2019 claims should reflect whether or not they are using credits with adjustments.\n\n![carbon dioxide removal technology: direct air capture fans on roof](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)Machines at a Climeworks facility in Switzerland suck 135kg of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each day. The company\u00a0[says](https://climeworks.com/direct-air-capture)\u00a0its carbon removal credits are \u201cradically different from trading avoided emissions\u201d. (Image: Orjan Ellingvag / Alamy)Governments have options. [\u201cAccess strategies\u201d](https://vcmintegrity.org/vcm-access-strategy-toolkit/) to attract international finance through carbon markets, such as the regional approach taken by the [African Carbon Markets Initiative](https://chinadialogue.net/en/climate/can-carbon-markets-help-africa-meet-its-climate-financing-goals/), could include tracking credits, creating supportive policy environments for projects and marketplaces, or requiring a form of [legal approval](https://www.goldstandard.org/sites/default/files/documents/carbon_credit_rights_under_the_paris_agreement_november_2022.pdf) that stops short of authorisation. Full authorisation means foregoing the right to claim emissions reductions in their territory, but gaining greater control of the market. On the demand side, governments can regulate company claims, require certain kinds of information in disclosures, or allow the use of credits in domestic emissions trading systems (see the \u2018Carbon markets: voluntary or mandatory?\u2019 box above).\n\nSo far, the result is a [patchwork of national policies](https://bezerocarbon.com/insights/how-is-government-regulation-shaping-the-voluntary-carbon-market/) for international carbon markets. [Indonesia](https://carboncredits.com/indonesia-government-confirm-carbon-projects-suspension/), [Honduras](https://www.rainforestcoalition.org/country-news/honduras-imposes-moratorium-on-voluntary-credits/) and [Papua New Guinea](https://news.mongabay.com/2022/04/png-suspends-new-carbon-deals-scrambles-to-write-rules-for-the-schemes/) froze exports of forestry credits in 2022. [China](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/050823-chinas-domestic-voluntary-carbon-market-reboot-to-shake-up-global-offsets-trade) has relaunched its own certification scheme and registry to sell credits both domestically and internationally. And in May 2023, [Zimbabwe](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2023-05-17-zimbabwe-plans-takeover-of-carbon-credit-trade-voids-past-deals/) caused a stir by claiming\u00a050% of revenue from future credit sales, setting benchmarks for shares for foreign and domestic investors, and nullifying all existing agreements. Overall, action by governments may lead the global trade in credits to fragment from a global marketplace into a series of localised voluntary carbon markets.\n\nImportantly, however, governments are far from the only relevant beneficiaries for sustainable development. [Indigenous peoples](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/03/28/carbon-credit-rule-makers-must-engage-indigenous-people/) are key for their [stewardship of natural ecosystems](https://climatefocus.com/publications/sink-or-swim-how-indigenous-and-community-lands-can-make-or-break-nationally-determined/), and often need financial and policy support to defend their territorial rights against extractive corporations. Carbon markets could also give [women](https://www.sddirect.org.uk/resource/integrating-gender-lens-voluntary-carbon-markets) from emerging and developing economies the opportunity to access climate finance by developing and owning their own projects \u2013 which is crucial especially given female farmers\u2019 important role in agriculture across the global south. Yet both groups are still sidelined in market institutions\u2019 decision-making and governance processes.\n\nLooking ahead\n-------------\n\nThe VCM could face [very different futures](https://about.bnef.com/blog/carbon-offset-market-could-reach-1-trillion-with-right-rules/) depending on decisions that will be made in the coming months. Factors that will work in favour of scaling the VCM include the rapid growth of corporate climate commitments, ambitious coalitions and innovative technologies driving greater transparency, and the increasing urgency of arresting [runaway global temperatures](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/global-temperatures-set-reach-new-records-next-five-years). However, unless 2023 produces workable rules with credible examples of good practice, companies might change tack and give up on the market.\n\nMany governments are likely to bring the VCM within the scope of public regulation sooner rather than later, so all climate policymakers and campaigners should familiarise themselves with voluntary markets and credits. Though imperfect, the VCM contains the seed of our most likely future: one where everyone in society has to pay for carbon emissions, because we can no longer afford them to be free.\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The voluntary carbon market (VCM) is a global trade in rights to claim responsibility for specific reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.

commodities is having the opposite desired effect.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Climate protesters outside Sempra headquarters in California](https://img.etimg.com/photo/42031747.cms)ReutersCarbon credits offer an easy way for businesses to amp up their green credentials and funnel much-needed finance into environmental projects, often in developing nations.The market for voluntary [carbon credits](/topic/carbon-credits) has been on a roll. In 2021, it grew to $2 billion, quadrupling in a year. [Boston Consulting Group](/topic/boston-consulting-group), a management consulting firm, expects it to be worth somewhere between $10 billion and $40 billion by 2030. Carbon credits offer an easy way for businesses to amp up their green credentials and funnel much-needed finance into environmental projects, often in developing nations.  \n  \nBut prices and volume have fallen since the start of the year. Nature-based carbon offsets are now trading at $1.84, having fallen 60% since the start of the year. A tough macroeconomic environment has been blamed, as well as increased public and media scrutiny.  \n ![401017464](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg \"401017464\") BloombergThe market has an inherent flaw: Carbon credits are being traded as commodities. Instead of building trust and helping scale emission offset and removal projects, this approach is having the opposite effect and enabling poor quality credits to tarnish the market.  \n  \nLet me explain. In the commodities market, a ton of coffee might get traded, swapped and traded some more, but at the end of the value chain, someone takes delivery of that ton of coffee. That holds true for everything from oranges to wheat and oil. Scammers will eventually be caught out because someone will ultimately notice a missing barrel or bushel, or discover rocks painted to look like copper.  \nBut a carbon credit representing a ton of CO2e \u2014 the \u201ce\u201d stands for equivalent, signalling it\u2019s a measure of all greenhouse gases \u2014 either not emitted or drawn down from the atmosphere and stored permanently, is never physically settled. Instead, buyers have to trust that the supplier tells the truth and is adequately monitoring their project.  \n ![401017629](https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-42031747/et-logo.jpg \"401017629\") BloombergThere\u2019s another problem: Treated as commodities, all carbon credits are also equal and fungible. A ton is a ton is a ton. \u201cIn reality, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d Niklas Kaskeala, chairman of Compensate, a nonprofit foundation doing advocacy work to reform the carbon market, tells me. The quality of carbon offsets varies immensely, arising both from the project type \u2014 removal or avoidance, afforestation or providing clean cookstoves \u2014 and the way individual projects are managed. There are multiple risks:  \n  \n![](//a.vdo.ai/core/assets/img/cross.svg)Powered By[![VDO.AI](//a.vdo.ai/core/assets/img/logo.svg)](https://vdo.ai/contact?utm_medium=video&utm_term=economictimes.indiatimes.com&utm_source=vdoai_logo)![](https://h5.vdo.ai/media_file/v-economictimes-indiatimes-v4/source/uploads/thumbnails/16902071722664be83c4c1f76.png)Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardMuteCurrent Time\u00a00:00/Duration\u00a00:00Loaded: 0%Stream Type\u00a0LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time\u00a0-0:00\u00a01xPlayback RateChapters* Chapters\nDescriptions* descriptions off, selected\nCaptions* captions and subtitles off, selected\nAudio TrackPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.\n\nNo compatible source was found for this media.Beginning of dialog window.

For example, would the forest really have been cut down?\n* Permanence: How long will the emissions be stored, and how certain is that capture?\n* Sustainable development considerations: How does the project impact local communities and biodiversity?\n\nBecause the market is unregulated and completely voluntary, it\u2019s been able to get away with a lack of scrutiny. That\u2019s starting to change. The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, an independent regulator, has published its [Core Carbon Principles](/topic/core-carbon-principles) benchmark, a set of 10 standards defining high-quality credits. The ICVCM won\u2019t be assessing individual projects for how they align with the principles and associated assessment framework; instead, it will examine the integrity of the carbon-crediting programs and the different types of carbon credit. For example, a program such as Verra, which assesses projects and issues carbon credits, will submit details to the ICVCM on how it evaluates forest-related projects. If it satisfies the new benchmark, Verra\u2019s forestry program would get a stamp of approval from the ICVCM, and all the carbon credits sold under it will be deemed high quality.  \n  \nThis approach still maintains a binary interpretation of a carbon credit \u2013 either it\u2019s a ton or it isn\u2019t \u2013 rather than embracing the inherent differences and risk factors between projects. That approach is insufficient. BeZero Carbon, a carbon-credit rating company, has assigned values to 30 projects that are eligible within CORSIA, the global program for addressing [CO2](/topic/co2) emissions from international aviation. The allocated rankings \u2014 derived from a eight-step scale encompassing grades from AAA to D that echoes how bonds are classified \u2014 range from BBB to C. Some 57% of the projects merited B ratings, which represents a low likelihood that a ton of CO2 will actually be avoided or removed. Only one CORSIA-eligible project achieved a BBB grade, which BeZero classifies as signifying a moderate chance of success; a rating of C is deemed very low.  \n  \nBecause of this lack of stratification, when a project\u2019s failings are exposed \u2014 as has happened plenty of times \u2014 the trustworthiness of the entire carbon market crumbles. There needs to be both higher standards and increased transparency. Calls for a different approach are getting louder. Kimmeridge, an activist investor, published a paper on Thursday calling for the creation of a standardised global rating system for carbon credits.  \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s getting slightly better now but there used to be no correlation between price and quality,\u201d Tommy Ricketts, the chief executive officer of BeZero Carbon, told me. \u201cFor example, there\u2019s lots of really good credits for nitrous oxide abatement which are incredibly effective, easy to model and cheap, whereas there are some other credits which might be pricier and use potentially bad calculations.\u201d The hope of imposing a global rating system is that credits with higher grades would then become more valuable. The single biggest action Ricketts would like to see is standardised disclosure across every stage of a project\u2019s life cycle, allowing all projects to be rated.  \n  \nRatings don\u2019t solve everything. There are already several companies publishing grades, and buyers are starting to take notice. But, as Compensate\u2019s Kaskeala points out, those credits still allegedly represent a ton of CO2e removed or avoided on the buyer\u2019s carbon-accounting balance sheet. So there\u2019ll need to be a mechanism to link a project rating with the carbon reduction that a project is genuinely likely to achieve.   \n  \nCompensate, which up until recently also sold credits, did so by scoring projects to make them comparable. For example, one credit from one project might be assessed to represent just 0.6 tons of CO2e. BeZero is developing a similar method to combine its ratings with a performance discount, which would then be used to adjust the credit\u2019s value on the company\u2019s balance sheet.  \n  \nTrying to force a carbon credit peg into a commodity hole opens up too many pitfalls and doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the reality of many projects on the market. It\u2019s time for the market to become more transparent.  \nDon\u2019t miss out on ET Prime stories!

CFTC and FTC Both Scrutinize Fraud in Carbon Markets | Insights | Holland & Knight", "content": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have recently and aggressively signaled their intent to ramp up enforcement activity regarding the use of carbon offsets to make environmental claims. These moves should encourage market participants to understand and evaluate the impact of agency actions on any current and planned activities to make environmental marketing claims about use of offsets.\n\n Background\n----------\n\n Carbon offsets represent carbon emission reductions or removal and are traded in either in the over\u2011the\u2011counter market or on exchanges. There are futures contracts on various types carbon offsets, many of which allow physical delivery of the offsets at settlement. The market is global and has grown to $2 billion as of 2022, with projections valuing the market at upwards of $10 billion by 2030.\n\n Offsets are a popular tool that companies use to reduce their net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and live up to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, as well as promises to consumers. By purchasing carbon offsets, businesses are typically financing renewable energy projects that remove GHG emissions from the atmosphere or avoid GHG emissions \u2013 such as commitments to preserve forests or the construction of facilities to capture carbon emissions \u2013 without being involved directly in these projects.\n\n Double Regulation of Carbon Offset Markets and Related Environmental Claims\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n For the first time since 2012, the FTC is evaluating potential updates to its Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims (Green Guides or Guides) to provide clarity to marketers labeling products or making environmental claims, including stricter guidance for marketing claims made in connection with carbon offsets.[1](#_edn1) The proposed update seeks to add more teeth to the guidance by addressing how companies link their use of offsets to claims that products or businesses are carbon-neutral, have net\u2011zero emissions, or are low\u2011carbon or carbon-negative.[2](#_edn2) Because the Guides provide the definitive interpretation of how the FTC will exercise its broad statutory authority over unfair and deceptive practices with respect to environmental claims, failure to follow the Guides may result in an increased risk of enforcement by both the FTC and its counterpart state regulators.\n\n The update to the Green Guides is happening at the same time as several actions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) signifying its increased focus on environmental markets. **Historically viewed as a futures and swaps regulator, the CFTC also has jurisdiction to bring enforcement actions for fraud and manipulation in physical commodity markets. The CFTC has turned that jurisdictional focus to environmental markets.**\n\n New Environmental Fraud Task Force: Watch for Increased Enforcement\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The CFTC recently created an Environmental Fraud Task Force to scrutinize fraud and other misconduct in regulated and voluntary carbon markets. The task force will examine, among other things, fraud with respect to the purported environmental benefits of purchased carbon offsets, as well as registrants' material misrepresentations regarding ESG products or strategies.\n\n The CFTC also issued a whistleblower alert seeking tips related to misconduct in carbon markets. The CFTC's whistleblower program offers a monetary reward, not only to the victim of the fraud, but also to company insiders and any other market participant who voluntarily provides information about violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or CFTC regulations that lead to successful enforcement.\n\n The Environmental Fraud Task Force will use the whistleblower alert as a tool to gather information to bring cases. In particular, the CFTC is interested in:\n\n * manipulative and wash trading or other violations of the CEA in carbon market futures contracts\n* fraud in the underlying spot markets related to ghost (illusory) carbon offsets listed on carbon market registries\n* double counting or other fraud related to carbon offsets\n* fraudulent statements relating to material terms of the carbon offset\n* manipulation of tokenized carbon markets\n\n The CEA gives the CFTC the far\u2011reaching authority to pursue enforcement against \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in connection with \"a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce,\" regardless of a business' intent.[3](#_edn3) And the characterizations of double counting and fraud in the whistleblower alert are incredibly broad. Under these descriptions, **the CFTC could potentially bring enforcement actions outside of the trading context**. For example, the CFTC could prosecute a project developer that uses deceptive claims in marketing offsets or a company that markets cargos of \"carbon-neutral\" crude oil. To avoid potential enforcement by both the CFTC and the FTC, businesses will need to be careful in structuring not only their trades in carbon offsets, but also in crafting their project documentation and in making marketing claims related to their use of carbon markets to offset their emissions.\n\n Double Enforcement?\n-------------------\n\n **Could both the FTC and the CFTC bring separate enforcement actions against a company for the same underlying fact pattern involving fraud in carbon markets? Right now, without further guidance from either agency, the answer is yes.**[4](#_edn4) Comments to the Green Guides illustrate that businesses are concerned about the possibility of double enforcement and recommend that the FTC consult with the CFTC and other agencies asserting jurisdiction over carbon markets.\n\n Below is a nonexclusive list of interrelated potential problems with carbon offsets that may lead to enforcement actions by the FTC or CFTC or both:\n\n * **Fraudulent Claims that Offsets Are \"Additional.\"** \"Additionality\" refers to the guarantee that a business' use of carbon offsets leads to carbon reduction actually occurring in addition to any reductions that would have occurred in a business-as-usual scenario or as required by law. Several commenters in response to the FTC's proposed update of the Green Guides responded in favor of requiring that parties using offsets demonstrate additionality, and the CFTC's whistleblower alert specifies that a fraudulent or deceptive claim about additionality in the material terms of a carbon offset constitutes misconduct that could lead to enforcement. Parties using offsets should take care to understand the actual carbon reduction or removal linked to the offset and ensure that the reduction or removal is \"additional.\"\n* **Double Counting and Ghost Credits.** The CFTC has stated that it is examining fraud in the underlying spot markets related to \"ghost credits\" (illusory offsets), as well as double counting of offsets (when the same offset is claimed by more than one entity without an additional carbon benefit). Ghost credits and double counting exist because there is currently no legal requirement that companies verify the quality of offsets used to make climate claims, although many parties are currently voluntarily verifying through bodies such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM). Comments to the Guides supported the idea that verification of the quality of offsets should be required for their use. Likewise, entities have suggested that the CFTC create a registration framework for offsets, offset registries and offset brokers and conduct greater oversight of the existing registries; however, it is not clear that these actions are within the CFTC's authority. Companies should be careful not to make marketing claims about the use of offsets to create a \"net\u2011zero\" supply chain, for example, before verifying that the offsets exist and are not being double-counted.\n* **Fraudulent Claims Related to Sustainability and ESG.** The CFTC and FTC could both potentially bring an enforcement action based on a company's fraudulent use of offsets to create a \"sustainable\" business in line with its ESG goals. The FTC asked whether it should provide specific guidance on the use of \"sustainability\" or \"sustainable\" claims, given that Guides do not currently define the terms. In response, commenters criticized some companies' current use of offsets to substantiate misleading sustainable or net\u2011zero claims. Similarly, the CFTC's new Environmental Fraud Task force will specifically look for \"material misrepresentations regarding ESG products or strategies.\"[5](#_edn5) It is difficult for companies to know when statements about sustainability and ESG in relation to carbon offset trading, projects or marketing are fraudulent because the terms are not currently defined in the Guides or by the CFTC.\n\n Conclusion\n----------\n\n The CFTC has limited resources, and the actions discussed above signify that carbon markets are an area of increased focus for the CFTC. As agency enforcement in carbon markets develops alongside the markets themselves, businesses will face increasing challenges when both trading in carbon offsets and making advertising claims based on the use of offsets. We anticipate that actions of the FTC and CFTC, among other agencies, will overlap in the carbon market space. Agency authority over carbon markets has not yet been tested in courts, although it is expected that these challenges are coming.\n\n In the meantime, businesses will need to comply with agency actions concerning carbon markets to avoid adverse enforcement consequences.

See \"[Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Delivers Remarks to the New York City Bar White Collar Crime Institute](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosenstein-delivers-remarks-new-york-city-bar-white-collar),\" May 9, 2018.\n\n [5](#_ednref5) While the CFTC was likely referring to financial products marketed as having ESG benefits, it is unclear how broadly the CFTC will apply this assertion of authority.\n\n \n\n---\n\n Information contained in this alert is for the general education and knowledge of our readers.

This blog lays out the framing, key issues, and potential solutions, with more detailed analysis available in the paper.\u00a0\n\n**To understand equity, ask the right questions**\u202f\u00a0\n\nAchieving environmental [equity](https://www.edf.org/about/equity-and-environmental-justice-edf) means ensuring that both the processes and outcomes associated with policy decisions are fair and just. Environmental benefits and burdens must be balanced. Everyone is entitled to a healthy ecosystem.\u00a0\n\nAcross academic and civil society literature, environmental equity is often framed along three dimensions: recognitional, procedural, and distributional equity. The graphic below defines these dimensions of equity and provides examples of questions that carbon market stakeholders should ask when designing and implementing crediting programs.\u00a0\n\n [![](https://blogs.edf.org/markets/wp-content/blogs.dir/32/files//Graphic-NCS-Blog-1024x442.png)](https://blogs.edf.org/markets/wp-content/blogs.dir/32/files//Graphic-NCS-Blog.png)\n\nIn the context of NCS crediting, equity questions arise on both the demand and supply side. On supply, issues include the rights and priorities of communities generating credits, benefit sharing arrangements, and stakeholder consultation processes. On demand, these include the impacts of credit use on local co-pollutants, disparities in environmental burdens, and the distribution of benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUltimately, carbon pricing and crediting is valuable only insofar as it can effectively drive climate-friendly outcomes in an equitable manner.\u00a0\n\nIn some cases, supply and demand considerations may come into tension, for instance when credit usage could exacerbate a community\u2019s air pollution on the demand side but support local livelihoods on the supply side.\u00a0\n\nThough equity should ultimately be considered holistically, this paper focuses specifically on demand, digging into the details and evidence around the use of NCS credits. EDF\u2019s forthcoming [NCS Crediting Handbook](https://www.edf.org/natural-climate-solutions-and-carbon-crediting) will include a chapter on supply side issues, including a section on safeguards for people and the environment.\u00a0\n\nIt is important to note that some environmental justice and civil rights groups fundamentally oppose carbon pricing as it [favors economic efficiency over distributional equity](https://www.weact.org/2016/09/a-climate-game-changer/) and allows pollution to be paid for. Although these critiques cannot be corrected through modifications to policy design, they should be recognized and understood.\u00a0\n\n**Using NCS credits in compliance and voluntary markets**\u202f\u00a0\n\nUnderstanding the equity questions around NCS crediting, and taking actions to address them, is necessary to avoid negative outcomes for communities.\u00a0\n\nIn some countries and jurisdictions, emitters are regulated under pricing mechanisms like cap-and-trade or carbon taxation. Companies can often use carbon credits, including NCS credits, to meet a portion of these obligations. And in many cases, the equity considerations surrounding the use of NCS credits are the same as those for the use of emissions allowances.\u00a0\n\nIn these systems, companies may choose to pay for emissions allowances or credits when these are less expensive than direct emissions reductions. Since greenhouse gas emissions are strongly correlated with harmful co-pollutants, this could potentially maintain or exacerbate inequities in pollution exposure. Polluting facilities are disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color, meaning these groups could be particularly harmed.\u00a0\n\nWhile well-designed emissions trading has been shown to reduce overall emissions in regulated areas, the evidence on local environmental impacts is mixed. Several studies using different methodologies have examined the California cap-and-trade program, finding either the exacerbation or reduction of pollution burden in predominantly minority or low-income communities. A detailed analysis of this literature is available in the full paper. Outside of the US, little research assesses the impacts of emissions trading on community air quality.\u00a0\n\nThe use of credits and allowances raises the risk of extending the lifespan of fossil fuel infrastructure, with associated public health effects. For NCS credits in particular, mitigation potential is limited by the overall availability of ecosystems, meaning this is not an indefinite solution for fossil fuels.\u00a0\n\nAs for the voluntary carbon market, NCS credits offer one option for companies to voluntarily contribute to emissions reductions. To the extent that carbon credits are used to mask unsustainable practices, this could be considered a form of \u2018greenwashing.\u2019\u00a0\n\nThese issues can and must be addressed for effective, impactful use of NCS crediting.\u00a0\n\n**Promoting equitable outcomes**\u00a0\n\nNCS credits are an important tool for financing conservation, and several policy options help to promote the equitable use of these credits. For example, compliance markets often limit the percentage of an entities\u2019 obligation that can be met with credits. Under Washington State\u2019s [cap-and-trade](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.170&pdf=true), an entity\u2019s credit allowance may be further reduced if they \u201ccontribute substantively to cumulative air pollution burden in an overburdened community.\u201d In voluntary markets, credits could be used only for contribution beyond a company\u2019s value chain.\u00a0\n\nRevenues from emissions trading can also be recycled, including through tax rebates for low-income households, income or corporate tax reductions, or funding for renewable energy and infrastructure projects. [California Senate Bill 535](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/sb535) mandates that at least a quarter of the proceeds from the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program go to projects benefiting disadvantaged communities, with at least 10 percent of funds for projects directly located in disadvantaged communities.\n\nUltimately, carbon pricing and crediting is valuable only insofar as it can effectively drive climate-friendly outcomes in an equitable manner.\u00a0\n\n*The NCS Crediting Handbook will explore other components of equity and integrity, including questions around the generation and transaction of credits.

Holdings Inc., a technology-based environmental, social, and governance (ESG) company, has made another significant stride in the world of carbon credit trading by securing a multi-year carbon credit purchase agreement with a Canadian subsidiary of a major investor-owned energy company.\u00a0\n\n\nThis groundbreaking agreement marks a pivotal moment for [DevvStream](https://www.devvstream.com/) as it reinforces its position as a leading player in carbon credit project development and generation, with a specialized emphasis on technological solutions.\n\n\nUnder this multi-year agreement, the buyer committed to purchase **250,000** [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-understanding-carbon-credits/) from DevvStream. Generation of these carbon credits would adhere to compliance programs in Alberta and British Columbia for at least 3 years. They will also be subject to meeting specific conditions like regulatory requirements in BC.\n\n\nTrading Carbon Credits in Compliance Markets\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nA critical aspect of trading carbon credits in the [compliance carbon market](https://carboncredits.com/a-guide-to-compliance-carbon-credit-markets/) is that they must align with the relevant national, regional, and international policies and legislation. DevvStream will produce the credits according to the [Technology Innovation and Emission Reduction (TIER) Regulation](https://carboncredits.com/alberta-prepares-for-too-many-carbon-credits-coming/), enacted under Alberta\u2019s Emissions Management and Climate Resilience Act.\u00a0\n\n\nThe company will also ensure alignment with British Columbia\u2019s forthcoming Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS). In case the OBPS is not yet finalized during the agreement\u2019s term, equivalent voluntary credits can be an alternative, at the buyer\u2019s discretion.\n\n\nVoluntary carbon credits are also known as [carbon offsets](https://carboncredits.com/are-carbon-offsets-a-scam-key-points-to-consider/). DevvStream also offers a range of targeted and scalable carbon offset programs (COPs) to meet the agreement\u2019s requirements. These carbon offset programs include:\n\n\n* emission reduction activities in road transportation and maintenance,\n* [buildings and facilities program](https://carboncredits.com/devvstream-bfcop-carbon-offsetting-for-buildings/),\n* energy-efficient lighting,\n* electric vehicle charging stations, and\n* [methane abatement initiatives](https://carboncredits.com/devvstream-methane-credits/) focusing on sealing orphaned oil and gas wells,\n\n\nTo ensure scalability and effectiveness, DevvStream\u2019s COPs employ the Program of Activities (PoA) approach. This model is recognized by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Applying it enables DevvStream to bundle up multiple eligible activities across predetermined jurisdictions, promoting quick deployment at scale.\n\n\nCommitting to Carbon Credit Integrity\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nSunny Trinh, DevvStream\u2019s CEO, emphasizes the company\u2019s commitment to generating top-quality carbon credits that adhere to strict environmental standards. These credits will align with the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) [Core Carbon Principles](https://carboncredits.com/the-core-carbon-principles/) and also comply with robust methodologies outlined in Canadian law.\u00a0\n\n\nTrinh further asserts that their ability to work around strict regulations showcases DevvStream\u2019s operational excellence in the carbon space.\n\n\nThe initial batch of carbon credits will be delivered by 2024, with the final delivery slated for 2026. The agreement also allows for the possibility of purchasing an additional **400,000 credits** beyond the specified period.\n\n\nThis landmark agreement highlights the surging demand for carbon offsets generated through DevvStream\u2019s diverse programs. As environmental concerns continue to take center stage, partnerships like these contribute significantly to addressing climate change while adhering to stringent compliance and quality standards.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nDisclosure: Owners, members, directors and employees of carboncredits.com have/may have stock or option position in any of the companies mentioned: DESG\n\nAdditional disclosure: This communication serves the sole purpose of adding value to the research process and is for information only.

The steel industry accounts for about\u00a0[15%](http://www.news.cn/energy/20230713/8c4570a53cfb4e129723382a14db8378/c.html)\u00a0of China\u2019s carbon emissions.\u00a0\n\n\n**EU initiative**\n-----------------\n\n\nThe authors point out that the EU\u2019s planned Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which imposes a carbon levy on certain imported emission-intensive products\u00a0means Chinese steelmakers are increasingly concerned about the extra costs they will face when exporting to the EU. An expansion of the domestic carbon market to steel would help adjust, they say.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2018Judging by the direction followed by governmental departments in recent years, and the\u00a0[views of sectoral experts](https://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-SYZW202203002.htm), the implementation programme for allocating carbon allowances in the steel industry is expected to be completed towards the end of the 14th Five Year Plan period (2021\u20132025),\u2019 says China Dialogue.\u00a0\n\n\n\u2018The coming into force of the CBAM will have a clear impact on China\u2019s steel exports and may also hasten the industry\u2019s integration into the national carbon market, to avoid the additional carbon costs associated with a lack of domestic carbon pricing.\u2019\u00a0\n\n\n**Don't hesitate to [contact us](https://recyclinginternational.com/contact/) to share your input and ideas.

The proposed Climate Act\nAmendment Bill will establish a National Carbon Registry as well as\nprovide the guiding principles governing trade in the carbon\nmarket.\n\n\nThe Carbon Trading Bill, if enacted, will be applicable to the\nfollowing carbon resources: rangelands, forests, biodiversity and\ngenetic resources, soil, public land, private land, community land,\nsurface and groundwater as well as renewable energy including wind,\nsolar and geothermal.\n\n\nThe Carbon Trading Bill proposes:\n\n\n* the introduction of **carbon trading permits** for\npersons intending to carry on carbon credit trading business in\neither the voluntary carbon market or the carbon compliance market.\nCarbon credit trading business under the Carbon Trading Bill\nincludes the business of operating a carbon trading exchange\n* the introduction of **benefit sharing ratios**\nbetween the stakeholders ie, the Carbon Trading and Benefit Sharing\nAuthority, national government, county government, community and\nthe proponent for the various types of carbon resources\n* the establishment of a **Carbon Credit Trading\nRegister** for carbon credit trading permits, carbon credit\ntrading project, community development and benefit sharing\nagreements as well as carbon credit trading purchase\nagreements\n* the introduction of **greenwashing offences**\n\u2013 it will be an offence to make: a) false statements in the\nrequired environmental and social impact assessment and b) false\nrepresentations or concealment of material facts to procure or\nattempt to procure a carbon credit trading permit\n* the establishment of a **Carbon Trading and Benefit\nSharing Authority** which will be mandated to issue carbon\ntrading permits, provide policy direction and guidance to both\nlevels of governments on carbon credit trading business, regulate\ncarbon credit trading business in Kenya, ensure fair and equitable\nsharing of benefits among stakeholders, ensure development of\ninvestor protection standards with respect to carbon credit trading\nbusiness, and promote the development of the carbon credit trading\nsector in Kenya\n* the establishment of a **Carbon Credit Trading\nTribunal** with jurisdiction over disputes arising out of\nregulatory functions under the Carbon Trading Bill, with all\ndisputes arising from carbon credit trading operations under a\ncarbon credit trading agreement being referred to alternative\ndispute resolution mechanisms in the first instance and thereafter\nto arbitration in accordance with the United Nations Commission on\nInternational Trade Law Arbitration Rules\n\n\nThe draft Carbon Trading Bill, as currently drafted, does not\nhave any transitional clauses and does not sufficiently address\nexisting carbon finance projects or existing carbon trading\nagreements in Kenya. We would not expect the Carbon Trading Bill if\nenacted to apply retroactively, however, the parties to such\nagreements may require to align their carbon trading activities to\nensure regulatory compliance.\n\n\nWe note that there may be some areas of overlap between the\nproposed Carbon Trading Bill and the proposed Climate Act Amendment\nBill, particularly as regards the content of community development\nand benefit-sharing agreements, and the proposed benefit-sharing\nratios. However, we note that the Carbon Trading Bill is at the\nearly stages of the legislative process and may be subject to major\nrevisions. Possibly, the legislators may see it fit to have the\nprovisions of the Carbon Trading Bill and the Climate Act Amendment\nBill enacted as an omnibus amendment to the Climate Change Act\nNo.11 of 2016 to avoid any contradictory legislation.\n\n\nCarbon finance and carbon markets in Kenya currently operate in\na legal lacuna, with some uncertainty. For instance, according to\nrecent media reports, the Kajiado County Governor, in June 2023, [issued a notice](https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/kajiado/lenku-quashes-opaque-deals-on-carbon-credits-4260672) revoking all carbon credit\ncontracts between private entities and local communities in Kajiado\nCounty in Kenya. However, in light of the principle of privity of\ncontract, the efficacy of such notice may be questionable.\nHopefully, the Carbon Trading Bill and the Climate Act Amendment\nBill will address investor concerns and formalise carbon credits as\na commodity in Kenya.\n\n\n*The content of this article is intended to provide a general\nguide to the subject matter.

Every week it feels like there is a [new](https://verra.org/verra-releases-food-loss-and-waste-methodology/) [methodology](https://verra.org/verra-reaches-key-milestones-in-finalizing-new-redd-methodology/) coming out to verify a different version of a carbon offset project or the [birth of an organization promising to overhaul](https://www.wsj.com/articles/independent-group-stakes-out-position-as-arbiter-of-carbon-offset-quality-20794a5c) the credibility of the market.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a corporation looking to fund carbon removal investment or avoidance of emissions, it can feel overwhelming to know what is significant and worthwhile or what is greenwashing and should be avoided. And while there isn\u2019t one standard or organization to rule them all, corporations will have to wade through the confusing landscape.\n\n\nHere are the organizations that are important in the voluntary carbon market and what they do.\n\n\n### Integrity initiatives\n\n\n##### Voluntary Carbon Market Integrity Initiative (VCMI)\n\n\nAn integrity initiative is an organization working to improve the quality, accuracy and credibility of credits and claims that swirl around the carbon market. The [VCMI](https://vcmintegrity.org/) was started in March 2021 with the goal to bring confidence to carbon credit purchasing for corporations. The VCMI addresses the demand side of carbon credits, a.k.a. corporations. The organization creates guidance that will advise companies how to buy high quality credits that are making a positive climate impact.\u00a0\n\n\nSo far the organization has released its [Claims Code of Practice](https://vcmintegrity.org/publication_category/claims-code/) for buying credits, its [Access Strategies Toolkit](https://vcmintegrity.org/publication_category/access-strategies/) for countries engaging in the voluntary carbon market, [Criteria for Voluntary Carbon Market Claims](https://vcmintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Criteria-for-Voluntary-Carbon-Markets-Related-Claims.pdf) and other [white papers, proposals and feedback](https://vcmintegrity.org/publications/).\u00a0\n\n\nThe VCMI is headed by Mark Kenber, executive director. He is the former CEO of The Climate Group and a board member of ICVCM and Verra (explained below). It\u2019s steering committee includes Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, Tuntiak Katan Jua, a native of the Ecuadorian Amazon town of Shuar and a leader in indigenous rights and Usha Rao-Monari, under secretary-general and associate administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). It\u2019s expert advisors include representatives from KPMG, Unilever, CDP and the High Tide Foundation.\u00a0\n\n\n##### Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM)\n\n\nTo add to the alphabet soup is the [ICVCM](https://icvcm.org/), also formed in 2021, which addresses the supply side of the carbon credits world. The organization focuses on creating guidance and rules for carbon crediting projects and project developers to ensure fulfilled additionality, durability and leakage requirements (read more about those in [this GreenBiz 101](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/quest-carbon-offsets-almost-anything-goes) on offsets).\u00a0\n\n\nThe organization published its 10 [Core Carbon Principles](https://icvcm.org/the-core-carbon-principles/) and a program-level assessment procedure in April as global benchmarks for evaluating high integrity carbon credits. Projects that adhere to these principles can retain ICVCM\u2019s stamp of approval when it credits go to market.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Integrity Council consists of 22 board members including chair Annette L. Nazareth, who has a background in law and financial service. Among the other 21 is Sonja Gibbs, leaders of the Institute of International Finance\u2019s work on sustainable finance and debt policy; Carl Wesselink, director of South South North (SSN), where he oversees a portfolio of climate related programs; and Michael Hugman, director of Climate Finance at the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation.\u00a0\n\n\n### Carbon credit registries\n\n\n##### Verra\n\n\n[Verra](https://verra.org/) is one of the best known names in the voluntary carbon market space since it began in 2007. The nonprofit is a leader in setting the standards \u2014 creating methodologies and verifying carbon offset projects around the world. When companies buy credits, many of them will be verified and certified using Verra\u2019s standards. Verra has [methodologies](https://verra.org/methodologies-main/) on everything from improved forest management to fuel switching.\u00a0\n\n\nThe organization works with governments, businesses, project developers and third party verifiers to ensure the credibility of the carbon credit projects. Potential projects submit answers to questionnaires, as well as undergo a third party verification visit to confirm claims. It also runs a carbon crediting registry which is a central repository for retiring and transferring carbon credits and keeping track of how many tons of carbon a project has removed or avoided from the atmosphere.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s headed by CEO Judith Simon; previously vice president of Zillow group, Farhan Ahmend; chief program office coming from Fair Trade; and chief program development and innovation officer Tony Janson Smith; who has decades of experience creating standards for environmental policies.\u00a0\n\n\n##### The Gold Standard\n\n\n[The Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/) is the other common name when it comes to carbon registries and methodologies. Founded in 2003, Verra\u2019s direct competitor also creates standards and methodologies for carbon crediting projects regarding everything from accelerated carbonation of concrete to animal manure management of biogas. Its [impact registry](https://www.goldstandard.org/resources/impact-registry) is publicly available to track the environmental assets (a.k.a. carbon credits) of its customers.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Gold Standard is led by Margaret N. Kim as CEO from 2019. She came to The Gold Standard from Green Climate Fund Liaison in the Office of Director-General for the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI).\u00a0\n\n\n##### The American Carbon Registry\n\n\nThe third in this row of carbon crediting bodies is [The American Carbon Registry (ACR).](https://americancarbonregistry.org/) Founded in 1996, it was actually the first private voluntary greenhouse gas registry. Mary Grady, president and CEO, has been at ACR for 15 years. She oversaw the ACR\u2019s involvement in historic environmental policies such as CORSIA and the California Offset Project Registry.\u00a0\n\n\nThe ACR is also developing and approving new methodologies for creating carbon credits. Earlier this year, ACR approved a [carbon crediting methodology](https://americancarbonregistry.org/news-events/program-announcements/acr-approves-first-of-a-kind-carbon-crediting-methodology-for-plugging-orphaned-oil-and-gas-oog-wells) for plugging abandoned oil and gas wells. The organization is also heavily involved in California\u2019s cap-and-trade offset program to oversee and verify the state\u2019s offset projects.\u00a0\n\n\n##### Puro.Earth\n\n\nWhile Verra, Gold Standard and the ACR work on both removals and avoided, [Puro.Earth](https://puro.earth/) has put all of its focus behind removals. Like the three above, the organization has its own registry and standards \u2014 but only for carbon removals. It focuses mostly on engineered carbon removals, not nature-based solutions, and has [methodologies](https://puro.earth/carbon-removal-methods/) for [biochar](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/seven-biochar-companies-you-should-know), [enhanced rock weathering,](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/effective-climate-change-solution-may-lie-rocks-beneath-our-feet) [woody biomass](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/deceptively-simple-technology-carbon-removal) and others.\u00a0\n\n\nPuro.Earth was founded in 2018 and acquired by Nasdaq in 2021. It used to have a marketplace where buyers and sellers could meet and make transactions but that was discontinued in 2022. Unlike the other registries, it is a private corporation.\u00a0\n\n\nThe company created the CO2 Removal Certificate (CORC) that independently verifies when one metric ton of CO2 has been removed and durably sequestered from the atmosphere. It also created the CORC Index to track the price of sequestered carbon, since prices in the carbon market are famously opaque and don\u2019t always follow common sense economic principles.\u00a0\n\n\nThe CEO and founder is Antti Vihavainen, with Marianne Tikkanen as head of carbon crediting programs.\u00a0\n\n\n##### Others\n\n\nThere are many other smaller registries trying to compete with the big boys, or simply carving out more specific niches. This includes the likes of [Isometric](https://isometric.com/), while others, such as [The Climate Action Reserve](https://www.climateactionreserve.org/), have been on the market for a while.\n\n\n### Rating agencies\n\n\n##### Calyx Global\n\n\nRating agencies are another tool the voluntary market is using to try to add credibility in an uncertain world of offsets. [Calyx](https://calyxglobal.com/) was founded by Donna Lee, a former consultant, and Ducan van Bergen, previously a vice president of nature-based solutions at Shell.\u00a0\n\n\nThe online platform lets investors, companies and other buyers look up a project\u2019s score to see the impact that project is making on removing carbon from the atmosphere. These can help companies avoid bad projects and focus on the good ones. The company has worked with partners such as GHG Management Institute, Climate Law and Policy, Climate Focus and Carbon Limits to develop its ratings approach.\u00a0\n\n\n##### BeZero Carbon\n\n\n[Another ratings platform](https://bezerocarbon.com/) that starts with a risk assessment on the project\u2019s sector and geography. The ratings system uses satellites to monitor the projects in real time and divides them based on different sub-sector metrics, such as cookstove projects versus landfill gas projects.\u00a0\n\n\nFounded in April 2020, the team consists of Ph. Ds, geospatial experts and ratings professionals. Tommy Rickets, former vice president of Merril Lynch, is CEO and founder. Mani Gangadharan Venketachalam joined as president in 2022 \u200b\u200bafter leaving the same position at Crisil, a global ratings and analytics company and part of S&P Global, and was previously the CEO of Moody\u2019s Analytics Knowledge Services.\n\n\n##### Sylvera\n\n\nProbably the [best known name](https://www.sylvera.com/) in the carbon credits rating world is Sylvera. Started in 2019 by Allister Furey and Sam Gill, the two have gotten Salesforce, Shell, Boston Consulting Group, Mitsubishi, Bain and many others as Sylvera clients.\n\n\nTouting machine learning and proprietary data, Sylvera supposedly gives the best analysis of carbon credits in the sector. Currently, Sylvera is rating the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), afforestation, reforestation and revegetation (ARR), improved forest management (IFM) and renewable energy source (RES) projects.\n\n\nThe rating assesses the likelihood that the credits issued by a carbon project have delivered on their claims of avoiding or removing one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The company also includes co-benefits into their calculation like biodiversity and water quality improvements.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Voluntary Carbon Market Integrity Initiative (VCMI) and the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) are organizations working to improve the quality and credibility of carbon credits and claims in the voluntary carbon market.

TECH TUESDAY is produced in collaboration with Nasdaq.**\n\n\nSupported by\u00a0[marketplace technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/marketplace-services-platform/carbon-credit-exchanges)\u00a0that boosts institutional confidence, carbon markets can continue to develop and grow. Traders Magazine spoke with\u00a0[Gerard Smith](https://www.nasdaq.com/authors/gerard-smith),\u00a0Vice President, Head of Product- Digital Assets & Carbon at Nasdaq\u2019s Marketplace Technology business, about the current landscape and the outlook for future, both globally and in the key region of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\u00a0\n\n\n**What is the current state of play for carbon trading and markets globally?**\n\n\n\n![](https://www.tradersmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/14-kopiera.jpg)Gerard Smith, Nasdaq\nOne issue is the fragmentation of markets. Another issue that is hampering these markets is that there\u2019s little to no consistency between jurisdictions on how carbon credits are considered legally \u2013 some jurisdictions consider carbon credits as an expense, some think about it as an asset, some think about it as a commodity. And depending on the legal structure around those assets, that has a knock-on impact with respect to how they\u2019re treated from a tax perspective and an accounting perspective. So that\u2019s one barrier to participation in these markets, especially if you\u2019re thinking about them from a global perspective.\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest issue is a lack of liquidity, due to a lack of supply. The whole concept of carbon markets is to channel capital into projects \u2013 whether it be forestation, solar, or direct air capture of carbon \u2013\u00a0through market mechanisms. The investments channeled into those projects are what create the credits in the first place. Therefore the lack of supply of credits should be addressed as other barriers to market participation are addressed.\n\n\n**Has market infrastructure kept up with the emergence / growth of carbon markets? Where are the gaps?**\n\n\nThe growth of carbon markets has been significant, and it should become more significant as more corporates set net-zero targets and must purchase credits to meet those targets. Right now, a lot of corporates tend to buy the credits and then retire them, so there isn\u2019t a great deal of secondary market activity. This causes a problem with price transparency, which in itself can be a problem for the growth of these markets.\n\n\nAnother gap is a lack of intermediaries in the market. There is some custodian bank and broker activity, but lots of banks come to us and say they have clients who are interested in buying credits, but they would prefer for their banking and custody partners to deal with the sourcing, purchase, custody and retirement process on their behalf, i.e they want someone to take that pain away. So more participation of intermediaries, custodians, and brokers especially, would generate more secondary market activity and more institutionalization of these markets.\n\n\n**How can FMIs (Financial Market Infrastructures) such as Nasdaq support the development of carbon markets?**\n\n\nWe are seeing some FMIs, who typically act as the local exchange in a particular jurisdiction with clearing and settlement facilities, beginning to become interested and step into carbon markets. Sometimes that\u2019s because the local government has asked them to set up a carbon trading facility for that country.\u00a0\n\n\nThe alternative to that is a growth of global marketplaces that tend to be driven by startup companies.\u00a0\n\n\nIt will be easier for FMIs to step into carbon markets when there\u2019s more clarity around legality, regulation, tax, etc. So in the short term, the main goals for FMIs will be to seek more clarity around some of those aspects, before they dive fully into facilitating those markets.\u00a0\n\n\n**As an area susceptible to climate change impacts, why is MENA an ideal staging ground for the growth and maturation of carbon markets?**\n\n\nFor one, the Middle East has seen incredible development of their capital markets, especially over the past 20 years. Looking at UAE or Saudi Arabia for example, they have sophisticated capital markets infrastructure in terms of exchanges, clearing, settlement, and risk management, so they are well-placed to take on a new asset class like carbon.\n\n\nSecond, most countries in the Middle East are big producers of oil and natural gas. Thereare many projects in the Middle East that can capture the carbon emissions from oil and gas production, and actually create carbon credits from avoiding what they would have emitted otherwise.\n\n\nAnd third, the Middle East is a place where you can find vast amounts of capital. Deploying that capital from the Middle East into projects, especially in the global south, is an important route for capital to get into the projects in the first place. So, you see capital from the Middle East finds its way into places like Africa, where you can fund and invest in these projects to create the offsets that they need in the Middle East, or as an alternative to their own carbon capture and storage projects.\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, the channeling of capital to projects in the global south can also assist with sustainable development goals.\n\n\n**What do you see for the future of carbon trading and markets, both in MENA and globally?**\n\n\nWe are likely to see many more corporates making net-zero commitments, which means that demand for carbon credits will grow. That\u2019s good for voluntary carbon markets, because increased prices would make more projects viable in terms of being able to sell the credits they produce. That should bring more supply onstream over time.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also likely to be more regulation, institutionalization and legal clarity. That\u2019s a good thing, because people need to understand how to deal with carbon as an asset class.\n\n\nFinally, there\u2019s something in the Paris Agreement called Article 6.4, which makes it possible for countries to enter into an agreement with each other to trade emissions. So if the UK has a target of reducing emissions by 10, but they\u2019ve only managed to reduce them by 8, they can go and find the other two from another country that they have an agreement with. It\u2019s not yet fully understood how this mechanism for cross-border trading of carbon credits will work in relation to voluntary carbon markets, but as the framework becomes more operational, that should stimulate the market.\u00a0\n\n\n*Creating tomorrow\u2019s markets today.

In 2021, it grew to US$2bil, quadrupling in a year.\n\n Boston Consulting Group, a management consulting firm, expects it to be worth somewhere between US$10bil and US$40bil by 2030.\n\n Carbon credits offer an easy way for businesses to amp up their green credentials and funnel much-needed finance into environmental projects, often in developing nations.\n\n But prices and volume have fallen since the start of the year.\n\n\n\n Nature-based carbon offsets are now trading at US$1.84, having fallen 60% since the start of the year.\n\n A tough macroeconomic environment has been blamed, as well as increased public and media scrutiny.\n\n **Losing value**\n\n\n\n[![](https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2023/08/08/thumbs/small/2219652.jpg)](https://www.thestar.com.my/starpicks/2023/08/08/advancing-new-energy-vehicle-technologies)\n\n\n\n[StarPicks](/starpicks)\n\n\n[Advancing new energy vehicle technologies](https://www.thestar.com.my/starpicks/2023/08/08/advancing-new-energy-vehicle-technologies)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n The market has an inherent flaw: Carbon credits are being traded as commodities. Instead of building trust and helping scale emission offset and removal projects, this approach is having the opposite effect and enabling poor quality credits to tarnish the market.\n\n Let me explain.\n\n In the commodities market, a tonne of coffee might get traded, swapped and traded some more, but at the end of the value chain, someone takes delivery of that tonne of coffee.\n\n That holds true for everything from oranges to wheat and oil. Scammers will eventually be caught out because someone will ultimately notice a missing barrel or bushel, or discover rocks painted to look like copper.\n\n But a carbon credit representing a tonne of CO2e \u2013 the \u201ce\u201d stands for equivalent, signalling it\u2019s a measure of all greenhouse gases \u2013 either not emitted or drawn down from the atmosphere and stored permanently, is never physically settled.\n\n Instead, buyers have to trust that the supplier tells the truth and is adequately monitoring their project.\n\n **Growing market**\n\n Growth in the number of carbon credits being issued per year slowed down in 2022.\n\n There\u2019s another problem: Treated as commodities, all carbon credits are also equal and fungible.\n\n A tonne is a tonne is a tonne.\u201cIn reality, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d Niklas Kaskeala, chairman of Compensate, a non-profit foundation doing advocacy work to reform the carbon market, tells me.\n\n The quality of carbon offsets varies immensely, arising both from the project type \u2013 removal or avoidance, afforestation or providing clean cook stoves \u2013 and the way individual projects are managed. There are multiple risks:\n\n > Accounting: How accurately can the project calculate how much CO2e has been avoided or removed from the atmosphere?\n\n > Additionality: Would the emissions be avoided or removed without the purchase of the credit? For example, would the forest really have been cut down?\n\n > Permanence: How long will the emissions be stored, and how certain is that capture?\n\n > Sustainable development considerations: How does the project impact local communities and biodiversity?\n\n Because the market is unregulated and completely voluntary, it\u2019s been able to get away with a lack of scrutiny. That\u2019s starting to change.\n\n The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), an independent regulator, has published its Core Carbon Principles benchmark, a set of 10 standards defining high-quality credits.\n\n The ICVCM won\u2019t be assessing individual projects for how they align with the principles and associated assessment framework; instead, it will examine the integrity of the carbon-crediting programmes and the different types of carbon credit.\n\n For example, a programme such as Verra, which assesses projects and issues carbon credits, will submit details to the ICVCM on how it evaluates forest-related projects.\n\n If it satisfies the new benchmark, Verra\u2019s forestry programme would get a stamp of approval from the ICVCM, and all the carbon credits sold under it will be deemed high quality.\n\n This approach still maintains a binary interpretation of a carbon credit \u2013 either it\u2019s a tonne or it isn\u2019t \u2013 rather than embracing the inherent differences and risk factors between projects. That approach is insufficient.\n\n BeZero Carbon, a carbon-credit rating company, has assigned values to 30 projects that are eligible within Corsia, the global programme for addressing CO2 emissions from international aviation.\n\n The allocated rankings \u2013 derived from a eight-step scale encompassing grades from AAA to D that echoes how bonds are classified \u2013 range from BBB to C.\n\n Some 57% of the projects merited B ratings, which represents a low likelihood that a tonne of CO2 will actually be avoided or removed. Only one Corsia-eligible project achieved a BBB grade, which BeZero classifies as signifying a moderate chance of success; a rating of C is deemed very low.\n\n Because of this lack of stratification, when a project\u2019s failings are exposed \u2013 as has happened plenty of times \u2013 the trustworthiness of the entire carbon market crumbles.\n\n There needs to be both higher standards and increased transparency. Calls for a different approach are getting louder.\n\n Kimmeridge, an activist investor, published a paper last Thursday calling for the creation of a standardised global rating system for carbon credits.\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s getting slightly better now but there used to be no correlation between price and quality,\u201d Tommy Ricketts, the chief executive officer of BeZero Carbon, told me.\n\n \u201cFor example, there\u2019s lots of really good credits for nitrous oxide abatement which are incredibly effective, easy to model and cheap, whereas there are some other credits which might be pricier and use potentially bad calculations.\u201d\n\n The hope of imposing a global rating system is that credits with higher grades would then become more valuable. The single biggest action Ricketts would like to see is standardised disclosure across every stage of a project\u2019s life cycle, allowing all projects to be rated.\n\n Ratings don\u2019t solve everything. There are already several companies publishing grades, and buyers are starting to take notice. But, as Compensate\u2019s Kaskeala points out, those credits still allegedly represent a tonne of CO2e removed or avoided on the buyer\u2019s carbon-accounting balance sheet.\n\n So there\u2019ll need to be a mechanism to link a project rating with the carbon reduction that a project is genuinely likely to achieve. Compensate, which up until recently also sold credits, did so by scoring projects to make them comparable.\n\n For example, one credit from one project might be assessed to represent just 0.6 tonnes of CO2e.\n\n BeZero is developing a similar method to combine its ratings with a performance discount, which would then be used to adjust the credit\u2019s value on the company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\n Trying to force a carbon credit peg into a commodity hole opens up too many pitfalls and doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the reality of many projects on the market. It\u2019s time for the market to become more transparent. \u2014 Bloomberg\n\n Lara Williams is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering climate change.

Specifically, this entity, among other things, allegedly contravened the *Emission Management Act* by providing false information and lacked the necessary qualifications to provide their verification service.\n\n\n**Compliance Obligations**\n\n\nTIER, which is enacted under the *Emission Management Act*, implements Alberta's industrial carbon pricing and emissions trading system and regulates: (i) facilities that emit 100,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide per year; (ii) facilities that emit 2,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide per year and have voluntarily opted-in to TIER; or (iii) owners or operators of two or more conventional oil and gas facilities, who have applied to have their facility regulated by TIER (each a **Regulated Facility**).\n\n\nTIER prescribes a \u201cperson responsible\u201d for each Regulated Facility, and requires such person to submit annual compliance reports, detailing how the Regulated Facility has met its greenhouse gas (**GHG**) emission reduction requirements required by TIER.\n\n\nSuch GHG emission reduction requirements can be achieved in a number of ways including: (i) physically abating GHG emissions from such Regulated Facility; (ii) submitting emission offsets (**Emission Offsets**); (iii) submitting emission performance credits (**EPCs**); (iv) converting Emission Offsets into sequestration credits (**Sequestration Credits**) and then submitting them; (v) purchasing fund credits (**Fund Credits**) by paying into a TIER fund at an annual per tonne price prescribed by TIER (which, as of 2023 is $65/tonne); or (vi) subject to certain restrictions, any permutation of (i) through (v) above.\n\n\nTIER is not only relevant to Regulated Facilities and the persons responsible for them. Project proponents of Emission Offset producing facilities must comply with certain TIER requirements as well. Such facilities, if operated in accordance with TIER prescribed GHG quantification protocols, can generate Emission Offsets which can be sold to a person responsible for a Regulated Facility so that such Emission Offset can be used to achieve the annual compliance obligations in respect of such Regulated Facility.\n\n\nA key feature of TIER is the requirement for persons responsible for Regulated Facilities and Emission Offset project proponents, to have their TIER prescribed filings scrutinized by an entity accredited as a verification body to the ISO Standard 14065:2013 (a **Third Party Assurance Provider**). Accordingly, Third Party Assurance Providers play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of TIER\u2019s industrial carbon pricing and emission trading system.\n\n\n**The Charges**\n\n\nAmberg Corp. (**Amberg**) and Olga Kiiker (**Kiiker**) face the following 25 charges for actions alleged to have occurred between April 1, 2021 and June 29, 2021:\n\n\n* 1 charge under section 44(a) of [the *Emission Management Act*](https://canlii.ca/t/56128) for knowingly providing false or misleading information pursuant to a requirement under *Emission Management Act* or the regulations to provide information;\n* 1 charge under section 44(b) of *Emission Management Act* for providing false or misleading information pursuant to a requirement under *Emission Management Act* or the regulations to provide information;\n* 11 charges under section 33(b) of TIER for failing to comply with the rules and other requirements set out in Part 1 of the Standard for Validation, Verification and Audit, in providing a verification referred to in section 15(4)(e) of TIER contrary to section 15(6); and\n* 12 charges under section 33(f) of TIER for performing the functions of a third party assurance provider and not having the qualifications, or is not eligible to be a third party assurance provider under section 27.\n\n\nEach of the charges carry the potential for penalties, ranging between $50,000 - $100,000 for an individual and $500,000 - $1,000,000 for a corporation. Should Amberg and Kiiker be found guilty in respect of all 25 charges, Amberg could be liable for up to $13,000,000 in penalties and Kiiker, individually, could be liable for up to $1,450,000. Although unlikely, the charges against Kiiker, as an individual, also bring the risk of up to two years in prison.\n\n\n**The Role of Environmental Reporting in the Carbon Credit System**\n\n\nThe legitimacy and validity of TIER required filings and any EPCs, Emission Offsets or Sequestration Credits referenced therein, is critical to Alberta\u2019s carbon market.\n\n\nIn the case where an EPC, Emission Offset or Sequestration Credit referenced in an annual compliance report is subsequently found to be invalid, the person responsible for the Regulated Facility to which such compliance report pertains must, within 60 days of receiving notice of the cancellation or direction from AEPA, do one of the following:\n\n\n* pay into the TIER Fund an amount equal to the amount it would have had to contribute to obtain one fund credit for the year the invalidated Emission Offset, EPC or Sequestration Credit was used; or\n* use another unused Emission Offset, EPC, or Sequestration Credit, in place of the invalidated Emission Offset, EPC or Sequestration Credit.\n\n\nIt is important to note that such curative requirements are operative notwithstanding that such invalidated Emission Offset, EPC or Sequestration Credit may have been verified by a Third Party Assurance Provider, as required under TIER. Such verification, while indicative of the validity of such credits, is not conclusively determinative of their validity.\n\n\nAccordingly, it is critical for those transacting in any Emission Offsets, EPCs or Sequestration Credits to not view successful verification as a substitute for the proper allocation of invalidation risk as between buyer and seller in the operative transaction documents.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Alberta Environment and Protected Areas (AEPA) charged an environmental services company for providing false information and lacking necessary qualifications in connection with compliance and reporting obligations under environmental regulations.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The company charged for providing false information and lacking necessary qualifications reflects negatively on their credibility and integrity."}, {"summary": "The charges carry potential penalties ranging between $50,000 - $100,000 for an individual and $500,000 - $1,000,000 for a corporation.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The potential penalties are significant and indicate the severity of the charges."}, {"summary": "The legitimacy and validity of environmental filings and credits is critical to Alberta's carbon market.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The statement highlights the importance of accurate and valid environmental filings but does not express a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Transacting in emission offsets, emission performance credits, and sequestration credits requires proper consideration of the risk of invalidation, even if verified by a third party assurance provider.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The statement provides information about the need for proper allocation of risk but does not express a positive or negative sentiment."}], "semantic_commentary": "Potential risks for carbon credit trading in Alberta.", "sentiment_score": -0.5, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the legitimacy and validity of environmental filings and credits, which are related to systems and policies for removing carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_o1", "reason": "The article is not primarily focused on carbon.

We are essentially the market operator. In our mission of helping scale [voluntary carbon markets](https://esgclarity.com/uae-presidency-sees-carbon-markets-playing-a-key-role/), we are trying to create efficient platforms for the buyers and suppliers coming to market.\n\n\nWe have essentially set up three distinct platforms to date. We started with our classic marketplace in March 2022. The marketplace would appeal to corporate buyers. These are annual buy-to-retire commitments these companies have made in their net-zero targets.\n\n\nThe second platform we set up was in June 2022, which was our auction capability. What the auction mechanism allows for is price discovery. We will curate a set of buyers to participate in the auction. It\u2019s basically sensing demand, ensuring as they come to market the auction is actually successful.\n\n\nFinally, what we launched on 6 June this year is our exchange. Our exchange caters to physically delivered [carbon credits](https://esgclarity.com/thailand-boosts-carbon-credits-to-meet-new-net-zero-goals/). This is a classic trading environment. Within that exchange, we also built and listed our benchmark. Our benchmark is quite a big value proposition of what we set out as an exchange.\n\n\nWe are also working with SGX on developing a futures product. Core to actually being able to launch a futures contract is to have an accepted benchmark. Timing for the futures product is dependent on market proofing and other things but we will probably come or be able to through SGX bring carbon futures to the market in the early part of next year. We are very well on that path already.\n\n\n**CIX announced last month that it had cleared seven transactions totalling 12,000 tonnes of carbon credits on the first day of trading on its spot market. What is the latest update since then?**\n\n\nWe are incredibly fortunate with how our trading launch has gone. It\u2019s always very hard. We essentially launched a new platform, a new product, a new contract and a benchmark overlay on that all in one day. That\u2019s pretty hard to do just as one big bang.\n\n\nWe did manage to clear 12,000 tonnes on our first trading day. So far we are seeing daily participation, we are seeing good depth in participation on both the bid and the offer side, we\u2019ve seen spreads narrow to within five cents of each other. Obviously that makes transactions a lot easier and quicker to do.\n\n\nWe launched with more than 30 onboarded trading counterparts. We have another 15-20 in our pipeline that we are working on onboarding now. So we continue to grow the depth of our clients within what we can trade so far.\n\n\nSo far we have more than 20 project vintage pairs that have been bid or offered in it including [ARR](https://bezerocarbon.com/insights/afforestation-reforestation-and-restoration-the-root-of-carbon-removals/) and [Blue Carbon](https://www.thebluecarboninitiative.org/) as well. So we\u2019ve expanded out from just pure [REDD+](https://redd.unfccc.int/) projects.\n\n\nIn terms of volumes to date, we actually are ahead of where we thought we\u2019d be. And it\u2019s north of 450,000 tonnes at the moment. We are very positive and very happy with the performance to date.\n\n\n**To what extent do you think Singapore can develop into a regional hub for the trading of carbon credits and how important is the fact [that the government will allow companies to use VCM carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/singapore-hike-carbon-tax-by-five-fold-2024-2022-02-18/)?**\n\n\nI look at Singapore\u2019s capability and what it\u2019s done in the past: successfully building the oil and petrochemicals hub in the early 2000s and from 2010 to 2020, maybe a little bit further, building and creating the iron ore and coke and coal hub. What we\u2019re trying to position for now is a regional carbon trading hub. We\u2019re optimistic about it because of what Singapore has been able to do.\n\n\nObviously, we\u2019re optimistic with what CIX has been able to build so far. Just to give you context on our exchange, over half the customers are non-Singaporeans. So, we already have that outreach of international private companies coming here and looking to participate within the voluntary carbon market in Singapore.\n\n\nWe keep talking to the respective arms of the government. We continue speaking to [MAS](https://esgclarity.com/mas-launches-esg-impact-hub/) on a very regular basis with respect to regulation and how regulation could play a role in this. And the foundations are here for this to start to grow.\n\n\nWhat the government has also allowed now is for companies to buy valid international carbon credits as an offset mechanism instead of paying the carbon tax in dollars. What this means then is through the work the Singaporean government is doing with the bilateral deals they are signing with countries around the world is that they\u2019re curating a supply and identifying which international carbon credits will be applicable to the carbon tax.\n\n\n**How important was the breakthrough at [COP26](https://esgclarity.com/tag/cop26/) on the broad principles governing international carbon markets and what more do you think needs to be done to establish the technical details of implementing a global carbon market?**\n\n\nIt was amazing what COP26 achieved. It set the foundations in article 6. We\u2019ve got to always remember that we\u2019re playing in the voluntary carbon market. What article 6 governs is how these voluntary credits can move across borders.\n\n\nAll that was achieved in COP26, we see as hugely beneficial and amazing in driving the market forward. The challenge now comes in the details. The challenge comes in the bilateral negotiations. I\u2019m sure you can imagine trying to get 197 countries to negotiate and agree is very challenging. Even on a bilateral basis, these take time.\n\n\nWhat we see happening leading into [COP28](https://esgclarity.com/asia/cop27-asia/) and what we hope will happen again is greater partnerships between countries and the private sector. We\u2019ve had governments come and speak to us at COP, which we\u2019ve followed up on with other discussions about how can we help them understand the voluntary market. It\u2019s a great step forward but there\u2019s a long way to go.\n\n\nIn looking at addressing some of these challenges we see, I would probably just point out two recent movements that have happened, which are the [ICVCM](https://www.google.com/search?q=ICVCM&rlz=1C1CHBF_enHK1052HK1052&oq=ICVCM&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIMCAIQABgUGIcCGIAEMgcIAxAAGIAEMgcIBBAAGIAEMgcIBRAAGIAEMgcIBhAAGIAEMgcIBxAAGIAEMgcICBAAGIAEMgcICRAAGIAE0gEHMzAzajBqNKgCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and the [SBTi](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/). So with SBTi and the role ICVCM plays, I\u2019m finally starting to see a convergence in an unregulated voluntary market coming on some core standard baselines.\n\n\n**The VCM still has a reputation to some degree of being the wild west of carbon markets. What steps can market participants take to guard against greenwashing and ensure that the integrity of the VCM is secured?**\n\n\n[Greenwashing](https://esgclarity.com/vanguard-hit-with-greenwashing-lawsuit-in-australia/) is an important risk to consider. It\u2019s always going to be out there. Greenwashing in context of the VCM throws up questions such as when does a company decide or declare what its targets are? And then what does it try to publish it has done to meet those targets?\n\n\nThe ICVCM and these types of bodies issue codes of practice. We\u2019ve issued a responsible use guidance paper on carbon credits. And we hope the more publicity that comes out of these, then they become more accepted in a more broader climate context.\n\n\nSo, we\u2019re trying to work with what we can influence and how we can help in drawing distinctions on what is reportable, what is measurable and what is sustainable until we have greater regulation.\n\n\nA lot of the regulators are working on it. We see it with SGX. We see it with the MAS asking for greater reporting requirements of companies\u2019 commitments and how they\u2019re achieving this. From the regulatory side, we hope with greater guidance coming through, we will be able to avoid some of these problems associated with greenwashing.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Voluntary carbon markets (VCM) have grown in popularity as more companies seek to offset their carbon footprint.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The increasing popularity of voluntary carbon markets is a positive development for companies striving to reach their net-zero goals."}, {"summary": "Singapore launched Carbon Impact X (CIX) to tap into the growing demand for carbon offsets.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The launch of Carbon Impact X signifies Singapore's commitment to becoming a regional carbon trading hub."}, {"summary": "Mark Glossoti, CIX's COO, discusses the progress of the exchange since its launch.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The discussion provides factual information without expressing positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "CIX has set up three distinct platforms, including a marketplace, auction capability, and spot trading exchange.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The summary provides information without expressing positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "CIX cleared 12,000 tonnes of carbon credits on the first day of trading on its spot market.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The successful clearance of carbon credits on the first day of trading indicates a positive start for CIX."}, {"summary": "CIX aims to develop Singapore into a regional hub for trading carbon credits.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The development of Singapore into a regional hub for carbon trading would be a positive outcome for the industry."}, {"summary": "Singapore's government allows companies to use VCM carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The government's support for using VCM carbon credits as an offset mechanism is a positive step towards achieving carbon reduction goals."}, {"summary": "COP26 achieved breakthroughs in governing international carbon markets, but further work is needed to establish technical details.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The summary provides information without expressing positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Partnerships between countries and the private sector are crucial for advancing the voluntary carbon market.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The involvement of countries and the private sector in advancing the voluntary carbon market is seen as a positive step."}, {"summary": "Efforts are being made to address challenges in the voluntary carbon market and guard against greenwashing.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The efforts to address challenges and prevent greenwashing are positive steps towards ensuring the integrity of the voluntary carbon market."}], "semantic_commentary": "Article: \nVoluntary carbon markets (VCM) have grown in popularity as more companies seek to offset their carbon footprint.\n\nComment: \nGrowing demand for carbon offsets drives popularity of VCM.", "sentiment_score": 0.7, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions systems, policies, and companies that remove carbon from the atmosphere, such as voluntary carbon markets and carbon offsets."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions companies committing to reducing their carbon footprint and purchasing carbon credits, such as Singapore launching Carbon Impact X (CIX) to tap into the growing demand for carbon offsets."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, such as CIX clearing 12,000 tonnes of carbon credits on the first day of trading on its spot market."}]}, {"source": "Clayton County Register -", "link": "https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/news2/milking-the-cash-cow-with-carbon-credits/91757/", "title": "India's Efforts Towards Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2070", "content": "India\u2019s Efforts Towards Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2070\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  [August 14, 2023](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/news2/milking-the-cash-cow-with-carbon-credits/91757/)  [Jorge Diaz](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/author/user4/)India is taking significant steps towards achieving its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2070. The country is implementing various initiatives in sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles (EVs), Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE), green hydrogen, waste-to-wealth, organic and natural farming. Additionally, India is also launching a domestic compliance carbon market to facilitate the trading of carbon credits.\n\nWhile India has experience in carbon trading, particularly in wind energy, biogas production, clean cooking stoves, and agricultural land management, carbon projects in agriculture have been relatively less frequent. However, India is making progress in implementing sustainable agricultural practices, including zero tillage, alternative wetting and drying, direct seeding of rice, and integrated nutrient and residue management.\n\nIn terms of addressing climate change, it is crucial to assess whether these efforts are targeting the highest greenhouse gas emitters in the agriculture sector. Animal husbandry, specifically dairy farming, significantly contributes to global warming due to the emission of potent greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. Methane, produced through enteric fermentation and animal waste storage, has a global warming potential 28 times higher than carbon dioxide. Nitrous oxide, released from manure storage and fertilizer use, has a global warming potential 265 times greater than carbon dioxide.\n\nIndia plays a crucial role in global emission reduction, with dairy cattle alone responsible for 16% of the world\u2019s enteric emissions. However, Indian crossbred cattle emit significantly more greenhouse gases per kilogram of milk compared to cows in the United States. Given the expected increase in the bovine population, these emissions are projected to continue rising.\n\nTo effectively curb emissions, India needs to focus on producing more milk per unit of methane emitted. Achieving this goal requires providing animals with high-quality feed and implementing methane emission mitigation strategies. Two potential solutions include leveraging the large cooperative network to implement emission reduction strategies through village-level dairy cooperative societies and utilizing carbon markets to incentivize farmers through carbon credits.\n\nFurthermore, research has identified potential game-changers in combating enteric emissions, such as 3-Nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) and Asparagopsis taxiformis (red seaweed). These solutions have shown promise in reducing enteric methane emissions.\n\nAlthough India currently has registered biogas projects, none of them specifically target reducing enteric methane emissions. One of the challenges in addressing this issue is measuring and monitoring enteric emissions, especially involving smallholder farmers. To overcome this challenge, a simple digital measurement, reporting, and verification system should be developed.\n\nBy focusing on enteric methane reduction in the livestock sector and implementing effective solutions, India can make a substantial positive impact on the environment and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.\n\n\n [AI](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/ai/), [Markets](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/markets/), [News](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/news2/), [World](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/world/)", "summaries": [{"summary": "India is working towards achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2070 through various initiatives in sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles, and agriculture.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The efforts towards achieving net zero carbon emissions are seen as positive because they contribute to environmental sustainability."}, {"summary": "India needs to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from dairy farming, which contributes significantly to global warming.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The high greenhouse gas emissions from dairy farming are seen as negative because they contribute to global warming."}, {"summary": "India can curb emissions by increasing milk production per unit of methane emitted and implementing methane emission mitigation strategies.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The focus on increasing milk production per unit of methane emitted and implementing mitigation strategies is seen as positive because it can reduce overall emissions."}, {"summary": "Potential solutions for reducing enteric methane emissions in the livestock sector include leveraging cooperative networks and utilizing carbon markets.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The potential solutions for reducing emissions are seen as positive because they can incentivize farmers and contribute to emission reduction."}, {"summary": "Challenges in addressing enteric methane emissions include measuring and monitoring emissions, especially involving smallholder farmers.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The challenges in addressing emissions are seen as neutral because they are obstacles that need to be overcome for effective emission reduction."}], "semantic_commentary": "Article: India should utilize carbon markets to reduce enteric methane emissions.", "sentiment_score": 0.4, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions that India is working towards achieving net zero carbon emissions and implementing methane emission mitigation strategies."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon emissions and greenhouse gas emissions."}]}, {"source": "Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide", "link": "https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/the-eu-emission-trading-system-are-you-ready/", "title": "The EU Emission Trading System \u2013 are you ready? | Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide", "content": "\n![](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ship_pollution_emissions_CO2-290x242-150x150.jpg)\nThere has been increasing interest in expanding existing domestic emission trading schemes to also cover international shipping. There is now agreement in the EU on how the EU\u2019s emission trading system will be applied to shipping from 2024. Owners and charterers should start to think about how they are going to deal with its requirements.\nOn a nation state level, governments can impose taxes on the sources of pollution at the point of production or sale. An example is petrol, with the aim that the taxes generated will cover the cost of dealing with the resulting pollution and incentivise reduced consumption. The difficulty in international shipping is that if just a few governments took this approach for bunker fuel, the buyers would likely adjust their arrangements so that they avoided bunkering at the taxed ports. Therefore, for a sales tax on bunker fuel to be effective, governments of all the major bunkering ports around the world would need to coordinate and agree to tax bunker fuel in the same way. With such cooperation looking very unlikely in the near term, and IMO discussion of a carbon tax still in its early stages, governments are now looking at imposing costs on emissions, rather than on fuel at the point of sale.\n\n\nAn emission trading scheme (ETS) is a tool that governments and regulators are expected to use increasingly often in the fight to reduce the pollution created by international shipping. The central idea behind an ETS is to have a market mechanism to ensure that \u201cthe polluter pays\u201d \u2013 the payment being for the environmental and social cost of pollution, its clean-up cost and potentially also research into technology that will reduce or remove it. Of course, increasing the cost of pollution also creates an incentive to generate less of it.\n\n\nFor this reason, there has been growing interest in expanding existing emission trading schemes to include international shipping, including in the EU, China and Japan. The basic idea of an ETS is that a capped number of emission permits are bought and sold on the market, with emitters having to purchase and surrender enough allowances to cover their emissions. The price of the allowances will change over time to reflect the balance of supply and demand, and emitters then are incentivised to find the cheapest (ie. most efficient) ways to reduce emissions.\n\n\n**The EU Emission Trading Scheme**\n\n\nLaunched in 2005, the EU\u2019s Emission Trading System works as a \u201ccap and trade\u201d scheme where emitters of CO2 in certain sectors have to purchase allowances to cover their carbon emissions during the relevant trading period. The number of allowances at any one time are fixed, but they generally reduce each year, so that emissions within the EU also fall.\n\n\nHow the scheme will be applied to shipping has beenunder discussion for some time, but there now seems to be agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission thatthe key features will be:  \n\n\u2022 Application to all vessels over 5,000 GT trading within EU waters, irrespective of flag  \n\n\u2022 Start date of 1 January 2024 (pushed back from 1 January 2023)  \n\n\u2022 A phased-in implementation, with 40% of emissions covered by the system during 2024, 70% for 2025 and 100% for 2026.  \n\n\u2022 All intra-EU voyage emissions to be covered by the scheme  \n\n\u2022 50% of EU in-bound/out-bound voyage emissions will be covered  \n\n\u2022 The \u2018shipping company\u2019 (defined as owner, manager or bareboat charterer) will be responsible for surrendering the allowances  \n\n\u2022 The system will cover carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide  \n\n\u2022 30 April deadline for surrender of allowances for the previous calendar year -for example, 30 April 2025 deadline for 2024 emissions  \n\n\u2022 Non-compliance can lead to penalties and expulsion orders  \n\nSeveral parts of the scheme are still unclear, and questions have been raised about two particular areas relating to shipping. First, in the Special Rapporteur\u2019s report of 24 January 2022, it says that where a ship is on charter and the owner is not responsible for purchasing fuel or making decisions about the vessel\u2019s speed, cargo or route, then:\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 a binding clause should be included in such arrangements for the purpose of passing on the costs so that the entity that is ultimately responsible for the decisions affecting the CO2 emissions of the ship is held accountable for covering the compliance costs paid by the shipping company under this Directive.\u201d\n\n\nWhilst many vessel owners would support the motivation behind this provision, it is far from clear how EU law would impose such a clause in private contractual arrangements between parties that may not be based in EU states. What happens if the charterparty contains no such clause? Could the owners rely on EU law to seek recovery from the charterers in the EU even if there was no such clause in the charterparty? Might it result in some voyage-charterers being forced to pay for EU ETS allowances even though they did not supply the fuel?\n\n\nA second area of discussion is how emissions on voyages into or out of the EU are to be determined, and if operators may seek to evade the full application of the EU ETS. For example, if a vessel calls at an intermediate port just outside of the EU shortly after leaving EU waters, that may result in the out-bound voyage being assessed as much shorter than one from/to the actual next load port. The change of routing may cause the operator extra costs, but the benefit of the avoided allowances could be greater, depending on the assumptions made. We would expect this issue to be covered by the scheme once implemented, but at the moment it is an area that needs more thought.\n\n\n**Emission trading schemes and time charterparties**\n\n\nOperating vessels under an ETS is a completely new situation for vessel owners and time charterers, so the learning curve will be steep. The issues under each scheme may be different, but the following points are likely to be of general relevance, not just to the EU system.\n\n\nIn the first instance, the practical steps needed to comply with ETS requirements are likely to fall on vessel owners. This will include (i) registration with the scheme, (ii) recording, documenting and submitting the vessel\u2019s emissions data needed for compliance, and (iii) opening an account to receive, hold and surrender the necessary allowances. It may be that some of these tasks can be handled by a third party, such as a vessel manager or broker.\n\n\nHow a vessel owner and charterer share the costs of complying with an ETS is more open to negotiation. The general view seems to be that as ETS costs will be directly linked to the fuel used by the vessel, as between an owner and a charterer, whoever is responsible for the cost of the fuel should also cover the cost of ETS compliance by buying allowances. This seems logical as the cost of ETS allowances could be seen as just part of the fuel cost and may in fact be included in bunker prices if bunker sellers decide to sell fuel and allowances together.\n\n\n**New BIMCO clause**\n\n\nBIMCO has an ETS\u2013 Emission Trading Scheme Allowances Clause for TimeCharter Parties 2022. Under the clause, the charterer is responsible for purchasing and transferring to the ownersallowances to cover the vessel\u2019s actual emissions used in ETS areas while on hire. The clause also covers other issues, such as sharing data to enable compliance with an ETS, reconciliation between the allowances and actual consumption at the end of a charter, and giving the owners a right to suspend\n\n\nThe BIMCO clause has been draftedto apply to any scheme around the world, and to cover any greenhouse gas that may be subject to a scheme, not just carbon.\n\n\nUnder most time charterparties, the vessel owner does what they can to reduce their credit risk to the charterer \u2013 for example by requiring hire to paid in advance, and bunkers arranged and paid for by the charterer. One issue that some vessel owners may also wish to consider is if they want similar principles to apply for ETS allowances. To avoid allowances being transferred in arrears, owners could require the charterer to transfer enough allowances up front to cover the bunker fuel to be used under the ETS, to be topped up as/when the vessel receives new fuel. If so, the BIMCO clause would need to be amended. From a time charterer\u2019s point of view, it may also be necessary to consider how the reconciliation and accounting will be carried out for emissions, which are arguably for owners\u2019 account, such as during off-hire or deviation for owners\u2019 purposes.\n\n\nThese issues are unlikely to be relevant in the context of voyage charters, where the owner will generally be responsible for supplying the fuel, and hence the cost of any allowances that arise from using it. Owners who voyage charter will therefore need to build something into their freight/demurrage rates for ETS costs. The costs of ETS allowances may be relevant under some consecutive voyage charterers if they have clauses to adjust freight rates depending on bunker prices \u2013 for example, if bunkers are sold inclusive of allowance costs, or as ETS allowance prices change.\n\n\n**What to do now?**\n\n\nNow that the EU\u2019s emission trading system has been agreed, vessel owners and charterers that may trade within the EU should ensure they are prepared for comply with its requirements in 2024. Preparation includes setting up contractual arrangements to suit their needs, for which the BIMCO ETS clause is a good starting point.

The scheme will cover costs incurred between 2021 and 2030. The support measure is aimed at reducing the risk of \u2018carbon leakage\u2019, where companies relocate their production to countries with less stringent emission rules, resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions globally.\n\n The measure will benefit companies active in sectors and sub-sectors listed the [EU ETS Carbon Leakage List](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019D0708). Those sectors face significant emission costs and are particularly exposed to international competition.\n\n The compensation will be granted to eligible companies through a partial refund of the additional costs incurred in the previous year, with the final payment to be made in 2031. The level of compensation is between 65% and 95% of the costs, depending on the emission intensity of the beneficiaries.\n\n In order to maintain incentives for beneficiaries to switch to less polluting fuels, the aid amount is calculated based on fuel and heat benchmarks. The beneficiaries bear a certain share of the additional costs resulting from the German fuel ETS, corresponding to 150 tCO2 per year, for which no aid will be granted.\n\n In order to qualify for compensation, beneficiaries will have to invest at least 50% (as of 2025 at least 80%) of the aid amount in (i) measures identified in their \u2018energy management system\u2019, setting out energy efficiency objectives and a strategy to achieve them; or (ii) the decarbonisation of their production processes.\n\n **The Commission\u2019s assessment**\n\n The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, in particular [Article 107(3)(c)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A12008E107) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\u2018TFEU\u2019) which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions.\n\n The Commission found that the scheme is necessary and appropriate to support energy-intensive companies to cope with higher fuel costs resulting from the German fuel ETS in order to reduce the risk of carbon leakage.\n\n Moreover, the Commission considers that by making the aid conditional upon energy efficiency and decarbonisation efforts, the measure contributes to the objective of maximising the incentives for a cost-effective decarbonisation of the economy. It therefore supports the EU\u2019s climate and environmental objectives and the goals set in the [European Green Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/communication-european-green-deal_en). Furthermore, the Commission concluded that the aid granted is limited to the minimum necessary and will not have undue negative effects on competition and trade in the EU.\n\n On this basis, the Commission approved the German scheme under EU State aid rules.\n\n **Background**\n\n The [European Green Deal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2019%3A640%3AFIN), presented by the Commission on 11 December 2019, sets the goal of making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU\u2019s policy to combat climate change and a key tool for curbing greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. On 30 June 2021, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the [European Climate Law](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-green-deal/european-climate-law_en) endorsing the binding target to cut emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.\n\n On 10 May 2023, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the [revised EU ETS Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2023.130.01.0134.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2023%3A130%3ATOC) which introduced an emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and additional sectors not covered by the [current ETS](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02003L0087-20200101&qid=1612859075941). The ETS2 will be a separate, but complementary, trading system and the auctioning of allowances under it will start in 2027.\n\n Germany introduced the \u201cGerman fuel ETS\u201d to cover emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels that are not covered by the EU ETS. It applies since 1 January 2021 and targets emissions from the transport and building sectors, as well as energy and industrial installations falling outside the scope of the EU ETS, helping Germany reach its climate goals.\n\n Each year, reporting fuel suppliers must purchase German fuel emission allowances based on the quantity of fuels they placed on the German market and surrender the corresponding amount of German fuel emission allowances. Fuel suppliers then pass on the additional cost of the German fuel ETS to consumers.\n\n Germany committed to adapting its national fuel ETS and the notified measure (i) following the revision of the EU ETS Directive and the adoption of the related implementing acts or (ii) if the Commission issues new or amended State aid guidelines applicable to the measure, in order to bring them in line with the provisions and timelines of the applicable EU ETS rules.\n\n The non-confidential version of today\u2019s decision will be made available under the case number SA.63191 in the [State Aid Register](https://competition-cases.ec.europa.eu/search?caseInstrument=SA) on the Commission\u2019s competition\u00a0[website](https://ec.europa.eu/competition-policy/index_en)\u00a0once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are \n\nlisted in the [Competition Weekly e-News](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/comp/newsletter-archives/view/service/2012).\n### Share this Sting:\n\n* \n* \n* Share\n* [Save](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?guid=RusNVZik3dho-2&url=https%3A%2F%2Feuropeansting.com%2F2023%2F08%2F14%2Fstate-aid-commission-approves-e6-5-billion-german-scheme-to-address-carbon-leakage-risk-for-energy-intensive-companies-resulting-from-national-fuel-emission-trading-system%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Feuropeansting.files.wordpress.com%2F2023%2F05%2Femissions.jpg%3Fw%3D823&description=State%20aid%3A%20Commission%20approves%20%E2%82%AC6.5%20billion%20German%20scheme%20to%20address%20carbon%20leakage%20risk%20for%20energy-intensive%20companies%20resulting%20from%20national%20fuel%20emission%20trading%20system)\n* \n* [Email](mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20State%20aid%3A%20Commission%20approves%20%E2%82%AC6.5%20billion%20German%20scheme%20to%20address%20carbon%20leakage%20risk%20for%20energy-intensive%20companies%20resulting%20from%20national%20fuel%20emission%20trading%20system&body=https%3A%2F%2Feuropeansting.com%2F2023%2F08%2F14%2Fstate-aid-commission-approves-e6-5-billion-german-scheme-to-address-carbon-leakage-risk-for-energy-intensive-companies-resulting-from-national-fuel-emission-trading-system%2F&share=email&nb=1 \"Click to email a link to a friend\")\n* [Print & PDF](https://europeansting.com/2023/08/14/state-aid-commission-approves-e6-5-billion-german-scheme-to-address-carbon-leakage-risk-for-energy-intensive-companies-resulting-from-national-fuel-emission-trading-system/?share=custom-1433708571&nb=1 \"Click to share on Print & PDF\")\n* [Reddit](https://europeansting.com/2023/08/14/state-aid-commission-approves-e6-5-billion-german-scheme-to-address-carbon-leakage-risk-for-energy-intensive-companies-resulting-from-national-fuel-emission-trading-system/?share=reddit&nb=1 \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n* \n* [Telegram](https://europeansting.com/2023/08/14/state-aid-commission-approves-e6-5-billion-german-scheme-to-address-carbon-leakage-risk-for-energy-intensive-companies-resulting-from-national-fuel-emission-trading-system/?share=telegram&nb=1 \"Click to share on Telegram\")\n* [WhatsApp](https://europeansting.com/2023/08/14/state-aid-commission-approves-e6-5-billion-german-scheme-to-address-carbon-leakage-risk-for-energy-intensive-companies-resulting-from-national-fuel-emission-trading-system/?share=jetpack-whatsapp&nb=1 \"Click to share on WhatsApp\")\n* \n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n\n[![](https://europeansting.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/emissionss.jpg?w=350&h=200&crop=1)](https://europeansting.com/2022/08/22/state-aid-commission-approves-e27-5-billion-german-scheme-to-compensate-energy-intensive-companies-for-indirect-emission-costs/ \"State aid: Commission approves \u20ac27.5 billion German scheme to compensate energy-intensive companies for indirect emission&nbsp;costs\")#### [State aid: Commission approves \u20ac27.5 billion German scheme to compensate energy-intensive companies for indirect emission\u00a0costs](https://europeansting.com/2022/08/22/state-aid-commission-approves-e27-5-billion-german-scheme-to-compensate-energy-intensive-companies-for-indirect-emission-costs/ \"State aid: Commission approves \u20ac27.5 billion German scheme to compensate energy-intensive companies for indirect emission&nbsp;costs\")\n\n(Credit: Unsplash) This article is brought to you in association with the\u00a0European Commission.

Jacky-Long Mouthuy is a law student at Maastricht University. He files this dispatch from Maastricht, Netherlands.*\n\nAs wildfires plague Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Spain and many other countries across the globe witness the effects of climate change, it\u2019s apparent that the\u00a0 EU\u2019s environmental policy is in trouble. Last Wednesday Poland challenged the legality of two major EU legal acts that are part of the \u201cFit for 55\u201d package currently before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Fit for 55, the flagship of the EU environmental policy, is a bundle of legal acts aiming at reducing the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by 2030. The target represents a milestone towards the objective of creating a carbon-neutral EU by 2050.\n\nThe two challenged acts are the revised EU Emission Trading System Directive (EU ETS) and the Carbon Adjusting Border Mechanism Regulation (CBAM). The former empowers Member States to give allowances to industrial sectors to emit a certain amount of GHG, thus imposing an emission cap on installations. If an industrial installation fails to emit less than the imposed cap, it can purchase allowances to another installations. The increase of environmental obligations upon companies prompted several of them to relocate their installations outside of the EU. CBAM aims at remedying this effect. Importers have to purchase CBAM certificates, which mirror ETS prices, corresponding to the GHG emissions to produce the imported good.\n\nConcerning the EU ETS Directive, Poland claims that the wrong procedure as well as the wrong legal basis have been used to adopt it. As for the CBAM, Poland claims that the Regulation infringes several fundamental principles of EU law. These actions for annulment pile up on the CJEU\u2019s desk, which is already dealing with four Polish complaints against other environmental laws. Those submissions relate to the EU ban on registration of combustion vehicles as of 2035, the reduction of the maximum amount of GHG emission, the reduction in the number of free allowances available under the ETS and the recent CJEU ruling declaring Poland\u2019s forest management incompatible with EU rules. The repeated challenges of EU regulations tackling climate change by Poland is explained by the fact that its industry and energy security heavily rely on fossil fuels. \n\nIn 2019, when the EU adopted the 2050 target to become carbon neutral, Poland was the only Member State opposed to the plan. This might have predicted the future challenges that Poland would present to EU environmental efforts. But beside the Polish government, EU environmental policy is facing another challenge: time.\n\nIt is less than a year before the next EU elections in June 2024 and it is yet uncertain who will preside over the Commission and the Council, the co-legislators with the EU Parliament, which will also be renewed itself. This race against time both regarding climate urgency and the upcoming elections was felt in the last weeks before the August break. Just before that break, the Council approved the adoption of several environmental legal acts, namely the regulations on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (ReFuelEU aviation) and on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport (FuelEU maritime), the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. Many other files remain to be discussed, such as the Energy Taxation Directive whose revision is still pending since 2021. That will most likely be a matter for the next legislature which will prove to be crucial in the pursuit of the 2030 and 2050 targets. \n\nOpinions expressed in JURIST Dispatches are solely those of our correspondents in the field and do not necessarily reflect the views of JURIST's editors, staff, donors or the University of Pittsburgh.", "summaries": [{"summary": "Poland has challenged the legality of two major EU legal acts that are part of the \"Fit for 55\" package, aimed at reducing the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Neutral because it is a legal challenge to EU environmental policy."}, {"summary": "The two challenged acts are the revised EU Emission Trading System Directive (EU ETS) and the Carbon Adjusting Border Mechanism Regulation (CBAM).", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Neutral because it is about the details of the legal acts being challenged."}, {"summary": "Poland claims that the wrong procedure and legal basis were used to adopt the EU ETS Directive, and that the CBAM Regulation infringes several fundamental principles of EU law.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Negative because Poland is challenging the legality of the acts."}, {"summary": "Poland's challenges to EU regulations on climate change are in line with its reliance on fossil fuels for industry and energy security.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Negative because Poland's challenges go against EU environmental efforts."}, {"summary": "There is a race against time for the EU to address climate urgency before the next EU elections in June 2024.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Neutral because it is a statement of urgency without positive or negative connotations."}, {"summary": "The Council approved the adoption of several environmental legal acts, but many other files remain to be discussed, including the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Neutral because it is about the adoption and pending discussion of environmental legal acts."}, {"summary": "The next legislature will be crucial in pursuing the 2030 and 2050 environmental targets.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Neutral because it states the importance of the next legislature without positive or negative connotations."}], "semantic_commentary": "Poland challenges EU emissions regulations, impacting carbon credit trading.", "sentiment_score": -0.2857142857142857, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions the EU's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and the adoption of environmental legal acts, indicating a commitment to reducing carbon footprint."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, specifically the challenges faced by Poland regarding EU regulations on climate change."}]}, {"source": "Engineering News-Record", "link": "https://www.enr.com/articles/56946-stakeholders-cite-technology-risks-of-cutting-power-plant-emissions", "title": "Stakeholders Cite Technology Risks In Cutting Power Plant Emissions | Engineering News-Record", "content": "\n\n[News](/topics/652-news)[Projects](/topics/113-projects)[Business](/topics/119-business)[Environment](/topics/127-environment)[Power & Industrial](/topics/129-power-industrial)[Government](/topics/134-government)[Project delivery](/topics/123-project-delivery)[Risk](/topics/135-risk)[Construction technology](/topics/587-construction-technology)\n### Climate Change Mitigation\n\n\nStakeholders Cite Technology Risks In Cutting Power Plant Emissions\n===================================================================\n\n\nBy [Mary B. Powers](/authors/151-mary-b-powers), [Debra K. Rubin](/authors/96-debra-rubin)\n\n![OUTSIDLongridge_ENRready.jpg](//www.enr.com/ext/resources/2023/08/15/OUTSIDLongridge_ENRready.jpg?1692133002)\nThe 485-MW Long Ridge combined cycle \nnatural gas power plant in Hannibal, Ohio, which started operating in 2021, is set to burn up to 50% hydrogen fuel and will \neventually transition to 100%. It is the first such U.S. facility to \nhave the hydrogen blend.\n\n\n*Photo:**Kiewit Corp.*\n\n\n\n\nAugust 15, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed rule to cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants is too ambitious considering the state of emerging technologies it relies on, said utilities, grid operators, unions and state regulators as well as some environmental advocates and others, in hundreds of comments filed as the agency moves to finalize its sweeping plan to replace a Trump administration regulation.\u00a0\n\nBut in review of responses delivered to EPA by deadline on Aug. 9, commenters also said proposed agency solutions are starting to be implemented.\n\nThe agency proposal, [announced in May,](https://www.enr.com/articles/56451-epa-power-plant-rule-pushes-carbon-capture-low-carbon-hydrogen) would mandate under the U.S. Clean Air Act new carbon dioxide emission cuts from those plants based on what it says are cost-effective and available control technologies\u2014specifically carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and natural gas co-firing.\u00a0\n\nNew and existing gas-powered plants operating full-time must capture 90% of emissions by 2035. Existing coal-fired power plants must do the same by 2030 to stay online in 2040\n\nEPA has said it aims to finalize the rule next year, but that could be a challenge.\n\nThe proposal would tighten emissions reduction requirements closer to those in the Obama Administration Clean Power Plan, which was only briefly enacted in 2015 because of lawsuits that challenged EPA regulatory authority. The issues were addressed last year in the U.S. Supreme Court's *West Virginia v. EPA* [ruling](https://www.enr.com/articles/54443-implications-for-industry-as-supreme-court-curbs-epas-authority).\u00a0\n\nIn a joint comment August 9, [a coalition](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-supports-epas-proposed-rule-regarding-fossil-fuel-fired)of 20 largely Democratic-led states and six cities said the proposed emissions-reduction rule is \u201cwithin the four corners of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year ... and consistent with Congress's ambitious actions to curb power plant GHG emissions.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut a group of 21 Republican-led states strongly contrasted that view[in comments](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/eenews/f/eenews/?id=00000189-d6c8-dc67-a1bf-f7fd92880002)they submitted on Aug. 8, with a legal showdown ahead likely. \u00a0\"If finalized, EPA\u2019s impossible proposal will leave coal- and natural-gas plants with no other option but to close. Yet EPA has no more authority to mandate this result indirectly than it did when it tried to do so directly.\" said the states. \"The proposed rule exceeds EPA\u2019s authority by forcing the kinds of major shifts that *West Virginia* already said can\u2019t be imposed.\"\n\nEPA estimates that between 2028 and 2042, the rule would cut 617 million metric tons of CO2 from the air in the U.S.  \n  \n\n\n### **Techs Could Limit Power Delivery**\n\nBut trade groups such as the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities and even the nonprofit, independent Electric Power Research Institute, note current shortfalls in the technologies to enable sufficient reliable power delivery. In its comments, the institute said the technologies \u00a0\u201chave seen little to no deployment at scale so far and depend on new infrastructure\u201d that affect their feasibility and costs beyond the scope of the agency analysis.\n\nThe new supporting infrastructure required\u2014including production space, pipelines and storage for hydrogen, and pipelines and storage for carbon capture\u2014\u201cshould be considered in their entirety to fully understand the potential benefits, costs and deployment challenges and opportunities,\u201d said the institute.\n\nIt said provisions in the EPA rule use optimistic assumptions about cost, schedule and operating flexibility for carbon capture and storage, adding that while hydrogen power could play an important role in a net-zero economy, it has not been demonstrated at the scale \u201cenvisioned.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it will hold a technical conference in November on the proposed rule.\n\nFour large regional power transmission operators\u2014the 13-state PJM Interconnection, 15-state Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Southwest Power Pool serving 14 states abd Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2014said the proposed rule has the potential to \u201cmaterially and adversely\u201d affect grid reliability.\u00a0\n\nSouthwest Power Pool noted its progress in being an early renewable energy integrator and large user of onshore wind to supplement fossil-fuel power when feasible, but it said proposed technologies will not be available to replace reductions in that generation.\n\nThey said that when combined with other EPA rules and policies, the CO2 emission-cut proposal \u201ccould well exacerbate\u201d the growing risk of generation retirements. New clean energy resources seeking connection \u201cdo not, at present, provide the same level of essential reliability services as their thermal counterparts,\u201d the grid operators said.\n\nWhile they support new technologies, the grid systems said EPA\u2019s proposed \u201cbest system\u201d of emissions reduction \u201coverstates\u201d current co-firing viability for carbon-capture and hydrogen \u201cand ignores the cost and practicalities of developing new supporting infrastructure\u201d within the agency's planned timeline.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHope is not an acceptable strategy,\u201d they said.\u00a0\n\nUtility members of the American Public Power Association said they have reduced GHG emissions 31% from 2005 to 2022 but noted the proposed rule's expected impact on providing affordable power reliably.\u00a0\n\nThe Iowa Utilities Board slammed EPA as \u201centirely unconcerned with the negative impacts of a lack of electricity in the bulk power system\u201d under the rule, with its hard focus on air quality impacts from coal and natural gas power plants. The agency is \u201cmeddling in reliability determinations that are outside its expertise,\" the state board said, stressing that it needs to listen to concerns by key stakeholders\n \u201cto avoid introducing further instability\u201d into the U.S. power system.\n\nA group of unions, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, ironworkers' union, Transportation Communications union, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and United Mine Workers, said the proposed rule could eliminate nearly 274,000 direct jobs in the industry and 1.1 million indirect jobs. The group supports its mandate for routine maintenance and a unit-specific emissions rate for facilities set to retire before 2032, but the unions suggested adding flexibility for states to develop in-state emission trading programs.  \n  \n\n\n### **Stakeholders Look at Solutions**\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council said the rule will reduce atmospheric CO2 and sulfur dioxide but could increase nitrogen oxide and fine particle emissions through more CCS and hydrogen. \u201cWhile the fundamental structure of the proposal is strong, key improvements can and should be made,\u201d said David Doniger, its senior strategic director.\n\nOther Edison Electric Institute members said they are installing the technologies, including Entergy in Texas, with a $1.5-billion new power plant under construction set to use a fuel blend of at least 30% hydrogen. NextEra Energy said it plans to convert over the decade most gas-powered plants of its subsidiary Florida Power & Light to run on hydrogen, while California-based Pacific Gas & Electric said it will have hydrogen fuel-blending operational by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cFar from being too restrictive, the guidelines offer flexibility and build on technology and processes that the industry is already putting in use to great effect today,\u201d said [comments](https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2023/constellation-to-file-comments-offering-support-for-new-epa-guidelines-to-reduce-carbon-emissions-from-power-plant.html) by Joe Dominguez, CEO of energy firm Constellation Energy Corp., which has been developing nuclear power. He said he was \"disappointed\" by responses \"from many of my peers represented by the Edison Electric Institute and others working to block these very practical measures.\"\n\nXcel Energy said the proposed rule is largely workable but it [recommended](file:///C%3A/Users/clarkk/Downloads/EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0072-0532_attachment_1%20(1).pdf) more compliance flexibility\u00a0\n\n\u201cCarbon capture and storage and co-firing with clean hydrogen are \napproaches individual plants can use to meet the required emission \nlimits,\u201d said Michael Myers, New York assistant attorney general, in the state comment submission, adding that states can use emissions averaging and trading to comply.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is the way cooperative federalism is supposed to work,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\nKEYWORDS: [carbon capture and storage](/keywords/2294-carbon-capture-and-storage) [Carbon reduction](/keywords/16516-carbon-reduction) [Clean energy construction](/keywords/18635-clean-energy-construction) [EPA](/keywords/193-epa) [federal regulation](/keywords/6086-federal-regulation) [Hydrogen Power](/keywords/17033-hydrogen-power) [power plant](/keywords/118-power-plant) [Proposal](/keywords/91-proposal) [US Environmental Protection Agency](/keywords/6540-us-environmental-protection-agency)\n\n\n### Share This Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n[![ENR Subscribe](/ext/resources/custom-content/Registration/ENR-subscribe.png)](/unlimited)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Mbpowersheadshot](https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/images/2018/MBPowersheadshot.jpeg?height=96&t=1546273310&width=96)](https://www.enr.com/authors/151-mary-b-powers)**Mary B.

"The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is upon us, and blockchain technology is swiftly becoming a game-changing ingredient in its passing, not only for the financial sector but also for several other industries.  \n\n\n\nHowever, before delving into the specifics of how this innovative technology is revolutionizing today's industries, it is essential to understand what [blockchain technology](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/blockchain?ref=hackernoon.com) is and why it has gained popularity over the past decade.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of Blockchain Technology\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA blockchain is essentially a distributed ledger that consists of a series of records called blocks, securely interconnected through cryptographic hashes. These blocks are linked together in a sequential manner, forming a chain-like structure. Each block contains vital data, including a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction information, usually represented as a Merkle tree, with data nodes as leaves.\n\n\n   \n \n\nWhat makes blockchain a unique technology is its core set of features, which includes immutability (preventing alteration of already recorded transactions), decentralization (lacking a central governing authority), and transparency (allowing anyone to view or track transactions). All these features combined introduce a novel technology that fundamentally eliminates the need for central intermediaries and enables distributed verifiability by multiple actors (validators).\n\n   \n \n\nAs for its origin, the first blockchain-like protocol was suggested by David Chaum in his 1982 dissertation paper dubbed \"Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.\" However, it was not until many years later, when Satoshi Nakamoto developed and released Bitcoin, that the idea behind the blockchain came into practical existence.\n\n   \n \n\nToday, blockchain is one of the 4IR technologies that is significantly revolutionizing industries, alongside [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-ai?ref=hackernoon.com), Virtual Reality (VR), and The Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nBlockchain\u2019s Impact on Today\u2019s Industries\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nAccording to the latest [report](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/blockchain-market-100072?ref=hackernoon.com) by Fortune Business Insights, the total blockchain technology market size reached $11.14 billion in 2022, with projections showing it could exceed $469.49 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 59.9%. North America accounts for almost 50% of this capital, with a market size of $5.25 billion in 2022.\n\n\n   \n \n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27623%27%20height=%27310%27/%3e)![image](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nImage Source: [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/?ref=hackernoon.com)\n\n\n   \n \n\nOf course, several industries are benefiting from this capital injection, but in this article, we will highlight five main sectors that are looking particularly promising or have made notable advancements in blockchain adoption: financial services, supply chain, healthcare, energy, and real estate.\n\n### Financial Services\n\n\nBitcoin was launched at a time when the global financial system was on the brink of collapse as a result of the US housing bubble. While most traditional banks are still opposed to the idea of decentralized crypto assets, a good number of the leading banks, including Standard Chartered, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, have [invested](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/5-leading-banks-that-invested-in-crypto-and-blockchain/?ref=hackernoon.com) in research or the development of the underlying tech - blockchain.\n\n\n   \n \n\n**How is blockchain transforming financial services?**\n\nLet's start with the most basic function of the financial ecosystem: payments. Unlike the traditional payments system, where it can take up to a week for settlements to clear, digital assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins such as USDT and USDC only take a few minutes or hours. Additionally, these transactions are much cheaper as there are no central intermediaries involved to charge exorbitant fees.\n\n\n   \n \n\nEven more intriguing is the emergence of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a nascent crypto niche whose architecture resembles traditional finance. DeFi offers all the financial services you can get from a bank, investment manager, or brokerage, with the only difference being that there are no 3rd parties involved. Instead, settlements are automated through pre-coded smart contracts when the settlement conditions are met.\n\n   \n \n\nAnd although DeFi is yet to go mainstream, there are currently over [$43 billion](https://defillama.com/?ref=hackernoon.com) locked in various DeFi protocols that offer services ranging from exchanges, lending, derivatives, and staking. It is also interesting to note that traditional banks are gradually joining the DeFi bandwagon, with JP Morgan having [executed](https://cointelegraph.com/news/jp-morgan-executes-first-defi-trade-on-public-blockchain?ref=hackernoon.com) its first DeFi trade last year.\n\n   \n \n\nMeanwhile, on blockchain infrastructure adoption, Ripple's enterprise blockchain solution has been gaining traction and is currently being used by Standard Chartered and Axis Bank to enhance the efficiency of on-demand corporate payments between the two banks.\n\n### Supply Chain Management\n\n\nThe global supply chain management market was valued at $27.2 billion in 2022. Estimates by [Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/supply-chain-management-software-market?ref=hackernoon.com) show it is poised to hit $75.6 billion within the next decade, growing at a CAGR of 10.9%. Behind this growth are technological advancements, most notably AI, IoT, and blockchain technology, which are playing an integral role in streamlining supply chain systems.\n\n\n   \n \n\nAt its core, blockchain technology reinforces the key features of supply chain management, which include tracking, visibility, inventory management, and ethical practices. By tracking raw materials and final products using an immutable ledger, blockchain has made it possible for all participants in a specific supply chain to verify the origin of raw materials, ensure their originality throughout the chain, and seamlessly facilitate transaction finality.\n\n   \n \n\nGiven this value proposition, it comes as no surprise that the supply chain is one of the areas where we are seeing notable advancements in blockchain integration. A good example is De Beers' proprietary blockchain-powered platform, Tracr, which was [launched](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-technology-to-power-de-beers-diamond-production?ref=hackernoon.com) in 2022 to enhance the company's diamond production and distribution supply chain. Worth noting is that De Beers is one of the largest diamond producers in the world.\n\n   \n \n\nUAE's state-owned oil company, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), is another entity that has integrated blockchain into its supply chain through a partnership with [tech behemoth IBM](https://hackernoon.com/what-will-ibms-acquisition-of-randori-mean-for-cybersecurity?ref=hackernoon.com). The initiative allows stakeholders to effectively track oil, starting from the wells all the way to the consumption stage, while logging on-chain and verifiable transactions at each stage of the process.\n\n### Healthcare\n\n\nHealthcare has also benefited from the advent of blockchain technology, particularly in the securing of patient data. According to a recent healthcare data breach [report](https://www.hipaajournal.com/june-2022-healthcare-data-breach-report/?ref=hackernoon.com#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%2012%20months,of%2057.67%20breaches%20a%20month.) by the HIPAA Journal, 692 data breaches were reported between July 2021 and June 2022, compromising the personal information of over 42 million individuals. This is a worrying trend, given the sensitivity of medical data.\n\n\n   \n \n\nBut with blockchain in the picture, it is now possible for the healthcare industry to reduce the cases of data corruption through decentralized and tamper-proof data logs. Already, several startups have sprung up to offer blockchain-as-a-service to the medical industry, including the likes of Akiri, Medicalchain, Guardtime, and Patientory. All these firms offer [data security solutions](https://hackernoon.com/startups-of-the-year-2023-meet-inigo-a-graphql-api-management-and-security-solution?ref=hackernoon.com) powered by blockchain technology.\n\n   \n \n\n*\u201cAn interoperable blockchain can strengthen data integrity while better-protecting patients\u2019 digital identities. The blockchain\u2019s inherent properties of cryptographic public/private key access, proof of work, and distributed data create a new level of integrity for health care information.\u201d reads a [report](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/public-sector/us-blockchain-opportunities-for-health-care.pdf?ref=hackernoon.com) by Deloitte.*\n\n### Energy and Sustainability\n\n\nThe issue of climate change is a hot and controversial topic that cannot be ignored, regardless of which side of the fence you sit on. For context, climate change activists envision a net-zero carbon world, which means that every CO2 emission must be offset by an equivalent amount of carbon credits. As it stands, one carbon credit is equivalent to one metric ton of carbon.\n\n\n   \n \n\nSo, how do companies access the extra carbon credits? The most straightforward way is through an emission trading system (ETS). However, with the carbon credit demand projected to reach 1.5 to 2.0 gigatons by 2030, this market needs to be made more accessible. This is where blockchain technology comes into play, enabling the conversion of carbon credits into tokenized digital assets that can be sold in decentralized markets.\n\n   \n \n\nWhile still a nascent area of innovation, several carbon credit initiatives tied to blockchain and crypto have [emerged](https://bluenotes.anz.com/posts/2022/07/anz-carbon-credits-tokenisation-blockchain-zerocap?ref=hackernoon.com) in the recent past. One example is Universal Carbon, which claims to be the premier project introducing a tradeable carbon token that resides on a public blockchain. Ideally, users can purchase this token and choose to hold it as an investment or burn it to offset one-year tonne of carbon emissions.\n\n   \n \n\nOverall, blockchain technology through [tokenization](https://bitcoinglobalmacro.com/blog/real-world-assets-rwa-decentralized-finance/?ref=hackernoon.com) is opening up an opportunity for a larger population to participate in carbon credit markets, ultimately boosting liquidity and advancing the path toward achieving carbon neutrality.\n\n### Real Estate\n\n\nLast but not least is the real estate market. Here, blockchain proposes several use cases, ranging from recording titles in distributed ledgers to property management automation and tokenization. The use of smart contract technology for property transactions and verifying the legitimacy of the seller not only reduces transaction costs and time but also enhances the due diligence process.\n\n\n   \n \n\nHowever, what I find more intriguing is the aspect of [tokenization](https://hackernoon.com/shared-ownership-through-tokenization?ref=hackernoon.com), which essentially bridges the gap between the traditional real estate market and on-chain economies. Imagine being able to buy a portion of a house or a piece of land without necessarily having to own the whole unit; that's what tokenized real estate introduces - fractionalized investing. This makes the real estate market more liquid and globally accessible.\n\n   \n \n\nFor instance, suppose you wanted to sell a 200,000-square-foot property via blockchain. In that case, one can simply leverage a platform like [Tokeny](https://tokeny.com/tokenized-real-estate/?ref=hackernoon.com) to list the property by first securitizing it (selecting the jurisdiction of issuance and distribution). Once done, you can proceed to tokenize it and divide the property into smaller shares represented by digital tokens, enabling prospective investors to purchase the shares and own a portion of the property.\n\n   \n \n\nObviously, real estate tokenization is still a grey area both in terms of development and regulatory framework. However, given the underlying potential, we are likely to see more stakeholders in this market tapping into blockchain technology.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Also published [here](https://bitcoinglobalmacro.com/blog/revolutionizing-industries-with-blockchain-technology/?ref=hackernoon.com).*  \n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Blockchain technology is revolutionizing industries by providing features like immutability, decentralization, and transparency.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Blockchain technology is introducing novel features that eliminate the need for central intermediaries and enable distributed verifiability."}, {"summary": "The total blockchain technology market size reached $11.14 billion in 2022 and is projected to exceed $469.49 billion by 2030.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The market size of blockchain technology is growing at a CAGR of 59.9%, indicating significant growth and potential."}, {"summary": "The financial services industry is transforming with blockchain technology, enabling faster and cheaper payments and the emergence of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Blockchain technology is revolutionizing payments by making settlements faster and cheaper, and DeFi offers financial services without involving third parties."}, {"summary": "The supply chain management industry is benefiting from blockchain integration by enhancing tracking, visibility, inventory management, and ethical practices.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Blockchain technology enables participants in the supply chain to verify the origin and originality of raw materials, facilitating transaction finality and improving supply chain systems."}, {"summary": "Blockchain technology is securing patient data in the healthcare industry through decentralized and tamper-proof data logs.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Blockchain technology offers data security solutions that strengthen data integrity and protect patients' digital identities."}, {"summary": "Blockchain technology is enabling the conversion of carbon credits into digital assets, advancing the path toward achieving carbon neutrality.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Blockchain technology is making carbon credit markets more accessible and boosting liquidity, contributing to the goal of achieving carbon neutrality."}, {"summary": "Blockchain technology is proposing use cases in the real estate market, including recording titles, property management automation, and tokenization.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Blockchain technology reduces transaction costs, enhances due diligence, and introduces fractionalized investing, making the real estate market more liquid and globally accessible."}], "semantic_commentary": "Relates to Intent: \"Blockchain can secure carbon credit transactions.\"", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions blockchain technology enabling the conversion of carbon credits into digital assets, which is related to systems and products that remove carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_o1", "reason": "The article does not mention companies committing to reducing their carbon footprint, news about carbon, or anything unrelated to carbon."}]}, {"source": "SuperyachtNews.com", "link": "https://www.superyachtnews.com/operations/dont-be-left-high-and-dry", "title": "SuperyachtNews.com - Operations - Don\u2019t be left high and dry", "content": "\n\n\n\n\nBy SuperyachtNews in collaboration with Nigel Marrison, founder, Blue ESG  \n15 Aug 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDon\u2019t be left high and dry\n==========================\n\n\nNigel Marrison, founder\u00a0of Blue ESG, says how we tackle global-emissions goals will determine the very future of superyachts\u2026\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://media.superyachtnews.com/uploads/2023-226/b694bf8923f1db6b80379132ee52c029.jpg)\n\n\nSuperyacht owners rely on a network of trusted advisors to ensure their assets are being properly managed, maintained and operated in the most productive and efficient manner. Add to this a growing pressure to decarbonise and this remit is now more challenging than ever before.\n\n\nThe climate emergency is shifting the commercial landscape in all directions and the consequences of inaction will only increase, even to the point where a vessel can no longer legally operate. As captains and advisors, it\u2019s our responsibility to act in the best interests of the owner and to provide the best possible advice on every aspect of superyacht ownership, and this includes risk management across the board. The very real prospect of stranded assets cannot be overstated; it poses an existential threat to the entire industry and our survival will be determined by what we do, or fail to do, today.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**What is a stranded asset?**  \nA stranded asset is defined as \u201can asset which loses economic value well ahead of its anticipated useful life\u201d (Daniela Saltzman, *Stranded Carbon Assets*). This unanticipated devaluation can be caused by a range of risk factors, including changes in legislation, market forces, environmental challenges, social norms and consumer behaviour.\n\n\n**Decarbonisation**  \nThe IPCC 6th assessment 2023 report on climate change summarises the current trajectory as follows: \u201c*Limiting human-caused global warming requires net zero CO2 emissions. Cumulative carbon emissions until the time of reaching net-zero CO2 emissions and the level of greenhouse gas emission reductions this decade largely determine whether warming can be limited to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C (high confidence). Projected CO2\u00a0 emissions from existing fossil-fuel infrastructure without additional abatement would exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5\u00b0C (50 per cent).*\u201d\n\n\nThese facts are well known, yet the superyacht industry continues to fly in the face of growing scrutiny from regulators, legislators, the marketplace and society at large.\n\n\n**Social uprising**  \nWe are seeing an increase in laws, public protests and negative stories in the media against the level of emissions, as well as criticism of the overall footprint of the UHNWI lifestyle.\n\n\nAvoiding scrutiny is not a matter of privilege. Whichever way you look at it, whether moral, financial or existential, the time to implement a credible and practical strategy towards decarbonisation is now. Whether or not an individual owner is motivated by environmental concerns, owners\u2019 reps and their inner circle have an urgent obligation to impress upon their clients the very real threat of reputational damage and financial losses.\n\n\n![](https://media.superyachtnews.com/uploads/2023-226/a498727341b6369436cf89e056da0614.jpg)**Nigel Marrison, founder, [Blue ESG](https://www.superyachtnews.com/directory/profile/906249/blue-esg)**\n\n\n**Regulatory pressures**  \nFrom a regulatory perspective, it\u2019s only a matter of time before MARPOL Annex VI CII and SEEMP Part III regulations from the merchant fleet filter down to include luxury yachts.\n\n\nThe EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by setting limits. EU ETS is currently applicable for ships above 5,000gt on EU-related voyages, although in future may include other ship types and sizes with the potential to impact the operation of superyachts.\n\n\n**Legislative changes**  \nThe United Nations Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) is an industry-led, UN-convened group that aims to accelerate the implementation of decarbonisation strategies. It brings together 125 banks in 41 countries, representing more than 40 per cent of global banking assets, committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\nThe insurance industry is implementing similar measures as defined in the Poseidon Principles which requires alignment with Net Zero 2050 targets across their portfolios.\n\n\nFrom a financial perspective alone, superyacht owners will be forced to accept that they are not immune. A refusal to align with global-emissions goals will increasingly pose a challenge to the operation of their yacht.\n\n\nClimate change, regulation and societal acceptance are deeply interconnected, and how we tackle these issues today will determine the very future of luxury yachting. Compared to every other sector, the superyacht industry is lagging conspicuously behind.\n\n\n**Project \u2018Yacht Zero\u2019**  \nIn collaboration with the decarbonisation team at [Lloyd\u2019s Register](https://www.superyachtnews.com/directory/profile/798811/lloyds-register-emea), Blue ESG has designed and developed a superyacht-specific Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) analogous to IMO MARPOL Annex VI CII and SEEMP Part III for the merchant fleet.\n\n\nProject \u2018Yacht Zero\u2019 is a data-collection, analytic tool allowing individual vessels to establish baseline data and facilitate tracking and reporting for operational emissions.\n\n**Profile links**\n\n[Lloyd's Register EMEA](/syindex/profile/798811/lloyds-register-emea)\n\n[Blue ESG](/syindex/profile/906249/blue-esg)\n\n \n\n\nJoin the discussion\n===================\n\nDon\u2019t be left high and dry\n--------------------------\n\n \n\n35018\n\n\n\n\nTo post comments please Sign in or Register\n\n\n\nWhen commenting please [follow our house rules](/discussions-house-rules)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n*[Click here](/shop) to become part of The Superyacht Group community, and join us in our mission to make this industry accessible to all, and prosperous for the long-term.

BelfastTelegraph.co.uk", "content": "Northern Ireland\u2019s leading waste and resource management company, RiverRidge, is spearheading the action as it continuously strives to improve how it uses resources, having set its own environmental goals and ambitions. The company is committed to finding solutions to help decarbonise its own operational waste processes, as well as its vehicle fleet.\n\nRiverRidge is currently focusing on the use of biomethane, a renewable gas, that it believes can be used as a fundamental part of decarbonising Northern Ireland\u2019s energy networks, as well as utilising it as an alternative fuel for vehicles.\n\nBrett Ross, chief executive of RiverRidge, says: \u201cNorthern Ireland has certainly faced its challenges over the past few years and apart from the obvious political issues that have plagued us, our primary issue has been that the UK has been slow to adopt decarbonisation of its energy infrastructure.\n\n\u201cA key area for concern is the UK\u2019s reluctance to embrace renewable heat infrastructure which has meant we are lagging Europe. Energy accounts for two thirds of emissions and 50% of energy consumption is used for heating.\n\n\u201cThe UK, and in fact Ireland, have done very little to develop a renewable heating infrastructure. There are some valid reasons for this but by and large, a cohesive policy to ensure we use our resources to generate renewable heat has been very slow in coming.\n\n\u201cA prime example is the fact that Europe has already recognised the importance of renewable gases such as biomethane and has invested in developing and supporting this sector. Gas is the most suitable form of fuel for heating and Europe recognised this some years ago. It has embraced anaerobic digestion and the generation of biomethane \u2013 between 2018 and 2020 an additional 483 biomethane plants were constructed.\n\n\u201cEurope\u2019s target for biomethane production by 2030 has recently doubled to 342Twh. Here in Northern Ireland, there are a number of established facilities that are harnessing biomethane through the anaerobic digestion process, but the availability of food waste is limited. However, Northern Ireland produces household waste and around 40% of this is suitable for the production of biomethane.\n\n\u201cBiomethane is produced from decomposition or combustion of organic materials and is very similar to natural gas. Organic waste is used instead of simply being disposed of. Crucially, biomethane is capable of injection to NI\u2019s existing gas network and usable in most gas appliances.\n\n\u201cAt RiverRidge, we are aiming to bring a world-class anaerobic digestion facility to market by 2025, which once operational, will generate 145,000MWth of biogas each year for injection into the grid. This \u00a350m construction project will provide a viable alternative to the combustion of waste which is critical to net-zero aspirations and also to the financial viability of Northern Ireland\u2019s local authorities.\n\n\u201cThe next few years will see the introduction of the Emission Trading System, and energy from waste facilities are likely to have carbon capture installed. This means additional gate fees, taxation and rising costs in the waste sector if an alternative is not found.\n\n\u201cBiomethane is that alternative. It is recognised in Northern Ireland\u2019s own energy strategy, The Pathway to Net Zero, but there is much work to do, not least a gas injection point.\n\n\u201cNorthern Ireland needs to embrace solutions to decarbonise our future and it is very clear there is not only an environmental imperative but a financial one.\u201d\n\nRiverRidge continues its commitment to taking action to help decarbonise the region and a recent joint acquisition by Cube Infrastructure Managers and Equitix Investment Management for a majority stake in the company will accelerate its plans. \n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "RiverRidge, Northern Ireland's leading waste and resource management company, is focused on using biomethane to decarbonise Northern Ireland's energy networks and as an alternative fuel for vehicles.
