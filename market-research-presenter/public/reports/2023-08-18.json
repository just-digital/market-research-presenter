The investment marks the first major governmental backing in the world for the emerging carbon-capture technology. The program aims to create four DAC hubs over the next 10 years, each capable of removing and storing at least 1 million tons of CO2 annually. Today, 18 DAC plants worldwide collectively remove only about 11,000 tons of CO2 a year. Critics have slammed DAC as a boondoggle because it requires substantial inputs of energy to capture CO2 and pump it underground. Currently, DAC typically costs more than $1000 to sequester each ton of CO2, far more expensive than planting trees or other carbon-removal strategies. But DAC proponents counter that its costs may fall. They add that the limitations of other methods may require countries seeking to limit climate warming to no more than a 1.5\u00b0C rise by midcentury to use DAC.\n\n\n\nLEGAL AFFAIRS\nYouths win Montana climate case\n-------------------------------\n\n\nA Montana state judge ruled this week in favor of young people who argued that the state\u2019s policies supporting fossil fuels violate their right under its constitution to a \u201cclean and healthful environment.\u201d [The ruling invalidates a provision of a Montana law](https://westernlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023.08.14-Held-v.-Montana-victory-order.pdf) that prevented state officials from considering the climate impacts of energy projects. In June, the case, *Held* v. *Montana*, went to trial, the first of its kind in the United States. Plaintiffs ranging in age from 5 to 22 asserted that Montana\u2019s policies created environmental damage that harmed them directly, such as wildfire smoke that worsened asthma. Climate scientists called as expert witnesses testified about Montana\u2019s worsening natural disasters and high rate of atmospheric warming. The state is expected to appeal. The case was spearheaded by the nonprofit Our Children\u2019s Trust, which has related lawsuits pending in four other states. Similar victories have been won in European courts.\n\n\n\n#### SIGN UP FOR THE *SCIENCE*ADVISER NEWSLETTER\n\n\nThe latest news, commentary, and research, free to your inbox daily\n[Sign up](/action/clickThrough?id=501060&url=%2Fcontent%2Fpage%2Fscienceadviser%3Fintcmp%3Dnewsint-adviser%26utm_id%3DrecyGhsQrqyNFKTmt&loc=%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2Fnews-glance-win-young-climate-activists-research-suspension-and-china-s-mpox-surge&pubId=42003569&placeholderId=501022&productId=501030)\n\n\n\nRESEARCH OVERSIGHT\nStudies halted at N.Y. institute\n--------------------------------\n\n\nA U.S. watchdog office in June suspended 124 clinical trials underway at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, a facility affiliated with Columbia University. The unusual move by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), first reported last week by The New York Times, came 2 weeks after the institute itself paused all 417 human-subject studies underway there. The actions followed the suicide more than a year ago of a participant in the placebo arm of a study testing a Parkinson\u2019s disease drug, levodopa, to treat depression and reduced mobility; that study was suspended in January 2022. Its lead investigator, psychiatrist Bret Rutherford, resigned from the institute on 1 June and is no longer on the Columbia faculty. Two journals have retracted papers related to Rutherford\u2019s levodopa research, citing methodological problems. The institute said in a statement it is \u201cworking with its federal partners to create a research safety review plan\u201d and is awaiting OHRP\u2019s approval to resume the federally funded studies.\n\n\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\nChina faces mpox surge\n----------------------\n\n\nChina last week [confirmed 491 cases of mpox in July](https://www.chinacdc.cn/jkzt/crb/qt/szkb_13037/gwjszl_13092/202308/t20230809_268502.html), a monthly high and nearly five times June\u2019s total. Cases of the infectious disease, formerly known as monkeypox, have also increased in other Asian countries after plummeting in the Americas and Europe. The disease is spread through intimate personal contact and has particularly affected men who have sex with men; more than 96% of the infections in China were among this group, according to a 9 August announcement by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency reported no severe cases or deaths. Officials believe China\u2019s strict COVID-19 restrictions on international travel, in place until this spring, kept the disease at bay during the 10 months starting in July 2022 when the World Health Organization designated mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. With no vaccine yet available domestically, China is relying on raising public awareness and changes in behavior to limit the outbreak.\n\n\n\n\n### 76%\n\n\nShare of U.S. survey respondents who support requiring all advanced artificial intelligence models to have their safety evaluated by independent experts.

The unusually high rate raises questions about whether intentional efforts to boost the reputation of Chinese institutions is contributing to China\u2019s large share of the most cited papers. The comparable figure for the United States was 29% and for other countries less than 20%, according to the analysis, which averaged data from 2019 to 2021. [China produced the biggest share (nearly 30%) of papers](https://www.nistep.go.jp/archives/55391) among the top 1% most highly cited, the report says, as well as the most scientific publications indexed in Clarivate\u2019s Web of Science Core Collection. The United States was second in those categories. The analysis did not explain whether the citations by authors in China are relevant to the studies in which they appear or indicate padding.\n\n\n\nPARTICLE PHYSICS\nMuon magnetism mulled\n---------------------\n\n\nPhysicists at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory last week [released a new measurement of the magnetism of a particle called the muon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMB1znns4lQ), a heavier, unstable cousin of the electron. With an uncertainty of 0.2 parts per billion, the new result confirms with twice the precision the one released 2 years ago. However, it has not elicited as much excitement as the 2021 result, which appeared to [slightly exceed the prediction of physicists\u2019 prevailing standard model](/content/article/particle-mystery-deepens-physicists-confirm-muon-more-magnetic-predicted), possibly signaling undiscovered particles lurking in the vacuum around the muon. Theorists now realize the standard model\u2019s prediction was less certain than thought, obscuring whether the muon is really extra-magnetic. They hope to make a more reliable prediction before experimenters release their final result in 2025.\n\n\n\nWILDLIFE\nDeal aids red wolf conservation\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\n![A red wolf and her pup](/do/10.1126/science.adk3470/files/_20230818_nib_redwolves.jpg)\nA red wolf and her pup are part of a captive population in North Carolina used to help increase the only wild one.GERRY BROOME/AP IMAGES\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has agreed to continue to release captive-bred red wolves (*Canis rufus*) to boost the only wild population of this endangered species, reversing an earlier decision to stop the releases. The new policy resulted from a court settlement, announced last week, with conservation groups that had sued the agency. Although red wolves once lived in most of the southeastern United States, hunting and habitat loss caused a massive fall off that by 1972 drove the species nearly to extinction\u2014unusual among recent declines of large North American mammals. Decades of captive breeding and releases lifted the wild population to only about 120 animals. Car accidents and poaching have taken a toll, and local landowners have objected to the releases. After FWS stopped them in 2015, the wild population fell to about 15 individuals. Now, the agency has made an 8-year pledge to release wolves under a restoration plan more thoroughly informed by research. Some supporters say the population\u2019s recovery will require an additional measure\u2014policing poachers.\n\n\n\nLABOR RELATIONS\nNIH reverses course on union\n----------------------------\n\n\nAfter questioning the legal standing of a unionization effort by early-career researchers, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) now says it won\u2019t oppose a vote by potential union members. In a filing with the Federal Labor Relations Authority, NIH officials had contended that many potential members, including postdocs and graduate students, weren\u2019t \u201cemployees\u201d with a right to unionize. But they reversed that position last week.\n\n\n\nSCIENCE POLICY\nIndia creates research funder\n-----------------------------\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Parliament last week approved a new research funding agency aimed at boosting the nation\u2019s scientific standing.

(Anusandhan is Hindi for \u201cinnovation.\u201d) [The foundation](/content/article/india-aims-invigorate-science-hefty-new-funding-agency) is rooted in a 2019 proposal to create an agency, modeled after the U.S. National Science Foundation, that would be funded by the government while having an arm\u2019s-length relationship with elected officials. But the structure approved by lawmakers gives India\u2019s prime minister broad powers to appoint the agency\u2019s leaders. Critics say that opens the door to political interference. And some wonder whether the agency can realize its funding plan, which calls for industry to contribute about 70% of an envisioned $6 billion outlay over 5 years.\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The U.S. Department of Energy will invest $1.2 billion in two carbon-removal facilities in Texas and Louisiana, marking the first major governmental backing for this emerging technology.

To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday,* [*sign up here*](https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/climate-energy-the-spark/)*.*\n\n **I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a single conversation I\u2019ve had about climate technology over the past year that didn\u2019t reference the Inflation Reduction Act at least once.**\n\n  I\u2019m probably an exception to the rule, though. As a climate reporter, I\u2019m firmly in the camp of people who think about climate change all the time\u2014but not everyone does. And if you haven\u2019t heard of this law, you\u2019re not alone. According to a new poll, [71% of people in the US have heard little or nothing about the Inflation Reduction Act.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/07/biden-white-house-climate-policy/) In case you fall into this group, let me hit the high points for you:\n\n * It\u2019s often referred to as the IRA for short\n* Signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022 (a year ago today!)\n* Included an estimated $369 billion in funding for climate change\n* Made up of grants, loans, and a whole lot of tax credits\n\n That\u2019s a metric boatload of money, and people in climate have been speculating about what it will all mean ever since we got the first version of the bill more than 365 days ago.\u00a0\n\n \nI just [published a story](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/16/1078014/ira-funding-one-year-climate-technology/) about where things stand with US climate tech policy after one year of the IRA. [Check it out](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/16/1078014/ira-funding-one-year-climate-technology/), and for the newsletter this week **let\u2019s consider what\u2019s changed and what\u2019s next for the breakthrough climate law.**\n\n ### **Manufacturing**\n\n **Then:** My colleague James Temple and I [wrote about the Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/28/1056531/technology-wins-breakthrough-climate-bill/), which was then still a bill, as soon as the draft text was released in late July 2022. It was clear at the time that this would be a very big deal for US climate action:\u00a0\n\n \n*Ryan Fitzpatrick, director of the climate and energy program at Third Way, said it\u2019s an ambitious and politically pragmatic bill designed to boost US manufacturing, provide support where job sectors are shifting, and build out the infrastructure needed to shift to cleaner, modern energy systems.*\n\n *\u201cThis would be the largest investment of its kind in American history,\u201d he said.*\n\n Related Story\n-------------\n\n[How a half-trillion dollars is transforming climate technology](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/16/1078014/ira-funding-one-year-climate-technology/)Checking in with the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, one year later.\n\n\n **Now:** While a lot of the funding still hasn\u2019t made it out the door yet, there are early signs that this boost in US manufacturing is well underway. There\u2019s a constant flurry of companies citing the IRA while announcing massive investments in new manufacturing facilities in the US for clean technologies.\u00a0\n\n Take First Solar, the largest US solar panel manufacturer. Just two weeks after the IRA became law last year, the company [pledged to expand its factory operations in the US](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/first-solar-pledges-big-us-factory-expansion-thanks-climate-law-2022-08-30/) and build a $1.2 billion factory in the Southeast, directly citing the climate law in its announcement. A few weeks ago, the company made [another announcement about plans to scale even further](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/first-solar-plans-11-bln-investment-fifth-us-panel-factory-2023-07-27/) and build yet another billion-dollar factory.\u00a0\n\n  In total, companies have announced over [$76 billion in private investments](https://www.jackconness.com/ira-chips-investments) in climate technology manufacturing since the IRA was signed into law.\u00a0\n\n ### **Electric vehicles**\n\n **Then**: There were early concerns that [restrictions in the EV tax credits](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/02/1056606/ev-tax-credits-battery-supply/) could limit how many vehicles would wind up qualifying for them, limiting their effectiveness.\u00a0\n\n The rules lay out that consumers would only get the full $7,500 credit for a new EV if the vehicle is made from materials and batteries from the US (or free trade agreement partners). The rules attached to the credits were aimed at boosting US production of battery minerals, components, and cells. At the time, it wasn\u2019t totally clear exactly how everything would get interpreted, and just how restrictive these would wind up being.\u00a0\n\n **Now:** We\u2019ve gotten some clarity on most of the EV tax credits, and it seems like the agency has largely erred on the side of allowing more vehicles to qualify. But even today, there are looming questions on this major program.\u00a0\n\n \n\nNamely, there\u2019s a bit that excludes EVs that have a \u201cforeign entity of concern\u201d involved in their supply chain starting in 2024. That term hasn\u2019t really been defined yet\u2014though there\u2019s a chance that China, which dominates several parts of the EV supply chain, will fall into that category. \n\n Check out [my story on the EV credits from last year](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/02/1056606/ev-tax-credits-battery-supply/) for more on what that could mean for battery prices and EV ownership. I\u2019d also recommend looking back at a newsletter from my colleague Zeyi Yang about how [EV batteries could be the next point of tension between the US and China.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/22/1069032/ev-batteries-politicization-china-us/)\n\n ### **Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\n **Then: The number I heard over and over last year was 40%\u2014experts said that the IRA would cut US emissions by 40% from 2005 levels by 2030.** It was more than what the country was on track for (around a 30% to 35% cut) but less than what the country needs to do to meet international targets (a 50% reduction).\u00a0\n\n Thinking about how modeling experts go from hundreds of billions of dollars to an expected emissions cut broke my brain a little, so I dove into the weeds and spoke with several of them for a story last August about how [predicting the results of economic policies like the IRA is tricky](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/12/1057675/predicting-climate-bill-effects/).\u00a0\n\n Related Story\n-------------\n\n[Predicting the climate bill\u2019s effects is harder than you might think](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/12/1057675/predicting-climate-bill-effects/)Tax credits will drive emissions cuts, but how much and how fast isn\u2019t as clear as models might suggest.\n\n\n At the time they said that we can assume that lower prices means more uptake of products like EVs and solar panels, and we know how much those products cut emissions. But they also pointed out that there are still a lot of complicating factors. People don\u2019t always behave rationally, for example. It can also be hard to tease out how much policies push people to adopt new products that are already getting pretty cheap on their own. That all means we should probably take these predictions with a bit of caution.\u00a0\n\n **Now:** The emissions effects from the IRA\u2019s policies are still mostly projections. We won\u2019t know for a while exactly how well all this money translates into climate action. But early signs in manufacturing and EV uptake are very positive.\u00a0\n\n For even more on how well the IRA might work, and what\u2019s coming next for the breakthrough legislation, [check out my story from earlier today on the legislation\u2019s first anniversary.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/16/1078014/ira-funding-one-year-climate-technology/)\n\n ### **Related reading**\n\n For more on what\u2019s in the IRA and what experts thought at the time, check out our [initial coverage from last summer](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/28/1056531/technology-wins-breakthrough-climate-bill/), as well as my follow-up stories on the [EV tax credits](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/02/1056606/ev-tax-credits-battery-supply/) and how emissions modelers worked to figure out [what the money would mean for climate progress.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/12/1057675/predicting-climate-bill-effects/)\u00a0\n\n \n[This opinion piece from Jonas Nahm](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/21/1063525/the-us-climate-bill-emission-dependent-economic-success/) (now a senior economist for the Biden administration\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers), published last November, lays out how the IRA ties climate action with economic success.\u00a0\n\n My colleague James Temple [took on the topic of carbon capture subsidies in the IRA.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/25/1058591/why-the-carbon-capture-subsidies-in-the-climate-bill-are-good-news-for-emissions/) There was ([and is](https://twitter.com/jtemple/status/1691572872328941851?s=20)) concern that investing in carbon capture could extend the life of fossil fuel plants. But James points out that the subsidies could be crucial in hard-to-decarbonize sectors like steel and cement.\u00a0\n\n \n### **Another thing**\n\n **The US just invested over $1 billion in carbon removal**. The funding is mostly going to two direct air capture hubs\u2014one in Texas and the other in Louisiana.\u00a0\n\n By some estimates, we may need to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year to stay below 2 \u00b0C of global warming. That\u2019s a daunting figure, one that could require trillions of dollars to pull off.

Last week, it announced two major \u201ccarbon removal\u201d programs meant to capture carbon and bury it safely underground.\n\n\nThe first program, approved by congressional [appropriations last year](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2022-12-20/html/CREC-2022-12-20-pt1-PgS7819-2.htm), deploys $35 million to \u201cestablish a competitive purchasing pilot program for the purchase of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere or upper hydrosphere.\u201d The second, part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, is a larger $3.5 billion program to develop \u201cdirect air capture\u201d (DAC) facilities across the country. Of that total, the recipients of $1.2 billion were announced, with roughly half going to the oil and gas company Occidental Petroleum and most of the rest going to a partnership of companies including Battelle, Climeworks, and Heirloom.\n\n\nAs the *Financial Times* [explained](https://www.ft.com/content/9aa4a126-707a-41c9-841e-467d969ca766), the aim of this latter program is to kick-start the direct air capture industry: \u201cThe White House hopes the grants will help commercialise the air capture process, driving down costs and spurring a buildout across the country.\u201d\n\n\nWhile [scientists are clear](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SPM.pdf) that we need some level of carbon capture and storage to avoid the worst effects of climate change, it is less clear why the government should pay capitalists \u2014 let alone oil companies \u2014 to do it. Of course, some carbon dioxide can be captured and sold as inputs for a variety of uses (soda production, refrigeration, welding, and so on), but most of it has no market whatsoever. Like much \u201cwaste management,\u201d the disposing of carbon should be a *public service* not a for-profit business.\n\n\nWhile \u201cBidenomics\u201d has so far mostly involved using the fiscal power of the state to shower money on the private sector (and \u201c[de-risk](https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-wall-street-consensus-at-cop27/)\u201d investments), the challenge of carbon removal could be an opportunity to rebuild state capacity and reinstantiate the role of the public sector in making visible investments in socially useful work and environmental restoration.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo We Even Need Carbon Capture?\n===============================\n\n\nThere are few topics more controversial on the climate left than carbon capture and storage (CCS), a [variety of technologies](https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/catalyst-with-shayle-kann/taking-a-closer-look-at-carbon-capture) aimed at capturing carbon dioxide and storing it (usually in geological depositories). Most climate justice organizations fiercely [oppose](https://climatejusticealliance.org/cj-leaders-denounce-ccs-at-whejac/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) the technology as, at best, an unproven \u201cfalse solution\u201d or, at worst, a cynical ploy by the fossil fuel industry to justify continued operations for decades to come.\n\n\nThe problem with environmentalist opposition to carbon capture is that climate scientists agree we probably [need a lot of it](https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-dioxide-removal-industry-biden) to avoid a catastrophic level of warming above 2 degrees Celsius. That is because of two material realities. First, we\u2019ve emitted so much carbon already that even if we stopped emissions tomorrow, we would still need to deal with the already massive amount of carbon in the atmosphere.\n\n\nSecond, there are some forms of emissions \u2014 scientists call them \u201c[residual emissions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01592-2)\u201d \u2014 for which there are no clear technological pathways to mitigation. For example, making cement creates a byproduct of carbon dioxide (the industry itself is estimated to be responsible for around [7-8 percent](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/greening-cement-production-has-big-role-play-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions) of global emissions), and applying nitrogen fertilizer to soil creates greenhouse gas emissions. Assuming we want to live in a society with cement and fertilizer, we need either to find a way to capture the emissions at the source or to compensate for them with direct air capture.\n\n\nIn fact, you could say the Biden administration\u2019s plans for carbon removal are woefully insufficient compared to what is required. James Temple [points out](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/11/1077756/the-us-just-invested-more-than-1-billion-into-carbon-removal/):\n\n\n\n> By some estimates, nations may have to collectively pull down some 10 billion tons a year by midcentury to have a good shot at keeping the planet from warming beyond 2\u00b0C. . . . It would take 10,000 DAC hubs with the capacity of the ones funded on Friday to reach it.\n> \n> \n\n\nA political bonus of accepting the scientific necessity of carbon capture is that labor unions [strongly support](https://www.axios.com/2021/08/03/climate-unions-congress-carbon-capture-funding) scaling up the technology as a means to maintain and expand industrial jobs with historically high levels of unionization (e.g., pipeline construction for CO2 and power plants with CCS).\n\n\nThe Left is [currently split](https://catalyst-journal.com/2023/03/socialist-politics-and-the-electricity-grid) between environmental organizations who typically advocate a narrow technical vision of decarbonization (solar, wind, and batteries) and unions who see their interests in a much broader suite of technologies (including [carbon capture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040619021000920) but also [nuclear power](http://www.ibew.org/media-center/Articles/21Daily/2109/210901_ANS_IBEW_OpEd)). You would think it would be obvious for socialists to [align with labor](https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/no-15-winter-2022/unions-labor-green-new-deal), but the ideological pull of a [small-scale, decentralized](https://jacobin.com/2022/04/new-deal-tennessee-valley-authority-electricity-public-utilities-renewables-green-power) energy system looms large on the climate left today.\n\n\nToo much of the climate debate is wrapped up in a moralistic classification scheme wherein some technologies (solar panels and wind farms) are regarded as unequivocally good and others, like carbon capture, are considered totally bad. As Holly Jean Buck [recently argued](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-carbon-capture-distraction/), the climate left is wasting too much energy opposing something that capitalist industry has been reluctant to invest in in the first place; it turns out it\u2019s not particularly profitable to spend money capturing something that has no mass market. Moving forward, Buck says, \u201cthe climate left needs to move beyond the question of which technologies are good or bad and focus instead on how we implement them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, by giving over half a billion dollars to Occidental Petroleum, the Biden administration will only intensify environmentalist opposition to the broad idea of CCS. This is a company whose CEO Vicki Hollub [explained](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/08/oil-industry-shift-climate-tech-00085853) in March that carbon capture \u201cgives our industry a license to continue to operate for the 60, 70, 80 years that I think it\u2019s going to be very much needed.\u201d In fact, Occidental has been most known for using carbon dioxide in \u201cenhanced oil recovery\u201d \u2014 that is, injecting captured carbon underground to help push up still more oil to be burned. This is hardly a climate strategy.\n\n\nThat both newly announced DAC hubs will be located in oil and gas country \u2014 Texas and Louisiana \u2014 will only bolster environmentalists\u2019 cynical view that carbon capture is simply a fossil capitalist con.\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Removal Is a Public Good\n===============================\n\n\nThe administration could have approached this very differently. You could say the climate crisis is at its core a *public crisis*: it is a crisis of the shared atmospheric commons. As ecological Marxist James O\u2019Connor [argued](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10455758809358356) over thirty years ago, capitalists have a structural tendency to undermine the ecological conditions of production.\n\n\nRather than trusting these same capitalists to clean up after themselves, Christian Parenti [rightly argues](https://www.academia.edu/50049776/A_left_defense_of_carbon_dioxide_removal) we should empower the state to build infrastructures of carbon removal as a public utility. While late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century cities confronted the public crisis of water contamination with what some called \u201c[sewer socialism](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS428),\u201d we need to approach the climate crisis in a similar fashion.\n\n\nThe decidedly nonsocialist climate-modeling researchers at the Rhodium Group [recently proposed](https://rhg.com/research/capturing-leadership-policies-for-the-us-to-advance-direct-air-capture-technology/) the US federal government set up something called the Carbon Removal Administration (CRA). The CRA could be modeled on its New Deal forebears \u2014 the Civil Works Administration, the Public Works Administration, the Works Progress Administration, and so on \u2014 which all made *highly visible* [public investments](https://livingnewdeal.org/) in infrastructure all over the country, and, in so doing, helped build a [political majority](https://jacobin.com/2019/09/bernie-sanders-new-deal-speech-socialism-roosevelt-race-housing-fdr) that lasted generations.\n\n\nThere is one slight problem. When it comes to direct air capture, Robinson Meyer [explains](https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-dioxide-removal-industry-biden), \u201cmost [decarbonization] expertise resides in the private sector.\u201d Under capitalism, private capitalists own and control the means of production \u2014 and for the time being that includes the means of producing machines that suck carbon from the air.\n\n\nBut instead of paying capital to run the machines, the public sector could simply purchase them and run them itself under the CRA mantle. More radically, the state could expropriate DAC technology altogether, given that the \u201cexpertise\u201d is mainly housed in in the same oil and gas industry that is expropriating our atmospheric future.\n\n\nIt is [projected](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/11/1077756/the-us-just-invested-more-than-1-billion-into-carbon-removal/) that the two DAC hubs the Biden administration is funding will create a total of forty-eight hundred jobs. Imagine if those jobs were under the banner of the CRA and framed in terms of \u201cpublic works\u201d rather than private profit. These CRA DAC hubs could also hire oil and gas workers to do what Buck calls \u201c[reverse engineering](https://www.versobooks.com/products/2735-ending-fossil-fuels)\u201d \u2014 we\u2019ve spent roughly two hundred years sucking vast amounts of carbon from underground, and it will take roughly the same skill set and workforce to inject in back underneath. These workers and communities would be enrolled in a wider political project, a real \u201c[just transition](https://jacobin.com/2020/10/oil-gas-workers-just-transition-green-new-deal),\u201d where the government is seen as serving the public good through carbon removal.\n\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing neoliberal capitalism has accomplished, it is the evisceration of the very notion of the public good. If neoliberalism is really \u201c[over](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02632764211036722)\u201d (a [debatable](https://jacobin.com/2022/04/end-of-neoliberalism-think-tanks-lobby-groups) idea), we better have a new vision of public solidarity to replace it.\n\n\nBut, for the most part, [Bidenomics](https://jacobin.com/2023/07/joe-biden-supply-side-liberalism-industrial-policy) has meant injecting cash into capitalist firms rather than rebuilding state capacity. Consequently, those firms carry on their operations with no visible indicator to the public that these \u201cinvestments\u201d are part of a larger *political* program of climate action. For those residing in Texas, it\u2019s simply a continuation of an economic model by and for the Occidental Petroleums of the world.\n\n\n\n\nThe Green New Deal Is Still a Good Idea We Haven\u2019t Really Tried\n===============================================================\n\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s climate investments have created enthusiastic excitement among [policy wonks](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg3781) and the [business press](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2023-02-04), they are having next to no impact on the wider public. Kate Aronoff [explains](https://newrepublic.com/article/174860/public-doesnt-know-well-inflation-reduction-act-working), \u201cA *Washington Post*\u2013University of Maryland [poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2023/08/04/july-13-23-2023-washington-post-university-maryland-climate-poll/) conducted in mid-July found that 57 percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of climate change; 71 percent heard \u2018a little\u2019 or \u2018nothing at all\u2019 about the IRA.\u201d\n\n\nThis is bad news for 2024 (especially since the Right is already planning a [frontal assault](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/climate/republicans-climate-project2025.html) on Biden\u2019s already modest climate program). The original idea for a [Green New Deal](https://www.versobooks.com/products/2546-a-planet-to-win) was to empower the public sector to build the necessary infrastructure and waste management systems to deal with the crisis and expand the welfare state to reverse decades of austerity and attacks on working-class life.\n\n\nThe idea was that only this vast public intervention could create the kind of political majorities needed to sustain long term decarbonization. Bidenomics \u2014 while certainly an improvement over whatever you\u2019d call Barack Obama\u2019s economic program \u2014 seems destined to continue the Democratic Party\u2019s long-standing tradition of being [51 percent losers](https://jacobin.com/2018/11/midterm-elections-reconstruction-du-bois) and the seesaw patterns of partisan gridlock and power swaps between parties. The climate crisis, and [reviving working-class politics](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61b7a8b63fe8c230fa4bbc77/648a64b9a9f037e578cc9166_CWCP_TrumpKryptonite.pdf) more broadly, requires a much more ambitious approach.\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Joe Biden administration has announced two major \u201ccarbon removal\u201d programs to capture and bury carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Making new things is an obvious answer, though it\u2019s still an expensive proposition. Stashing it underground is another, cheaper option; it usually involves compressing and injecting the gas into underground rock formations, kind of like oil drilling in reverse.\n\nBut when it comes to storing carbon underground, there\u2019s another choice that\u2019s even more straightforward: agricultural soils. Farming and ranching [has the potential to store](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SPM.pdf) from 2 billion to 4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide every year for between $45 and $100 per metric ton, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As carbon-removal schemes go, that\u2019s pretty cheap.\n\n\u201cSoil science, for the last 20 years, has been banging their drum to say there\u2019s an enormous opportunity here,\u201d [Yard Stick](https://www.useyardstick.com/) CEO Chris Tolles told TechCrunch+.\n\nBut how much carbon is held by soils \u2014 and how much they capture over time \u2014 is not an easy thing to measure. Most soil sampling is done by hand-digging cores out of the ground and sending the samples to a lab. It\u2019s labor- and time-intensive, which means it\u2019s not cheap.\n\nAs a soil scientist, Yard Stick scientific adviser and research collaborator Cristine Morgan was intimately familiar with it all. For years, she researched how to use probes to characterize soils, reducing the entire process down to one step. By the time Tolles contacted her, the technology was pretty well developed. In the fall of 2020, she, Tolles and chief engineerKevin Meissner founded Yard Stick to commercialize it.\n\nIt works something like this: The probe part sits near the tip of what\u2019s essentially a foot-and-a-half-long drill bit. It uses spectroscopy to determine how much carbon is locked in the soil. That basically means it shines a light on the soil through a sapphire lens and measures what gets reflected. The device samples hundreds of spectral bands, from visible violet light all the way up to near-infrared. The smarts of the unit sit in a case atop the drill bit; it\u2019s a little bit bigger than a rugby ball. The whole thing is then attached to an off-the-shelf cordless drill, and a sample takes less than a minute to complete.\n\nTolles said this version is just the first of many, a proof of concept that will be further refined. Next year, the company plans to build a version that can be attached to the back of a truck, allowing the operator to drive up to a sample site, press a button, and let the rig do the rest of the work.\n\nThe different versions will help the company characterize soils in a range of different environments, but for now, Yard Stick is focusing on farms and ranches.\n\nThe startup recently closed a $10.6 million Series A round, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned. The round was led by Toyota Ventures with participation from the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, the Nature Conservancy, Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Pillar VC.\n\n### Sign up for Newsletters\n\n[See all newsletters(opens in a new window)](https://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters)\n\nDailyWeek in ReviewStartups WeeklyEvent UpdatesAdvertising UpdatesTechCrunch+ AnnouncementsTechCrunch+ EventsTechCrunch+ RoundupEmailSubscribe[twitter(opens in a new window)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25&text=Soil%20can%20store%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%2C%20and%20Yard%20Stick%20wants%20to%20measure%20it%20all&via=techcrunch)[facebook(opens in a new window)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25)[linkedin(opens in a new window)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25&title=Soil%20can%20store%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%2C%20and%20Yard%20Stick%20wants%20to%20measure%20it%20all&summary=Agriculture%20could%20store%202%20billion%20to%204%20billion%20metric%20tons%20of%20CO2%20annually%2C%20but%20first%20we%20have%20to%20know%20which%20farms%20have%20the%20most%20potential.%0A&source=TechCrunch)[reddit(opens in a new window)](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25&title=Soil%20can%20store%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%2C%20and%20Yard%20Stick%20wants%20to%20measure%20it%20all)[mail(opens in a new window)](mailto:?subject=Soil%20can%20store%20gigatons%20of%20carbon%2C%20and%20Yard%20Stick%20wants%20to%20measure%20it%20all&body=Article:%20https://tcrn.ch/44tyy25)Copy Share LinkcheckmarkCopy### Tags\n\n* [EC Food Climate and Sustainability](/tag/ec-food-climate-and-sustainability/)\n* [soil carbon](/tag/soil-carbon/)\n* [Yard Stick](/tag/yard-stick/)\n[TechCrunch](/)plus-bold[Fundraising](/techcrunchplus/fundraising/)[Soil can store gigatons of carbon, and Yard Stick wants to measure it all](/2023/08/17/yard-stick-measure-soil-carbon/)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Tim De Chant](/author/tim-de-chant/)1:00 AM GMT+12\u2022August 18, 2023Agriculture could store 2 billion to 4 billion metric tons of CO2 annually, but first we have to know which farms have the most potential.\n![Scientist samples soil using a portable spectroscope from Yard Stick](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/YardStick-241-1.jpg?w=430&h=230&crop=1)[Space](/category/space/)[SpaceX\u2019s new Bandwagon program is a big threat to small launch providers](/2023/08/18/spacexs-new-bandwagon-program-is-a-big-threat-to-small-launch-providers/)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Aria Alamalhodaei](/author/aria-alamalhodaei/)5:49 AM GMT+12\u2022August 19, 2023SpaceX is expanding its rideshare program with a new series of missions aimed at meeting the demand for launches to mid-inclination orbits.

Electricity generated from clean hydrogen will help reach the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s goals of achieving a zero-carbon American power sector by 2035 and a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.\n\n\n\u201cClean hydrogen is one of our most versatile tools to slash emissions and forge a carbon-free pathway for a sustainable clean energy future,\u201d said\u202f**U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm**. \u201cWith today\u2019s announcements, DOE is supporting the continued advancement of clean hydrogen technology making it cheaper to produce and easier to deploy, all while creating good-paying jobs in the process.\u201d\n\n\nHydrogen is a clean fuel that can be used in a fuel cell or a gas turbine to create electricity with only water and heat as byproducts. Clean hydrogen can be produced from zero-emissions electricity generated by wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear, as well as from conversion of leak-tight natural gas and sustainably sourced biomass with carbon capture and storage. However, currently more than 95% of the roughly 10 million metric tons of hydrogen produced in the United States comes from natural gas without the capture and geologic storage of carbon dioxide, which results in significant emissions. This is why advancing clean hydrogen production is important to help address climate change.\n\n\nDOE\u2019s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), under the purview of DOE\u2019s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), will manage the selected projects. Projects will focus on:\n\n\n* Developing technologies that could help produce clean hydrogen at lower cost and with less energy;\n* Exploring ways to produce hydrogen using biomass, effluent waters from oil and natural gas development and production, and other wastes; and\n* Expanding options for safe and efficient hydrogen transport and storage across the nation.\n\nA detailed list of the selected projects can be found [here](/fecm/additional-selections-funding-opportunity-announcement-2400-clean-hydrogen-production-0).\n\n\nWith the selections announced today, FECM has announced investments of more than $122 million in 72 projects since January 2021 to explore new, clean methods to produce hydrogen and to improve the performance of hydrogen-fueled turbines. These projects support [DOE\u2019s Hydrogen Shot initiative](/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-shot), which seeks to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in one decade to grow new, clean hydrogen pathways in the United States.\n\n\nAs outlined in the [U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/us-national-clean-hydrogen-strategy-roadmap.pdf), achieving commercial-scale hydrogen deployment is critical to building a strong clean energy economy in the United States, while enabling our long-term decarbonization objectives. Estimates indicate that America\u2019s growing hydrogen economy has the potential to add 100,000 net new direct and indirect jobs by 2030.\n\n\nFECM minimizes environmental and climate impacts of fossil fuels and industrial processes while working to achieve net-zero emissions across our economy. Priority areas of technology work include carbon capture, carbon conversion, carbon dioxide removal, carbon dioxide transport and storage, hydrogen production with carbon management, methane emissions reduction, and critical minerals production.

Explore our global CO2 strategy with Lorenzo Bernasconi, Callum Lee and Ruben Lubowski, from our Climate and Environmental Solutions Team at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.\n\n \u00a0\n\n ### How do carbon markets work?\u2005 What is their objective?\n\n Carbon markets are a tool for achieving cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. By putting a price on carbon, and creating a financial value for emissions reduction, carbon markets encourage investments and business models that favour cleaner technologies and practices.\n\n The [global carbon market](https://www.lombardodier.com/home/rethink-sustainability/the-global-carbon-market-opportu.html) is, in reality, two markets \u2013 regulated carbon offsets and voluntary carbon offsets \u2013 which together are estimated to be worth close to USD 1 trillion. In regulated markets, businesses must buy and surrender government certificates to cover each tonne of CO2 emitted as a result of their activities. A predetermined number of certificates are put up for auction by governments each year. This number is then reduced over time to limit availability and make pollution more costly. Businesses that do not comply must pay a fine that is significantly higher than the price of a certificate.\n\n The European carbon market successfully reduced electric power sector emissions by 43% between 2005 and 2021 What makes this concept so smart is that it puts a cap on total pollution and leaves it to the market to find the most effective way of reducing emissions. Regulated markets have proved to be highly successful \u2013 for example, the European carbon market succeeded in reducing the electric power sector\u2019s emissions by 43% between 2005 and 2021, without any adverse impact on GDP growth. This success has driven strong market growth over the past few years.\n\n Read also: [\u2018Net-zero economic growth\u2019 need not be a contradiction](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/responsible-capital/2021/september/net-zero-economic-growth-need-no.html)\n\n The voluntary market operates on the basis of carbon-removal projects. In nature-based carbon removal projects developers often buy or lease land for planting trees with the aim of reducing the quantity of carbon in the atmosphere. They then apply for a credit corresponding to the CO2 reduction achieved over the period concerned. These credits may then be sold to investors, who can \u2018offset\u2019 the credited carbon reductions against their own emissions in order to achieve their climate objectives. The voluntary market is primarily intended for businesses committed to\u2005\u2018net zero\u2019, who currently represent an economic strength of USD 38 trillion in terms of stock market capitalisation1. This market will also play an increasing role in meeting country commitments under the Paris Agreement. Driven by these trends, the voluntary market is growing apace. In addition to its role in reducing emissions, the market is also important due to its on-the-ground role in preserving some of the world\u2019s most ecologically-essential ecologies \u2013 it is the key to mobilising the necessary funding for [nature conservation and restoration](https://www.lombardodier.com/home/rethink-sustainability/investing-in-our-natural-capital.html).\n\n \u00a0\n\n ### What are the factors to be considered when it comes to\u2005the future of carbon pricing?\n\n We have extensive modelling expertise and apply a quantitative and probability-based approach to predicting the price of carbon. In other words, we conduct a fundamental modelling analysis, before examining the various political scenarios and market catalysts in order to formulate our short and medium-term price projections. We also benefit from the expert research provided by Lombard Odier \u2013 such as the Climate Value Impact (CVI) analyses, which provide a highly granular view of future emissions and reduction solutions \u2013 which is then fed into our models.\n\n Read also: [The unexpected portfolio \u2013 a holistic approach to investing for net zero](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/ft-rethink/2021/september/the-unexpected-portfolio--a-holi.html)\n\n \u00a0\n\n ### How are the risks associated with carbon market investment managed? And what are the most common risks that investors should be aware of?\n\n A number of risks need to be factored in when investing in carbon. The first is the possibility that governments might cut back their climate change efforts. There is also the risk presented by economic factors, such as a major recession, that might affect demand for carbon credits as a result of lower industrial production. Diversification is the key to managing these risks. Our strategy draws on an extensive investment universe in terms of both markets and instruments and strategies, thereby minimising the impact of such risks. We have in-depth knowledge of the quality of the various standards applying in this area. We also analyse specific projects in conjunction with leading credit rating agencies.\n\n According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group, carbon markets could see a sixfold increase in size between now and 2030 Read also: [Putting an end to deforestation \u2013 starting local, going global](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/ft-rethink/2022/august/putting-an-end-to-deforestation-.html)\n\n    ###  Sign up for our newsletter\n\n        Email Please enter a valid email address.\n\n        Mr Mrs Select an Option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Title       Firstname Please enter your firstname.\n\n      Lastname Please enter your lastname.\n\n          Switzerland France United Kingdom Spain Italy United Arab Emirates Singapore   Afghanistan \u00c5land Islands Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Brunei Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Cape Verde Cayman Islands Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos Islands Colombia Comoros Congo Cook Islands Costa Rica C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Croatia Cuba Cura\u00e7ao Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Falkland Islands Faroe Islands Fiji Finland France French Guiana French Polynesia French Southern Territories Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland Grenada Guadeloupe Guam Guatemala Guernsey Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Heard Island And McDonald Islands Honduras Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Isle Of Man Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jersey Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Laos Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macao Macedonia Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Martinique Mauritania Mauritius Mayotte Mexico Micronesia Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Montserrat Morocco Mozambique Myanmar Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands Netherlands Antilles New Caledonia New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue Norfolk Island North Korea Northern Mariana Islands Norway Oman Pakistan Palau Palestine Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Pitcairn Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Reunion Romania Russia Rwanda Saint Barth\u00e9lemy Saint Helena Saint Kitts And Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Martin Saint Pierre And Miquelon Saint Vincent And The Grenadines Samoa San Marino Sao Tome And Principe Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Sint Maarten (Dutch part) Slovakia Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa South Georgia And The South Sandwich Islands South Korea South Sudan Spain Sri Lanka Sudan Suriname Svalbard And Jan Mayen Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syria Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand The Democratic Republic Of Congo Timor-Leste Togo Tokelau Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks And Caicos Islands Tuvalu U.S. Virgin Islands Uganda Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States Minor Outlying Islands Uruguay Uzbekistan Vanuatu Vatican Venezuela Vietnam Wallis And Futuna Western Sahara Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe  Select an Option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Country of residence  Please select your country.\n\n     I'm not a US resident or citizen  This field is mandatory.\n\n         register now    Something happened, message not sent.         ### How do you see the carbon markets evolving in the coming years?\n\n We believe that the carbon markets will continue to expand over the coming years \u2013 this growth will be seen particularly in new markets, such as China, South Korea and Australia. According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group, carbon markets could see a sixfold increase in size between now and 2030. We believe that the expansion of these markets presents significant opportunities for investors, given that these new markets will impose much more restrictive emissions caps. At the same time, we also think that the pressure exerted to achieve climate objectives will be a major driving factor. At present, carbon prices are negotiated at the global level and are well below the price required to achieve our current climate objectives, which are increasingly being enshrined in legislation. This highlights the need for a fivefold increase in the carbon price within the next few years.\n\n Finally, we also examine the impact that implementation of the Paris Agreement will have on the voluntary carbon market. Most countries are likely to make use of the carbon markets to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, and this paves the way to an exciting new carbon credits market which we intend to monitor closely.\n\n Read also: [Challenge or opportunity? Rethinking hard-to-abate sectors](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/responsible-capital/2021/september/challenge-or-opportunity-rethink.html)\n\n \u00a0\n\n ### What is so exciting about these opportunities?\n\n Although the market has more than doubled in size since 2019, less than a quarter of global emissions are tied to a price. As the Lombard\u00a0Odier 3+1 framework2\u00a0shows, carbon emissions pricing will be the key to [achieving global \u2018net zero\u2019](https://www.lombardodier.com/home/rethink-sustainability/net-zero.html). Carbon markets and the creation of a [CLIC\u00ae economy](https://www.lombardodier.com/clic) (one that is Circular, Lean, Inclusive and Clean) will be the most effective tools for achieving this.\n\n To date, carbon markets have consisted almost exclusively of participants that are compelled to use them \u2013 this has created inefficiencies. In addition, in many of the largest global economies carbon markets have barely seen the light of day. We think that they have the potential to increase significantly. These are perhaps the most exciting opportunities for investment presented by climate transition.\n\n Carbon prices on the principal markets have been one of the most profitable asset classes over the last five years ### Why should investors consider including carbon credits in their investment portfolios?\n\n Firstly, there is the possibility of obtaining attractive returns. Carbon prices on the principal markets have been one of the most profitable asset classes over the last five years. They also have excellent advantages in terms of portfolio diversification thanks to their low correlation with other asset classes. Also, many carbon markets price in inflation protection \u2013 for instance, the carbon price cap in California has increased every year by 5% more than the consumer price index.\n\n Further, a number of analyses conducted in this area suggest that just a small allocation to carbon markets is sufficient to protect the rest of a global portfolio against the adverse financial effects associated with the global climate transition. Currently, most portfolios are primarily positioned to benefit from carbon in the short term and from climate change in the long term, which makes the addition of carbon a very attractive proposition.\n\n   \n \u00a0\n\n 1SBTI, May 2022: Companies committed to cutting emissions in line with climate science now represent USD $38 trillion in terms of the global economy - Science Based Targets  \n 2\u00a0Energy, land, oceans and materials.\n\n     Important information\n---------------------\n\n  This document is issued by Bank Lombard Odier & Co Ltd or an entity of the Group (hereinafter \u201cLombard Odier\u201d).

This positions them prominently as one of the most significant producers of carbon credits.**\n\n\nA breakdown of these figures reveals that HeavyFinance aims to counteract a colossal 250,000 tonnes of CO2 in our atmosphere. This commendable initiative will be realised through sustainable investment avenues and leveraging Article 9 funds. These resources will be accessible to both retail and institutional investors.\n\n\nThis investment scheme intends to accrue capital for promoting no-tillage farming methods and other sustainable agricultural techniques. The broader vision encompasses addressing the persistent food shortage issue plaguing Europe, while simultaneously contributing to CO2 reduction.\n\n\nDigging deeper, Poland, Lithuania, and Bulgaria emerge as the primary beneficiaries of this initiative. HeavyFinance seeks to tap into their robust carbon removal capacities. The plan is set to roll out progressively across other European nations over a span of 18 months, dovetailing seamlessly with these countries\u2019 national carbon reduction objectives.\n\n\nEryk Frontczak, Carbon Product Manager at HeavyFinance, remarked, \u201cSetting out attainable goals and commitments is an important part of tackling climate issues and the generation of 250,000 carbon credits will bring actionable benefits across Europe. Countries such as Poland have huge potential for carbon reduction through sustainable farming, helping to prioritise soil health which contributes to the food market, generate new revenue streams through carbon credits, build climate resilience and maximise agricultural yield.\u201d\n\n\nBuilding on their commitment, HeavyFinance has unveiled Green Loans, enticing investors with a potential 30% annual return over a span of four years. This would be powered by the sales of CO2 removal credits sourced from European agricultural territories.\n\n\nLaimonas Noreika, CEO & Co-Founder of HeavyFinance, added: \u201cCarbon reduction is becoming increasingly important as organisations evaluate and implement ESG strategies, and raising awareness of the carbon credit market and Article 9 funds is a vital step in the carbon removal and reduction process.\n\n\n\u201cCollaboration with European institutions to promote the value of carbon credits in sustainability action is an essential part of the solution and our capacity to generate 250,000 carbon credits will help towards our goal of removing one gigaton of CO2 emissions by 2050.\u201d\n\n\nTo fortify their position, HeavyFinance has forged alliances with UK\u2019s Agricarbon to evaluate climate ramifications and with ClearBlue Markets, a notable carbon pricing consultant and offset development agency.\n\n\nKeep up with all the latest FinTech news [here](https://fintech.global/category/fintech-news/).\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 FinTech Global\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoying the stories?\n\n\nSubscribe to our daily FinTech newsletter and get the latest industry news & research\n\n\n\n\n![](https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ipad-pro-mockup-with-a-solid-color-backdrop-988-el_1-300x225.webp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "HeavyFinance has committed to generating 250,000 carbon credits within the UK and European domains by 2024 through sustainable investments.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The commitment to generating carbon credits and promoting sustainable farming techniques is commendable and contributes to CO2 reduction."}, {"summary": "The investment scheme aims to promote no-tillage farming methods and address food shortage issues in Europe.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The investment scheme addresses important agricultural challenges and contributes to CO2 reduction."}, {"summary": "The primary beneficiaries of this initiative are Poland, Lithuania, and Bulgaria, which have robust carbon removal capacities.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The initiative taps into countries with significant carbon reduction potential and aligns with their national objectives."}, {"summary": "HeavyFinance has unveiled Green Loans offering a potential 30% annual return over four years, powered by sales of CO2 removal credits.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The Green Loans offer provides an attractive investment opportunity and supports the sales of CO2 removal credits."}, {"summary": "HeavyFinance has forged alliances with Agricarbon and ClearBlue Markets to evaluate climate ramifications and carbon pricing.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The alliances demonstrate a commitment to assessing climate impacts and establishing partnerships in carbon markets."}], "semantic_commentary": "Relates to intent: HeavyFinance sells carbon credits for carbon emissions reduction.\nComment: Promotes carbon removal through sustainable investments and farming methods.", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions HeavyFinance committing to generating carbon credits and purchasing carbon credits."}]}, {"source": "The Ecologist", "link": "https://theecologist.org/2023/aug/18/discrediting-carbon-credits", "title": "Discrediting carbon credits", "content": "Carbon credit certifiers, in principle, guarantee that any emissions avoidance project brings real climate benefits.\u00a0\n\nThe key to issuing carbon credits from a REDD+ project is determining the baseline deforestation rate in reference areas that have similar characteristics.\u00a0\n\nThe observed deforestation rate of the project area is then subtracted from the baseline to determine the \u201cadditionality\u201d - prevented deforestation - that has resulted from the implementation of the project.\n\n**REDD+ projects sell \u201cworthless\u201d carbon credits**\n\nHowever, a [joint investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) by *The Guardian*, *Die Zeit* and *SourceMaterial* has revealed that 94 per cent of REDD+ carbon offsets certified by the world\u2019s leading carbon credit certifier Verra are \u201cworthless\u201d.\u00a0\n\nBasically, the baseline scenarios are cherry-picked and the forest conservation programmes bring no measurable additional CO2 avoidance.\u00a0\n\nVerra receives a commission for each credit they approve, creating a clear conflict of interest that incentivises the overestimation of carbon credits that can be sold.\n\nCritics have for a long time posited that carbon offsets are nothing more than hot air to allow the fossil fuel industry to sell [guilt-free fossil fuels](https://theconversation.com/a-tonne-of-fossil-carbon-isnt-the-same-as-a-tonne-of-new-trees-why-offsets-cant-save-us-200901). Even some carbon credit brokers themselves have called carbon neutral fossil fuels \u201c[obvious nonsense](https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/technology-science/how-to-sell-carbon-neutral-fossil-fuel-that-doesnt-exist/)\".\n\nIn the four recent case studies added to the EJAtlas, each REDD+ project investigated was found to have an \u201cinflated baseline\u201d which greatly exaggerated deforestation prevention.\n\nIn the cases of the [Cordillera Azul National Park](https://ejatlas.org/conflict/cordillera-azul-national-park-canp-peru) (PNCAZ) in Peru and the [Matav\u00e9n Jungle Indigenous Reservation](https://ejatlas.org/conflict/redd-project-resguardo-indigena-unificado-selva-de-mataven-riu-sm) in Colombia, researchers found no \u201cadditionality\u201d because the areas were already guaranteed legal protective status prior to the establishment of the REDD+ projects.\n\nIn other words, the carbon project cannot stop deforestation in an area that already has functioning preventative measures in place.\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, in the cases of [Kariba REDD+](https://ejatlas.org/conflict/the-kariba-redd-project-in-zimbabwe) in Zimbabwe and the [Luangwa Community Forest Project](https://ejatlas.org/conflict/luangwa-community-forests-project-lcfp-redd) in Zambia, the project's areas are located around National Parks that have protected status. In Luangwa, the main drivers of deforestation of the reference area were found to be totally different from that of the project area.\n\n**Local communities receive few economic benefits**\n\nRevenues from the sales of carbon offsets are meant to benefit the communities living within the project area by providing alternatives to livelihoods that are theoretically causing deforestation.\n\nHowever, it is common for carbon brokers that mediate between private companies and the organisations managing the offsetting projects to take a significant portion of the sales.\n\nThe carbon credit broker South Pole, which advises Verra, also receives a commission for each credit sold to international buyers.\u00a0\n\nSouth Pole came under scrutiny after [it was found](https://reddmonitor.substack.com/p/south-pole-and-the-kariba-redd-project) that one of its flagship projects, Kariba REDD+, issued up to 30 times more credits than it should have. Investigations revealed that South Pole executives knew this was a problem, and some employees even resigned due to the disclosures.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, South Pole earned 73 per cent more in commissions from Kariba REDD+ than was formally agreed upon through carbon market speculation.\n\nThe NGOs and enterprises that implemented the REDD+ projects in all four case studies have unverifiable financial distribution contracts.\n\nThese intermediaries are meant to ensure the revenues from sales of credits are distributed to the communities through legally binding agreements, but because there are no regulators, territorial communities are vulnerable to being taken advantage of by project promoters.\n\nIn both cases in Africa, the project enterprises were found to be registered in tax havens, and even a cryptocurrency was set up in a tax haven to sell credits originating from the Kariba REDD+ project.\n\nIn the case of PNCAZ, the Kichwa communities lack clarity on the sales of carbon credits and received no financial or economic benefits at all from the NGO that manages the project.\n\nOpaque financial transactions leave a giant gap in accountability that makes the intended indigenous and territorial community beneficiaries the potential victims of embezzlement.\n\n**Local communities\u2019 basic needs and traditions are denied**\n\nIn PNCAZ, some farming communities were removed from the land to make way for the protected area, and instead of removing some Kichwa villages, the boundaries of the park were drawn specifically to exclude them from the protected area.\n\nFor these Kichwa communities, that meant that they were no longer allowed to hunt, fish, forage or farm on their ancestral territory without official permits that limit the number of days they can enter the protected area, leading to a loss of livelihood and even to malnutrition in some cases.\n\nKichwa communities also suffer encroachment onto their territories by illegal loggers and coca farmers, and when community members report these instances, they are ignored by the local authorities because they have no legally recognized land tenure rights. Even still, Kichwa community members have received death threats from the drug traffickers so that they will stay silent.\u00a0\n\nIn Kariba and Luangwa, the case studies revealed disenfranchisement of local communities with regard to project governance.\u00a0\n\nCommunity members do not understand the project and are losing their traditional relationship to their territories due to fear of armed patrols and restrictions on who can use the land for foraging or hunting. Yet these restrictions do not apply to paying customers who travel to the project areas for safari tourism.\u00a0\n\nIn the case of Luangwa, Eni has even gone so far as to become a governing partner of the REDD+ project, while failing to deliver on its promises to the residents.\u00a0\n\nThis year, an Italian news crew found the oil giant built a new classroom in Luangwa but refused to entrust the building to the school, leaving it empty for over a year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**The right to free, prior and informed consent is violated**\n\nFree, prior and informed consent (FPIC) processes with local communities are required by UN standards for setting up REDD+ projects.\u00a0\n\nHowever, in the case of PNCAZ, Kichwa communities won a lawsuit in April of this year against the Peruvian government for violating their FPIC rights, leading the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to formally demand urgent action from the state.\u00a0\n\nIn Luangwa, one of the project partners, USAID, even admitted that the FPIC process was insufficient, and in all of the case studies, the territorial communities did not understand the abstract concept of carbon credits.\u00a0\n\nThe question remains: would any community consent if they understood that selling carbon offsets is justifying more emissions and ultimately threatening the long-term survival of their territories due to consequences of rising temperatures and extreme weather events?\n\nIn the case of the Matav\u00e9n reservation, the 16 indigenous communities created a political structure which helped them win constitutionally recognized land tenure rights prior to initiating the REDD+ project in their territory.\u00a0\n\nOf the four case studies, this was the defining factor that reduced negative effects and maximised benefits of the carbon project for the 6 First Nations stewarding the land.\u00a0\n\nEven still, some interviews with local people revealed complaints of a narrow view of conservation affecting traditional indigenous practices and knowledge, which studies have found are vital to maintaining biodiversity.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**No to carbon offsets, yes to climate debt**\n\nThe REDD+ carbon offset projects not only sell hot-air carbon credits that justify the perpetuation of the fossil fuel model.\u00a0\n\nThey also reproduce historical injustices and asymmetrical power relationships where the wealthy, white and western minorities profit, and indigenous racialized communities, mostly in the Global South, suffer the impacts.\n\nIt is an extension of the logic that has seen a minority reaping the benefits of the fossil system over the last century and a half, while a majority is left to suffer the worst impacts of the climate and ecological crisis.\n\nThe wealthy and western elites have incurred a climate and ecological debt with all those people who have contributed little to the current crisis, but are the first and most affected by it.\n\nFor anyone striving for a safer climate and global justice, it is imperative to oppose voluntary carbon markets and their use to make fraudulent carbon neutral claims by fossil fuel companies.\n\nIn parallel, the worst climate offenders must be required to pay local communities defending the forest, not as a *quid pro quo*, not as a carbon offset, but as a climate and ecological debt.\n\n**These Authors**\n\nNathaniel Rugh and Marcel Llavero-Pasquina are researchers at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB) and members of the Global Environmental Justice Atlas team.

Now, his government is turning its focus to other sources of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLegislation coming before Congress this month would structure the new carbon market around a cap on companies emitting more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, Dubeux said in an interview on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continueThe cap would hit oil and gas firms, along with meatpackers and steel, cement and aluminum producers, he said, adding that affected firms make up just 0.1% of Brazilian companies, but produce nearly half of emissions.\n\nAfter passing Congress, the regulations would require two years of emissions monitoring before the cap takes effect. At that point, companies cutting emissions faster than required can generate credits to trade on an exchange with those struggling to keep pace.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continueCompanies could also offset their emissions with credits generated with reforestation projects, Dubeux said.\n\nReforestation and conservation projects in Brazil are already offering companies a way to voluntarily offset their emissions. But Dubeux said the lack of regulation has created an opening for irresponsible \"carbon cowboys\" who take advantage of some participants.\n\nFor example, some developers have approached indigenous communities with unfair contracts offering meager payments, he said. The proposed legislation would establish criteria for such deals, guaranteeing broad consensus and equitable terms for indigenous communities involved.\n\nLula has pitched the sweeping [green transition plan](/world/americas/brazil-launches-growth-acceleration-plan-set-invest-350-bln-2023-08-11/) as a centerpiece of his third non-consecutive term.

As a DPG, the registry uses\u00a0open-source code, which allows countries to replicate and adapt the information to fit their own needs and contexts. The registry\u2019s modules, software and technical documentation can be reused and tailored by countries, which could potentially reduce production costs and implementation timelines.\u00a0\n\n\u201cTo achieve our ambitious Global Goals for the planet, we need to take an open and informed approach to digital technology that promotes integration and collaboration between different sectors and actors. We must also consider how we can work together to build digital public infrastructure (DPI) that is safe, sustainable, and inclusive for all,\u201d UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said.  \n  \nThe registry follows national and international best practices based on inputs from countries and is a result of ongoing work by the\u00a0Digital4Climate (D4C) Working Group, which includes UNDP, the World Bank, the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) among others. The initiative is also supported by a\u00a0community of practice for knowledge exchange.\u00a0\n\nBuilt as an interoperable digital system, it can be integrated with national measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) systems and international digital systems such as UNDP\u2019s voluntary cooperation platform and the global platform Climate Action Data Trust (CAD Trust) launched by the World Bank. This can result in\u00a0a broader suite of digital public infrastructure to address climate challenges.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeveloping carbon markets is an investment in our sustainable future. Digital market infrastructure will be critical to scale-up high integrity, transparent carbon markets that can be used by countries to increase the level of climate action and ambition. This is why the World Bank\u2019s Climate Warehouse programme is working closely with our partners on the implementation of this open-source carbon registry platform,\u201d commented Juergen Voegele, Vice President for Sustainable Development, World Bank.\u00a0\n\nUNDP and partners are actively exploring how DPI \u2013 of which some solutions can be DPGs \u2013 might apply to address issues related to nature, climate and energy. This is especially critical to counter the current trend of monolithic software implementations and siloed systems.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis initiative is a valuable opportunity for countries to work together towards a shared good with potential benefits beyond the open-source registry system. We look forward to engaging with the evolution of ideas and testing of approaches that can inform the arrangements of any country implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement,\u201d said Mr. James Grabert, Director of Mitigation Division at UNFCCC.\n\nEffective climate action requires concerted and sufficient investment. Developing countries will need more than US$6 trillion by 2030 to finance their climate action goals (as listed in their Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs).\u00a0\n\nCarbon finance is key for the implementation of the NDCs, and the Paris Agreement enables the use of market mechanisms through provisions in Article 6.\u00a0For this reason, interest in carbon markets is growing around the world, with 83 percent of NDCs stating the intent to make use of international market mechanisms to reduce GHG emissions.\u00a0However, until now, there has not been an open-source software that allowed countries to start their own national registry to issue and manage carbon credits.\u00a0\n\n*Development of the National Carbon Registry has benefited from the contribution of the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) and the Government of Japan.\u00a0UNDP\u2019s voluntary cooperation platform and the World Bank\u2019s Climate Warehouse Program were both funded by the Government of Switzerland.*\n\n------\n\n**About UNDP\u2019s Climate Promise Initiative:**\n\n[UNDP's Climate Promise(link is external)](https://climatepromise.undp.org/) is the largest offer of support to developing countries on their pledges under the Paris Agreement, or NDCs.\u00a0 Having supported enhancement processes in 85 percent of all developing country NDCs, UNDP is now also supporting efforts for implementing these pledges and building key components for monitoring and reporting on their NDCs through\u00a0[strengthened data and transparency(link is external)](https://climatepromise.undp.org/what-we-do/areas-of-work/transparency).\n\n**About UNDP\u2019s DPI approach:**\n\nUNDP works with countries to\u00a0[build strong and interoperable digital public infrastructure](https://www.undp.org/digital/digital-public-infrastructure) (DPI).

Emissions trading is an approach to controlling pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is used to reduce or control pollution to protect human health and the environment. An emissions trading system allows countries and companies that emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to buy/sell these emissions among themselves. Emissions trading works by setting the environmental goal, national or sometimes regional. Such programs provide affected sources with the flexibility to choose among many options to comply with the environmental goal. Emissions trading is a cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  \n\n\n **Key Trends and Analysis of the Global** **Emissions Trading** **Market:**\n\n Increasing adoption of carbon pricing mechanisms or systems is one of the key trends expected to augment the growth of the global emissions trading market. For instance, more countries or regions across the globe are implementing carbon pricing mechanisms, such as emissions trading systems, to control or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon pricing (CO2 pricing) is a method/approach used to address climate change. Its overarching goal is to protect the environment, discourage the use of carbon dioxide-emitting fossil fuels, and address the causes of climate change to meet both the national or international climate agreements.\n\n Several governments around the world have adopted norms to promote the use of emissions trading programs or systems. For instance, EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU's policy to combat climate change and its key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively. EU ETS represents over 90% of the global compliance carbon markets and in 2022 traded volume amounted to 9,277 MtCO2e representing \u20ac751.5 billion in value. The EU ETS is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, as the European Union (EU) commits to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. This in turn is expected to drive market growth.\n\n **Read full market research report, \"[Emissions Trading Market Size, Share, Growth, By Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) Type, By Geographical Coverage, By Covered Sectors, By Tradable Emission Units, Outlook, and Opportunity Analysis, 2023 - 2030](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=u9i2gZn_qnMJmQO1j-RY5j4VFfATKnNuFCr2AaSbIbkwlhG5nPQcV3gl6t3BVb2rw7DpWvqBQf7jtvIiyXaXAO41rWKDdgAUc3RyVFjofOvYD-Eg5f9t8UL-JZB8sEgJ4FSzNHKESOOwuX462de0a84pTh48XcKwXM4V4Ho19SanrwOzmnF6upMX7K-G_aaEOQMkd52epzBbut25n-E0Sjl6wm_tkjPOcln6f6CDA4vzZuzPqqOv0uoO4siTY56te2v79PRT5v_llYJWtUeZ855Qm1elFxmCIPiT4xjQr9AKwOsK_-839ogPACbQm8W-Tl55vcLL7hqYgiZxc1Vqj_e5xNMpowDqggYqDl5jSRij4Okh9j1OT71vzARtHQAj0XC5uELFlpGiN9C9gWcL3FMofS2hdI-ANfdDLcBQTt0= \"Emissions Trading Market Size, Share, Growth, By Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) Type, By Geographical Coverage, By Covered Sectors, By Tradable Emission Units, Outlook, and Opportunity Analysis, 2023 - 2030\")****\", published by Coherent Market Insights.**\n\n **Increasing carbon** **emissions to augment the market growth** \n\n With the rapid growth in carbon emissions (also referred to as greenhouse gas or GHG emissions) across the globe, the implementation of emission trading program or system is also increasing with the rapid pace. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes grew 0.9% or 321 Mt in 2022 to a new all-time high of 36.8 Gt. The lobal energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021 to 36.3 billion tons, their highest ever level, as the world economy rebounded strongly from COVID-19 crisis and relied heavily on coal to power that growth.\n\n **Emissions Trading Market Report Coverage**\n\n \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Report\u00a0Attribute** | **Details** |\n| **Market size value in 2023** | **US$ 334.8 B****illio****n** |\n| **Forecast Period:** | **2023 to 2030** |\n| **Growth rate** | **CAGR of 24****% from 2023 to 2030** |\n| **Base year for estimation** | **2022** |\n| **Historical data** | **2018****-\u00a02021** |\n| **Forecast period** | **2023\u00a0-\u00a02030** |\n\n **Global** **Emissions Trading** **Market** **- Key Developments**\n\n In February 2023, the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) launched a mandatory, intensity-based emissions trading system (ETS) for the power generation sector. The new system will cover facilities with a production capacity of more than 100 MW, though smaller coal and fossil fuel plants may also be included at a later point.\n\n In July 2021, China planned to launch its national emissions-trading program, a system that would create the world\u2019s largest carbon market and double the share of global emissions covered under such programs.\n\n **Detailed Segmentation:**\n\n * **Global Emissions Trading Market, By Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) Type:**\n\t+ Cap-and-Trade\n\t+ Emissions Reduction Credit (ERC) Trading\n\t+ Offset and Credit Trading\n* **Global Emissions Trading Market, By Geographical Coverage:**\n\t+ Regional Emissions Trading Schemes\n\t+ National Emissions Trading Schemes\n\t+ International Emissions Trading Mechanisms\n* **Global Emissions Trading Market, By Covered Sectors:**\n\t+ Energy and Power Generation\n\t+ Industrial Processes\n\t+ Transportation\n\t+ Agriculture and Land Use\n* **Global Emissions Trading Market, By Tradable Emission Units:**\n\t+ Carbon Allowances\n\t+ Carbon Offsets\n\t+ Emission Reduction Units (ERUs)\n\t+ Certified Emission Reductions (CERs)\n* **Global Emissions Trading Market, By Compliance vs. Voluntary Markets:**\n\t+ Compliance Markets\n\t+ Voluntary Markets\n* **Global Emissions Trading Market, By Time Frame and Phases:**\n\t+ Phases of Emission Trading Schemes\n\t+ Carbon Budgets\n* **Global Emissions Trading Market, By Technology Type:**\n\t+ Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)\n\t+ Renewable Energy Projects\n* **Global Emissions Trading Market, By Region:**\n\t+ North America\n\t\t- U.S.\n\t\t- Canada\n\t+ Europe\n\t\t- U.K.\n\t\t- Germany\n\t\t- Italy\n\t\t- France\n\t\t- Russia\n\t\t- Rest of Europe\n\t+ Asia Pacific\n\t\t- China\n\t\t- India\n\t\t- Japan\n\t\t- ASEAN\n\t\t- Australia\n\t\t- South Korea\n\t\t- Rest of Asia Pacific\n\t+ Latin America\n\t\t- Brazil\n\t\t- Mexico\n\t\t- Rest of Latin America\n\t+ Middle East\n\t\t- GCC\n\t\t- Israel\n\t\t- Rest of Middle East\n\t+ Africa\n\t\t- Northern Africa\n\t\t- Central Africa\n\t\t- South Africa\n* **Company Profile:**\n\t+ BP Plc\n\t+ Royal Dutch Shell Plc\n\t+ Total SE\n\t+ Chevron Corporation\n\t+ ExxonMobil Corporation\n\t+ Engie SA\n\t+ RWE AG\n\t+ ON SE\n\t+ Vattenfall AB\n\t+ Gazprom\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG)\n\t+ JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\t+ Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n\t+ Citigroup Inc.\n\t+ Barclays PLC\n\n **Related Market Intelligence Reports:**\n\n [SSL Certificate Market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Wi432Czlt9bysHXcmv4oidn_WKxPou9iTT_1nc3mKYKPl0LSPUVxGT8SxZhHr3uZvyg7DQwWCZo70PWh8fNJgWhzc_3KFYXoSBgy-Qx5Ti-sXehW275O7AqflRT0bvlYApFEPsbwSS1ScxZVju2MMT9tZWJAqXaShgX9wi7s1Sk= \"SSL Certificate Market\"), By Certificate Type, By Validation Level, By Encryption Strength, By Use Case, By Industry Vertical, By Certificate Authority, By Validation Process, By Subscription Duration, By Organization Size, By Service Model, By End User, By Emerging Technologies, By Regulatory Compliance, By Geography (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa) -

In strengthening the financial and reputational protections available to corporate buyers of carbon credits, Oka is seeking to revolutionize an industry \u2014 and climate \u2014 in crisis.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the partnership, **Chris Slater, Oka Founder and CEO** said: \"This is a crucial milestone in our journey towards ensuring every carbon credit is insured. Sylvera's rating expertise complements our pricing and underwriting capabilities, enabling us to deliver tailored carbon insurance solutions. Together, we look forward to bringing much-needed trust and transparency to the voluntary carbon market.\"\n\n\n**Samuel Gill, Sylvera Co-founder and President**, said \"Insurers like Oka help reduce the risk burden from carbon credit buyers, a hugely important component of ensuring that the carbon markets are an effective mechanism for funding real climate action. However, accurately modeling risk requires the best data available\u2013Sylvera makes that easier. With Sylvera's carbon data, insurers like Oka can make better decisions about the risks associated for more accurate underwriting.\"\n\n[About Oka, The Carbon Insurance Company\u2122](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3946840-1&h=1071666476&u=https%3A%2F%2Fcarboninsurance.co%2Fabout-us%2F&a=About+Oka%2C+The+Carbon+Insurance+Company%E2%84%A2)\n\n[About Sylvera](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3946840-1&h=3281530458&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sylvera.com%2Fabout-us&a=About+Sylvera)\n\n**Follow Oka, The Carbon Insurance Company\u2122**\n\n[LinkedIn](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3946840-1&h=97616968&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Foka-the-carbon-insurance-company%2F&a=LinkedIn)\n\nChris Slater  \n[chris.slater@carboninsurance.co](mailto:chris.slater@carboninsurance.co)\n\nSOURCE Oka, The Carbon Insurance Company\n\n![](https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA86973&Transmission_Id=202308170900PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA86973&DateId=20230817)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n### Modal title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso from this source\n---------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Oka, The Carbon Insurance Company\u2122, Announces Over $7M in Seed Funding for Carbon Credit Insurance Platform](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2007986/Oka_Logo.jpg?p=thumbnail)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oka-the-carbon-insurance-company-announces-over-7m-in-seed-funding-for-carbon-credit-insurance-platform-301754392.html)\n\n\n### \n[Oka, The Carbon Insurance Company\u2122, Announces Over $7M in Seed Funding for Carbon Credit Insurance Platform](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oka-the-carbon-insurance-company-announces-over-7m-in-seed-funding-for-carbon-credit-insurance-platform-301754392.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore\n-------\n\n\nMore news releases in similar topics\n\n\n* [Banking & Financial Services](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/financial-services-latest-news/banking-financial-services-list/)\n* [Insurance](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/financial-services-latest-news/insurance-list/)\n* [Computer & Electronics](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/business-technology-latest-news/computer-electronics-list/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](/content/dam/prnewswire/common/newsletter-signup.png)\n\n\n\nPRN Top Stories Newsletters\n---------------------------\n\n\nSign up to get PRN\u2019s top stories and curated news delivered to your inbox weekly!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter Your Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Country\nUnited StatesCanadaUnited KingdomSwedenAfghanistan\u00c5land IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBrit/Indian Ocean Terr.Brunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCongoCongo, The Dem.

ABC News", "content": "Deep in the Australian outback, there are billions of dollars being made from carbon farming.\n\nRemote stations that used to farm sheep or cattle are now doing nothing on their land \u2014\u00a0and that's the intention.\n\nIt's called Human Induced Regeneration (HIR) and while it's Australia's most popular method of carbon farming, it's also controversial.\n\nThe premise is simple \u2013 encourage Australian forests to regenerate, to help draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\n![IMG_1506](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8d42b1e35a8ba3776c7dbb0a03c6a490?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2688&cropW=4032&xPos=0&yPos=168&width=862&height=575) Human Induced Regeneration aims to allow forests to regenerate.\u00a0(ABC News: Ashlynne McGhee)Unlike other methods of carbon farming, it doesn't involve planting trees. Rather, landholders are paid to stop whatever activity has been suppressing tree growth, whether that's clearing, grazing, farming, or feral animals, so that forests can regenerate.\n\nEvery tonne of carbon dioxide stored in these trees is worth one carbon credit, which can then be sold to the government or a business that wants to offset its emissions.\n\nIf you've offset your carbon emissions when you fly, chances are it's been with HIR carbon credits.\n\n'Alarm bells for everyone within government': former watchdog\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfessor Andrew Macintosh is scathing of the scheme. For six years, he was the chair of the watchdog that monitors carbon projects: the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee (ERAC).\n\nHe now works with a team at ANU and UNSW that has analysed how HIR projects are performing overall in Australia.\n\n\"The vast majority are performing badly. By that, I mean over 80 per cent\u00a0of projects, their tree cover has either gone nowhere or it's gone backwards since the projects were first registered,\" he told 7.30.\n\n![A satellite image from 2014 next to one from 2023 showing how much tree growth there has been in that time.](https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0012be23d90ad548377135f5352e1cda?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1080&cropW=1620&xPos=150&yPos=0&width=862&height=575) Satellite images from 2014 compared to 2023.\u00a0(Supplied: Planet Labs PBC)\"Despite this, they've received almost 25 million Australian carbon credit units over the period we analysed.\"\n\nThe value of a carbon credit changes each day, but today one credit is worth about $36.\n\nProfessor Macintosh said\u00a0most HIR projects his team has analysed had\u00a0too many mature trees on site at the start of the project.\n\nHe said\u00a0that's a problem because it skews the model that calculates how much carbon is being stored over the life of the project.\n\n\"The colloquial term for what's going on here is they're getting money for old rope. They're getting paid to grow trees that are already there,\" he told 7.30.\n\nIndustry frustrated by allegations\n----------------------------------\n\nA 7.30 crew travelled deep into red-dirt Australia, literally out the back of Bourke, to the epicentre of HIR farming to investigate how the system works.\n\nSkye Glenday, the co-CEO of Climate Friendly, shows us around a property she said is a great example of how HIR projects work.\n\nClimate Friendly is a carbon services provider that helps landowners farm carbon. They support around 160 HIR projects, covering about 10 million hectares of land.\n\n\"[It's]\u00a0really about improving degraded lands and we do this by changing the way that the land has been managed,\" she said.\n\n\"Typically [it's]\u00a0been over-grazed and cleared for quite a long time and the point of the project is to stop that overgrazing and clearing so that immature trees can regenerate the forest cover.\"\n\n![red dirt with trees to each

been over-grazed. and cleared for too long.\u00a0(ABC News: Ashlynne McGhee)She was frustrated by Professor Macintosh's criticisms.\n\n\"The only technology available to tackle climate change is to store carbon in the trees and soil \u2026 [Professor Macintosh's comments], in our view, really risks undermining investment in the sector, and delivering those urgent results,\" she said.\n\n\"This isn't an either-or question \u2014 we need to get on with actually drawing down carbon from the atmosphere.\"\n\nClean Energy Regulator defends scheme, but presses pause\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Clean Energy Regulator is responsible for green-lighting new carbon projects and handing out credits.\n\nIn March this year, it paused crediting on HIR carbon projects while it reviewed the documentation on every project and brought in changes recommended by a recent review.\n\nIt's now resumed issuing credits, telling 7.30 there is no evidence of over-crediting.\n\nThe regulator declined to be interviewed but said in a statement it disputes the findings of Professor Macintosh's team.\n\nIt said all projects are audited and its position is supported by scientific literature, including studies done by leading ecologist Dr David Eldridge.\n\nCER 'used my research inappropriately': academic\n------------------------------------------------\n\nDr Eldridge told 7.30 his work\u00a0over four decades had been misinterpreted by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER).\n\n\"When I found out that the Clean Energy regulator had used my research inappropriately, I was quite concerned,\" he said.\n\n![A man stands next to a

the\u00a0Clean Energy Regulator misinterpreted his work.(ABC News: Shaun Kingma)A central part of many HIR projects is the removal of grazing to encourage trees to start regenerating, but Dr Eldridge said\u00a0the effect of grazing on forest regeneration is completely overshadowed by rainfall and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\n\"I'm really concerned for those pastoralists graziers,

In our imperfect world, one party has vowed to do more on climate. The other party has vowed to do \u2026 the opposite of that.\n\n A year ago this week, President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats in Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest U.S. climate bill in history. But it was far from perfect. It left the U.S. with no realistic path toward meeting its stated goal of zeroing carbon emissions by 2050. At the rate we\u2019re still pumping planet-heating carbon into the atmosphere, today\u2019s heat waves could come to seem downright pleasant.\n\n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., vowed recently to enact more climate legislation should Democrats gain filibuster-proof control of lawmaking in the 2024 election. Republicans, meanwhile, have detailed plans to dismantle the IRA and Biden\u2019s other climate actions if they retake the White House and Senate.\n\n Building things is hard. Wrecking them is easy. The GOP needs no help in demolishing climate progress. So, assuming a 2025 in which America is run by politicians who are serious about the climate, here are some helpful ideas for an IRA II that may not be perfection, but at least strive in that direction.\n\n **Make carbon expensive**\n\n The IRA\u2019s tax breaks for clean energy will help curb emissions, but they aren\u2019t nearly enough to meet net-zero goals. A follow-up IRA should push companies to cut emissions faster, either by making them pay a price in a carbon market, or by establishing a federal clean-energy standard that penalizes energy producers for transitioning too slowly from fossil fuels. The Biden administration has floated both ideas, only to have them shot down by political opposition (including from Democrats).\n\n That leaves the U.S. and Australia as the world\u2019s only two developed countries that don\u2019t charge a price for spewing carbon into the atmosphere. And Australia this year took a step in the right direction, forcing industries responsible for about a quarter of the country\u2019s carbon pollution to cut emissions or buy credits. As history\u2019s biggest emitter, the U.S. has no good excuse for trailing its peers so badly on carbon pricing.\n\n \u201cOne of the real limitations with the IRA was that it contained carrots for renewables, but no real stick for fossil fuels,\u201d climate scientist Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania said in an email. \u201cI would like to see provisions that not only incentivize clean energy but dis-incentivize fossil fuel energy.\u201d\n\n That should also include killing a self-defeating IRA rule that the government cannot issue new offshore-wind leases without also issuing new offshore oil and gas leases. The important thing is to make sure there are enough financial incentives and goals in place that the whole economy is cutting carbon as quickly as possible.\n\n **Permissions, please**\n\n Clean energy is cheap and getting cheaper. It costs less to install and run new solar and wind power equipment than it does to start up new fossil-fuel plants. Investment in clean power has surged to nearly equal that of its dirtier counterpart. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that getting government permission to build clean-energy facilities and connect them to the power grid is needlessly difficult.\n\n Endless environmental reviews and lawsuits are strangling clean energy projects. More than 1250 gigawatts of clean power and 680 gigawatts of storage projects are stuck waiting for the go-ahead to connect to power lines, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Wait times have ballooned to nearly four years. A second IRA would include the permitting reform necessary to get these projects built and providing juice much more quickly.\n\n A new climate bill could also push to build clean-energy projects on unloved lands such as brownfields or abandoned mining sites, suggests Laura Brannen, senior policy adviser and federal climate policy lead at the Nature Conservancy.\n\n While we\u2019re building new energy and transmission lines, we\u2019ll also need funding to ramp up charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, including long-haul trucks. Might as well dedicate some funds to bolstering public transportation while we\u2019re at it.\n\n **Adaptation and resilience**\n\n While we should do everything we can to slow warming and avoid even worse consequences, it\u2019s also long past time to climate-proof our homes, offices and infrastructure against both current and future catastrophes.\n\n A meaningful IRA II would provide funding and government stewardship for adaptation and resilience, especially in vulnerable communities most at risk from global heating. It would also establish and enforce sustainable and resilient building standards across the country. A strong bill would also address land use, including climate-smart farming policies and incentives to plant more trees.\n\n Climate-related disasters inflicted $177\u00a0billion in damages last year, numbers that are becoming routine. Spending $1 on adaptation could avoid $6 in future costs, suggested Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. That\u2019s why spending on resilience isn\u2019t really a cost at all. It\u2019s an investment.\n\n **Let\u2019s be fair**\n\n Just as marginalized communities are on the front lines of climate change at home, developing countries bear the brunt of it around the world.\n\n Not only does the U.S. have a moral obligation to help these countries avoid and recover from climate disaster, it also has something to gain from helping them transition to cleaner energy. Developing nations that burn fossil fuels to raise living standards will only make the climate problem worse. The U.S. should play a central role in securing them green financing.\n\n At home, the Biden administration also must make good on its pledge to direct 40% of climate-related investments to disadvantaged communities. These include not just clean energy but reliable water supplies and transit, sustainable housing, job training, pollution cleanup and more.\n\n This all sounds like a big ask, and it is \u2014 maybe too big, given the current political climate. But with every year that passes without such action, the costs of addressing our delay will only grow bigger.\n\n *Mark Gongloff is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion.*\n\n  ", "summaries": [{"summary": "Democrats in Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest U.S. climate bill in history.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The passage of the bill is seen as a positive step towards addressing climate change."}, {"summary": "Suggestions for a follow-up to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) include making carbon expensive to incentivize clean energy and penalize fossil fuels, streamlining the permitting process for clean-energy projects, investing in adaptation and resilience measures, and providing support for developing countries to transition to cleaner energy.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The suggestions offer potential solutions but do not express a clear positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "The U.S. has a moral obligation to help developing countries avoid and recover from climate disaster and transition to cleaner energy.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Assisting developing countries and promoting cleaner energy can contribute to addressing the global climate problem."}], "semantic_commentary": "Article: Supports our intent by promoting clean energy and reducing carbon emissions.", "sentiment_score": 0.6666666666666666, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions incentivizing clean energy and penalizing fossil fuels, investing in adaptation and resilience measures, and supporting transition to cleaner energy."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions climate bill, clean energy, fossil fuels, and cleaner energy."}]}, {"source": "Washington Post", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/17/how-biodiversity-hopes-to-match-climate-s-investing-quicktake/81486ad8-3d16-11ee-aefd-40c039a855ba_story.html", "title": "How Biodiversity Hopes to Match Climate\u2019s Investing - The Washington Post", "content": "ShareComment on this storyComment0More than a million species face potential demise in what might be the biggest extinction event since an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs.

One obvious model is the financial infrastructure that\u2019s developed around the related goal of combating climate change, which has drawn in billions of dollars in investments. Doing the same for biodiversity faces steeper obstacles. Carbon dioxide can be measured, priced and traded. But how do you value a swamp or a newly discovered frog that pollinates flowers?

Wherever robust populations of many forms of life swarm in and around each other \u2014 think tropical rainforests and coral reefs \u2014 they reinforce the ecosystem\u2019s stability. By contrast, an area dominated by a narrower group becomes more vulnerable to sudden change if environmental conditions change. That\u2019s one reason biodiversity and climate change are seen by scientists as intertwined crises. When tropical rain forests are burnt to expand farmland, species-rich habitats are destroyed and carbon dioxide released; in the years that follow, more frequent and intense wildfires tear through the degraded forests, destroying habitats further and releasing even more CO2.\n\nAdvertisementStory continues below advertisement2. How is it in danger?\n\nAs the number of humans roughly doubled between 1970 and 2022, our growing demand for food, fuel and cleared land reduced the combined populations of other vertebrate species by 69%, according to the Living Planet Index, a project of the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London. The projection that a million species might die off, some within decades, was made by a United Nations scientific panel estimating that 10% of insect species and 25% of other plants and animals are in danger. Such a vast erosion of biodiversity poses a threat to the natural processes on which much of society is based. The World Bank has estimated that damage to the so-called natural services supported by biodiversity, like pollination of crops, water filtration and maintenance of fishing stocks, could reduce economic activity in 2030 by as much as $2.7 trillion a year, an amount close to the gross domestic product of France.\n\n3. What\u2019s being done?\n\nAdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAt a 2022 UN conference in Montreal, more than 190 countries and the European Union reached a sweeping agreement including what was called the 30x30 pledge: that by 2030 they would put in place programs to protect 30% of the world\u2019s land and oceans (up from 17% and 10% considered already protected, respectively) and repair 30% of degraded habitats. The final agreement, which, like the Paris Agreement on climate, isn\u2019t legally binding, calls for reducing subsidies for agriculture, fishing and fossil-fuel use that encourage large-scale destruction of habitats. The US did not sign the agreement, because it never ratified the UN treaty that was the basis of the talks, but President [Joe Biden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/joe-biden-2024/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12) issued an executive order setting a similar set of goals. Wealthier nations also agreed that by 2030 they would raise at least $30 billion a year for a new biodiversity fund, while working to boost overall investment and spending from public and private sources to at least $200 billion a year.\n\n4. How have investors reacted?\n\nBiodiversity has become a hot topic in global finance, with asset managers trying to replicate what has been built up in climate investing over the past 15 years. At the Montreal conference, over 150 financial institutions with more than $24 trillion in assets backed a plan to require companies to report on their \u201crisks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity.\u201d Another group of investors with a combined $3 trillion in funds launched a campaign to put pressure on 100 companies with a significant impact on habitats.\n\nAdvertisementStory continues below advertisement5. What\u2019s the appeal of biodiversity investing?\n\nClimate-related investing, and the broader movement known as ESG (environmental, social and governance related investing), has become a huge and profitable business for fund managers, with total assets of more than $2.7 trillion. While there is much debate over the actual impact of ESG investing, companies that are seen as better positioned for the shift to a greener economy are attractive to many investors.\n\n6.

Because only some of the proceeds are allocated to those projects, some deals, like a $364 million swap in Belize financed by \u201cblue\u201d bonds, have drawn the ire of analysts who consider the label misleading. Meanwhile some investors walked away from a $500 million swap in Gabon \u2014 the first in Africa \u2014 as it failed to generate any real debt savings for the country. Barbados and Ecuador are other countries to have secured such deals.\n\n\u2022 Biodiversity credits, also known as biocredits or nature credits representing a unit of biodiversity improvement or protection. They\u2019re designed to be tradable much as carbon credits are, but bought by companies to offset damage they\u2019ve caused or as a positive contribution to nature projects.

California Resources Corporation \u2013 one of the state\u2019s largest oil producers \u2013 is developing the facility with several partners.\n\nThe hub would be the first of its kind in California and, if successful, could serve as a model for similar efforts statewide.\n\n\u201cIt puts Kern County at the front of California, and California\u2019s been at the front of the world,\u201d said Ken Haney, a carbon manager for California Resources Corporation.\n\nTwo other Kern County projects spearheaded by large oil companies \u2013 Aera Energy and Chevron \u2013 also received about $5 million in federal funding.\n\n**What is carbon capture?**\n\nTraditional carbon capture projects work by sucking CO2 away at the source, typically an industrial smokestack or power plant. The gas is then stored deep underground, where it can no longer warm the planet.\n\nDirect-air capture, on the other hand, filters carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere after it has already been emitted.\n\nThe concept aims to reverse greenhouse gas emissions and meet ambitious climate goals.\n\nBut experts say there are problems with the nascent technology. Right now, capturing meaningful amounts of carbon dioxide directly from the air [requires large amounts of energy](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage/direct-air-capture) with no clear path to profit. That\u2019s because there\u2019s much less CO2 concentrated in the atmosphere than in the gas spewing out of a steel or cement plant, for example.\n\n\"If you'd asked me a year ago, I would've said we're 10 or 15 years away from it [direct air capture] being efficient and economic,\" Haney said.\n\nOfficials are hopeful that the new funding will accelerate research and lead to direct-air capture technology that is more efficient, sparking private investment.\n\nIn order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the Department of Energy estimates that up to 1.8 billion tons of CO2 will need to be captured and stored annually. California\u2019s own climate roadmap calls for capturing 100 million tons of carbon annually by 2045.\n\n\u201cCutting back on our carbon emissions alone won\u2019t reverse the growing impacts of climate change; we also need to remove the CO2 that we\u2019ve already put in the atmosphere \u2013 which nearly every climate model makes clear is essential to achieving a net-zero global economy by 2050,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said in a statement announcing the funding.\n\n**Kern\u2019s clean energy transition**\n\nThe California Direct Air Capture Hub is supported by a coalition of more than 40 organizations, including the Kern Community College District, which is banking on the technology to promote jobs and economic prosperity in the region.\n\n\u201cAs we embrace the technology that will create the jobs of the future, it is incumbent to ensure that the wealth created in the process benefits the people and communities where the projects are located,\u201d said the district\u2019s deputy chancellor Zav Dadabhoy.\n\nThe Department of Energy grants in Kern County are meager compared to the $1.2 billion awarded to larger direct air capture hubs in Texas and Louisiana. Project managers, however, remain hopeful that the Kern hub will be shovel-ready by 2025.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Department of Energy has awarded nearly $20 million to carbon capture projects in Kern County, California, to develop the region into a hub for the industry.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The funding will accelerate research and lead to more efficient direct-air capture technology, sparking private investment."}, {"summary": "The funding includes $12 million for designing the California Direct Air Capture Hub, which could serve as a model for similar projects statewide.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The hub puts Kern County at the forefront of the industry, potentially benefiting the region's economy and creating jobs."}, {"summary": "Two other projects spearheaded by Aera Energy and Chevron also received federal funding amounting to $5 million.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The funding supports additional carbon capture projects in Kern County, further boosting the development of the industry."}, {"summary": "Direct-air capture aims to filter carbon dioxide from the atmosphere after it has been emitted, helping to reverse greenhouse gas emissions and meet climate goals.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The technology has potential benefits but currently faces challenges with energy requirements and profitability."}, {"summary": "In order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, up to 1.8 billion tons of CO2 will need to be captured and stored annually, according to the Department of Energy.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The funding addresses the need to capture and store substantial amounts of CO2 to combat climate change."}, {"summary": "The California Direct Air Capture Hub is supported by a coalition of over 40 organizations, including the Kern Community College District, which sees the technology as a source of jobs and economic prosperity.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The project has significant support and potential economic benefits for the region."}, {"summary": "The Department of Energy grants for carbon capture projects in Kern County are smaller compared to those awarded in Texas and Louisiana, but project managers are optimistic about the Kern hub.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Despite smaller funding, there is optimism about the readiness of the Kern hub by 2025."}], "semantic_commentary": "Funding supports carbon capture hub in Kern County ($20M).", "sentiment_score": 0.8571428571428571, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions carbon capture projects, which are systems aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere."}]}, {"source": "Forces.net", "link": "https://www.forces.net/news/ministry-defences-crucial-role-uks-net-zero-ambition", "title": "Ministry of Defence plays a crucial role in UK's net zero ambition, report says", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://cf-images.eu-west-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/2685123856001/49c81350-9440-4f36-85b8-33456a4819f0/5224df03-fa66-4ee3-9334-b5d639c61549/1280x960/match/image.jpg)Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardMuteCurrent Time\u00a00:00/Duration\u00a00:00Loaded: 0%Stream Type\u00a0LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time\u00a0-0:00\u00a0Share1xPlayback RateChapters* Chapters\nDescriptions* descriptions off, selected\nCaptions* captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n* captions off, selected\nAudio TrackPicture-in-PictureQuality LevelsFullscreenThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

The defence estate aims to be net zero by 2030, so improvements to housing could include updated and more efficient heating systems in the near future.\n\nUK defence aspires to be a global leader in addressing climate threats. However, the report highlights the need for consistent emissions measurement and reporting, recommending an annual review.\n\nAmid these changes, maintaining military effectiveness remains paramount. The report underscores that climate actions must be balanced with the capability to respond to security challenges.\n\nTo co-ordinate these efforts, the report suggests appointing a dedicated climate change director within the MOD.\u00a0 This individual would work across defence to ensure swift action.\n\nThe report also advocates adopting ideas from academia and industry to speed up the development of new equipment.\n\nThe MOD's Climate Change and Sustainability Strategic Approach outlines its ambitions and methods to tackle climate change while preserving military capabilities.\n\nAn MOD spokesperson acknowledged the report's recommendations, noting its alignment with ongoing defence initiatives.\n\nIn conclusion, the MOD's role in achieving the UK's net zero target by 2050 is pivotal. As climate risks escalate, the MOD's ability to adapt swiftly while maintaining security capabilities will be central to a sustainable and secure future.\n\nIn response to the Defence Climate Change Report, the MOD spokesperson said: \"We will consider the report's recommendations, several of which align with work already being\u00a0undertaken\u00a0across defence, and we will respond in due course.\"\n\n\n\n### Related topics\n\n* [News](/news-0)\n\n\n\n### Join Our Newsletter\n\n\n\n![](/themes/custom/forcesnet_retheme/assets/dist/images/join-newsletter.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\n\nDaily briefing\n\n\n\nWeekly catch up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can confirm I have read and understood BFBS's [Privacy Policy](https://about.bfbs.com/privacy-policy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **WatchUs**On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Royal Tank Regiment instructors on reality of training Ukrainian soldiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Ukraine releases dranatic footage of sea drone strike on Crimean Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### After fighting the Taliban, should we now talk to them? | Sitrep podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Most Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![HMS Victorious in the Clyde area of Scotland as she returned from DASO 95, 10 October 1995 CREDIT Crown Copyright](/sites/default/files/styles/tertiary_teaser/public/hms-victorious-in-the-clyde-area-of-scotland-as-she-returned-from-daso-95-10-october-1995-credit-crown-copyright.jpg?itok=t4JxvS-Y)](/services/navy/why-are-submarines-black-answer-isnt-straightforward-you-might-think)\n\n\n\n#### \n[Why submarines are black: The answer isn't as straightforward as you might think](/services/navy/why-are-submarines-black-answer-isnt-straightforward-you-might-think)\n\n \n\n\n\n15th August 2023\n\n\n\n |\n \n[Navy](/services/navy)\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Red Arrows display at the 2022 Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) following 2 year break](/sites/default/files/styles/tertiary_teaser/public/Red%20Arrows%20display%20at%20the%202022%20Royal%20International%20Air%20Tattoo%20%28RIAT%29%20following%202%20year%20break%2015072022%20CREDIT%20MOD%20Crown%20Copyright.jpg?itok=mgGlGnid)](/red-arrows/red-arrows-cancel-another-show-technical-issues-blamed-again)\n\n\n\n#### \n[Red Arrows cancel second show as technical issues blamed again](/red-arrows/red-arrows-cancel-another-show-technical-issues-blamed-again)\n\n \n\n\n\n17th August 2023\n\n\n\n |\n \n[Red Arrows](/red-arrows)\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Red Arrows Display Royal International Air Tattoo 2023 RIAT RAF Fairford Gloucestershire](/sites/default/files/styles/tertiary_teaser/public/Red%20Arrows%20Display%20Royal%20International%20Air%20Tattoo%202023%20RIAT%20RAF%20Fairford%20Gloucestershire%20Image%20ID%202RCMP1B%20150723%20CREDIT%20Mark%20Dunn%2C%20Alamy%20Live%20News.jpg?itok=OP-R1DMk)](/red-arrows/red-arrows-back-performing-following-double-cancellation)\n\n\n\n#### \n[Red Arrows returning to the skies following double cancellation](/red-arrows/red-arrows-back-performing-following-double-cancellation)\n\n \n\n\n\n17 hours ago\n\n\n\n |\n \n[Red Arrows](/red-arrows)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Top Videos\n\n\n\nNow playing![](https://cf-images.eu-west-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/2685123856001/8641a782-c657-494a-9cf0-6b402bbe80b5/1a27416f-4fc6-481f-a66e-7ff099f36ae3/1280x960/match/image.jpg)Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardMuteCurrent Time\u00a00:00/Duration\u00a00:00Loaded: 0%Stream Type\u00a0LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time\u00a0-0:00\u00a0Share1xPlayback RateChapters* Chapters\nDescriptions* descriptions off, selected\nCaptions* captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n* captions off, selected\nAudio TrackPicture-in-PictureQuality LevelsFullscreenThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

A series of ambitious pledges followed, and many actors invested seriously in climate change. But we\u2019re still far away from achieving those targets.\nA high-level expert group report on the Net-zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities revealed that in many of these pledges are not aligned with science and do not have enough details to be credible.\n\n\n\u201c90% of the world is covered by net zero targets, either at the national level, or with businesses or cities and regions. So that\u2019s the good news. The bad news is, it understates the challenge that we have in front of us,\u201d says Catherine McKenna, Chair, High\u2011level Expert Group on the Net Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities.\n\n\n\u201cWe are nowhere near where we need to be yet. And some targets are even misleading consumers, investors, and the public.\u201d\n\n\n**Zero in on the data**\n\n\nThe report lays out 10 criteria for evaluating whether private sector net zero pledges are credible. It recommends that pledges have, medium, and long-term absolute emissions reduction targets.\n\n\n\u201cMeasure, measure, measure! When we talk about climate change, the good thing is that you can measure it. You need to have science-based targets based on 1.5 degrees of warming, have a transition plan, and say how are you going to reduce your emissions. You need to show how you\u2019re spending your money and increasing it in going clean and disclose transparently,\u201d elaborates McKenna.\n\n\nNet zero transition plans, the expert committee says, should be comprehensive, actionable, and consistent with IPCC or IEA net zero greenhouse gas emissions modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. They should also have limited or no overshoot with global net zero targets, and align governance and incentive structures, capital expenditures, research and development, skills and human resource development, and public advocacy. The committee also recommends that net zero plans should be updated every five years and progress reporting should be done on an annual basis.  \n\nOf fossil fuels, carbon credits and lobbies\n\n\nThere are also some actions that should not be part of a credible net zero pledge, McKenna explains. \u201cYou cannot invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure and reduce your emissions by buying cheap credits, which often lack integrity and have unintended consequences. You cannot lobby governments against good climate policy, including policy that you would need to meet your own targets\u201d.\n\n\nThe UN report recommends that all net zero pledges include specific targets aimed at ending the use of and/or support for fossil fuels in line with IPCC and IEA pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. It also states that companies must prioritise urgent and deep reduction of emissions across their value chain, using high integrity carbon credits in voluntary markets for beyond value chain mitigation. Finally, companies should disclose their trade associations and align their engagement and external policy and lobby for positive climate action and not lobby against it.\n\n\n**When in doubt, disclose**\n\n\nWith more responsibility comes more disclosure. The report advocates that companies annually disclose their greenhouse gas data and other relevant information against their baseline along with comparable data to enable effective tracking of progress toward their net-zero targets. It emphasises that reported emissions reductions and progress on net zero be verified by independent third parties.\n\n\nThe report also highlights the need for multinational corporations and financial institutions to participate in initiatives such as Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) that aim to bridge the gap between developed and developing nations by provide access to renewable, clean energy.\n\n\nWhile South Africa was the first beneficiary of the JETP financing mechanism, Vietnam, India, and Indonesia have since followed suit with the donor pool including several developed countries, multilateral development banks, national development banks, and development finance agencies.\n\n\nLast but not the least, the report suggests standardising and sprucing up the regulatory framework by setting up a task force of international regulators.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just advertise that you\u2019re amazing. You have to do the hard work, which isn\u2019t glamorous. It\u2019s very hard to reduce emissions and transform an entire business. It is required of everyone \u2013 government, businesses, and individuals as well. But a huge responsibility goes to the corporate world, especially the large emitters because they are responsible for a huge percentage of emissions. They need to disclose transparently so they can be held accountable,\u201d concludes McKenna.  \n\nSource: W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "A high-level expert group report on the

the drinks industry continues to set and work towards climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, there are questions about whether they will reach their goals.\n\n\nGlobalData\u2019s analytics show climate change credentials are a key area of concern for beverage companies, with mentions in company filings having increased fourfold since 2016.\n\n\n

[View all](https://www.globaldata.com/store/industry/consumer-market/)\nHowever, [new research by Kearney](https://www.just-drinks.com/news/beverage-companies-on-track-to-miss-emission-reduction-targets-study-predicts/) has shown that, based on their current trajectory of 0.7% reduction in CO2e emissions per year, drinks companies will miss their 2030 and 2050 targets. In order to regain lost ground, beverage companies will need to improve their reduction rate 11-fold.\n\n\nThe potential fallout of this chasm between public (and some would say optimistic) ESG statements and actual CO2 emissions reduction could be wide-ranging. As well as the environmental cost, Kearney\u2019s research cited \u201ccratering stock prices\u201d, \u201ca loss of credibility\u201d and the introduction of \u201cdraconian regulation\u201d.\n\n\nAmong the companies talking about climate change in recent company filings were Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), which celebrated reaching its goal of using 100% recycled or renewable plastic in Europe and Australia, the Pacific and Indonesia in its quarterly earnings call in August. Kearney\u2019s analysis held up CCEP\u2019s supply chain finance programme as an example of how beverage companies can incentivise suppliers throughout the value chain to improve their ESG performance. \u00a0\n\n\nIndia-based Tata Global Beverages also touted its lower carbon footprint in its quarterly earnings call in July, achieved through upgrades to its facility and a more sustainable product offering with recyclable boxes, no plastic outers, and plant-based tea bags.\n\n\nAnd earlier this month, Heineken reported a reduction in its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions \u2013 a step closer, they say, to its \u201cambition to reach net zero carbon emissions in production sites by 2030\u201d.\n\n\nHowever, despite widespread reporting of Scope 1 and Scope 2 reductions in the food and beverage industry, disclosures of Scope 3 emissions are [often patchy](https://www.just-food.com/features/the-worlds-largest-food-companies-have-gone-backwards-on-net-zero/).\n\n\n[A 2022 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622018832) of the global top 50 food and beverage companies\u2019 emissions reports found that 88% of companies\u2019 total reported GHG emissions derive from Scope 3 emissions (or the wider value chain) \u2013 and yet reporting of Scope 3 emissions is \u201coften incomplete and inconsistent\u201d, neglecting (for example) land-use change emissions.\n\n\nMoreover, the study found that \u201cmore than a third of reported Scope 3 emissions were not covered by emissions reductions targets of the companies\u201d, meaning that between 53 and 77% of emissions go under-reported.\n\n\nKearney\u2019s recent analysis, however, takes a sympathetic view of drinks companies\u2019 net zero efforts: \u201cKearney sees the lack of progress to date as a reflection not of any ill will or industry reticence to change, but rather as a result of this being a tough problem to resolve.\u201d\n\n\n**Our signals coverage is powered by* [*GlobalData\u2019s Thematic Engine*](https://www.globaldata.com/thematic-research/)*, which tags millions of data items across six alternative datasets \u2014 patents, jobs, deals, company filings, social media mentions and news \u2014 to themes, sectors and companies.

And while the job cuts and cost reductions he\u2019s announced in the months since haven\u2019t surprised many people, the news that Canada's largest emitter was going to abandon any pretense of caring about climate change probably did. \u201cOur current strategic framework is insufficient in terms of what it takes to win,\u201d Kruger, also a former ExxonMobil executive, told investors and analysts on the company\u2019s most recent quarterly conference call. \u201cWhile important, we have a bit of a disproportionate emphasis on the longer-term energy transition.\u201d\n\nThis is a company, after all, that brought former Liberal leadership contender Martha Hall Findlay in to [serve as its chief sustainability officer](https://globalnews.ca/news/9212862/martha-hall-findlay-suncor-retiring-climate/) in 2020, and then promoted her to the role of \u201cchief climate officer\u201d in February 2022. That was the first such appointment by any Canadian oil and gas company, and while she left Suncor later that year due to health and personal challenges, she remained optimistic about her former employer\u2019s commitment to the cause. But [Arlene Strom](https://pathwaysalliance.ca/arlene-stroms-passion-for-the-energy-transition-drives-her-work/), who took over for Hall Findlay as chief sustainability officer, retires at the end of this year, and the company has decided to eliminate the role completely. \n\nIt\u2019s not like Suncor was making any great strides in the direction of climate leadership under Kruger\u2019s predecessors, mind you. It was, after all, still an oilsands company intent on increasing production and associated greenhouse gas emissions. It sold off its wind and solar assets last year, ostensibly to focus on \u201csustainable jet fuel\u201d and carbon capture and storage projects. And for all of its talk about net-zero targets and lowering carbon emissions, it hadn\u2019t actually done much walking in that direction. Maybe Kruger\u2019s honesty here helps remind us what these companies are really all (and always were) about: making money. \n\n#### Get daily news from Canada's National Observer\n\n Email \\* Suncor\u2019s not the only climate-curious oil company backing away from previous commitments. In the face of rising oil prices, BP [scaled back](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/change-bp-climate-goal-concern-emissions-focused-investors-shareholder-2023-02-10/) its promised 40 per cent production cut by 2030 to a more modest 25 per cent. Shell, which had committed to reducing its oil production 20 per cent by 2030, decided to achieve that by selling it to another oil company \u2014 which will, of course, keep producing oil.\n\nYes, both companies remain ostensibly committed to their 2050 net-zero targets, but given the ease with which they\u2019ve abandoned more imminent ones, it\u2019s not clear why anyone should take them seriously. As Dan Cohn, a global energy transition researcher at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis [told](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/16/big-oil-climate-pledges-extreme-heat-fossil-fuel) The Guardian, \u201cthey have left no doubt that their pledges were deployed for cynical political purposes, only to be ditched when they no longer suited the industry\u2019s strategic position.\u201d\n\n Businesses are free to do what they want, of course, subject to the rules and regulations governments impose on them. But this flip-flop on climate commitments should remind everyone that voluntary pledges and promises are no substitute for legally binding responsibilities, especially when they can be discarded with the stroke of a pen \u2014 or in anticipation of a different government, with different priorities, coming to power. Canada\u2019s oil and gas industry may well be betting that Pierre Poilievre\u2019s Conservatives will win the next election, and that the Tories would happily release them from any responsibilities to future generations or the climate. The current federal government, which has already offered up companies like Suncor billions of dollars in subsidies for decarbonization (and is still [being pressed by them](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/these-oilsands-companies-raked-in-35b-last-year-now-they-re-asking-for-public-money/article_9d109706-928b-520e-847f-fa3cc8829e12.html) for tens of billions more), would do well to remember that. \n\nKruger, for his part, seems very taken with the notion of \u201cwinning.\u201d It\u2019s a word that popped up repeatedly in his comments on Suncor\u2019s recent conference call, and it\u2019s one he\u2019s used in previous interviews to explain his approach. \"I consider myself to be reasonably decisive, and very competitive,\" he [told](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/suncor-ceo-rich-kruger-1.6837350) the Canadian Press\u2019s Amanda Stephenson when he first took on the job in May. \"I play to win.\"\n\n ### What people are reading\n\n         [![](https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/styles/nat_teaser/public/img/2023/08/17/f3sxz3twwaajboa.jpeg?itok=xN8qsHDh \"Pierre Poilievre's summer image makeover hasn't changed two important things: his antipathy towards the media and willingness to trade in the language of online conspiracies.

After all, if it wasn\u2019t clear before, it should be by now: the senior executives at oil and gas companies like Suncor are deliberately ragging the puck in order to delay making meaningful investments in the future and are not willing to constrain their ability to shower shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. The Rich Krugers of the world want to drive up their share price, see their stock options pay out and maximize the amount of cash they can put in their bank account. \n\nYes, they\u2019ll continue to pay lip service to the idea of 2050 targets, but that\u2019s because they know they won\u2019t be the ones who have to do the heavy lifting to reach them. By then, they\u2019ll be comfortably retired in some other part of the country or the world \u2014 that is, if they\u2019re even still alive. The failure to invest in real climate solutions back in 2023 (like, say, Occidental Petroleum\u2019s recent US$1.1 billion [purchase of Carbon Engineering](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-occidental-petroleum-carbon-engineering-acquisition/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)) and the costs that will be imposed on people in the decades that followed, is someone else\u2019s problem. \n\n \n>  Suncor Energy is one of Canada's biggest oilsands companies and the single biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the country.

All other battery companies supplying EVs and grid storage facilities are far behind in their R&D and technological advancement and many will probably fold.\n\n\nCATL will also be releasing a sodium battery in future that is nearing completion in the lab. It will probably be a hybrid that does not use lithium, nickel or cobalt and promises excellent cold weather performance on top of all the other advantages listed above.\n\n\nIf Suncor et al cannot see the worldwide threat EVs and grid storage with superior batteries pose to their business model in the next few years, then they deserve to be made redundant once they can no longer make their blindfolded shareholders happy.\n\n\nIt's possible downtown Calgary will have a lot of empty office towers by the mid-30's.\n\n\n\n\n\n* [reply](/comment/reply/38469/74988)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n### [Waving a white flag of](/comment/74990#comment-74990)\n\n\n\nTris Pargeter | 22 hours ago \n\n\nWaving a white flag of surrender? Hardly. Suncor is defiantly waving the black flag of burn-the-house-down anarchy, and maybe adding the skull-and-crossbones of the pirate's \"I'll take everything I can for as long as I can get away with it\" amorality. No surprise, really. In luring Rich Kruger out of retirement (with millions, no doubt), making him even Richer Kruger, Suncor's Board of Directors chose an old guy from the last century whose no doubt lucrative career was with Imperial Oil, the Canadian subsidiary of Exxon, a leader over decades in climate denial propaganda and active lobbying against any measures that might reduce profitability by addressing climate change.  \n\nSuncor's Board is chaired by Michael Wilson, former Conservative Finance Minister. Shame on him and the rest of the Board. Suncor is a major Canadian company whose future survival will depend on effectively acting to reduce emissions. In dismissing the importance of climate action and eliminating the executive Sustainabilty position, after Suncor previously backed out of its ventures in clean solar and wind energy, Suncor is betraying the trust of Canadians and barrelling straight back to the twentieth century, all so Kruger can \"win\" and \"reward shareholders\". How incredibly short-sighted. Of course, Suncor can profitably milk the cow for a while, and Kruger will be long gone when it goes out of business in a decade or two, stranded on the oil-sandbar of history. Too bad - it could and should have been a leader.\n\n\n\n\n\n* [reply](/comment/reply/38469/74990)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n### [Oil companies operating in](/comment/74992#comment-74992)\n\n\n\nAlex Botta | 21 hours ago \n\n\nOil companies operating in Alberta during the 2014-20 world oil price downturn were weeping and begging for taxpayer largesse while also blaming environmentalists and Trudeau for a multitude of sins, chief among them of being solely responsible for controlling the world price of crude, or so went the implications. Conspiracies were spouted, tears were shed, fat corporate hands were extended to receive cash, shareholders were not happy and wanted to sell dividend losing company branches.\n\n\nWhat a difference an uptick in price and post-pandemic oil demand made. I wonder what outlandish conspiracies will abound when cheap renewables, affordable EVs and better grants for energy conservation and transitioning to electricity really start eroding demand for oil & gas?\n\n\nI doubt even a Poilievre government can stop the slide, though if elected (shudder!) it will surely try between moving the Bank of Canada onto bitcoin, hiring Q consultants to run the Ministry of Health and appointing Convoy alumni to write national transportation policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n* [reply](/comment/reply/38469/74992)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n### [Appreciate the hopeful stuff](/comment/74995#comment-74995)\n\n\n\nTris Pargeter | 19 hours ago \n\n\nAppreciate the hopeful stuff Alex, and \"shudder\" doesn't even come close.

CCS projects do nothing\u00a0to reduce downstream emissions. Furthermore, CCS is 'energy intensive, slow to implement, and unproven at scale, making it a poor strategy for decarbonizing oil and gas production, as evidenced by the track record of the technology in Canada and globally.' It is also very expensive. To date, the federal govt alone has committed more than $9 billion to it, and by 2030 Canadian support is estimated to be twice as high as the equivalent subsidy in the US. Finally, 'CCS is a risky investment for taxpayers and comes with a significant opportunity cost for near-term, more cost-effective solutions.'\u00a0 \n\n\nSo will Suncor's abandoning of CCS mean a cut in govt subsidies? If it does, I guess that might be some small consolation for the rest of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n* [reply](/comment/reply/38469/74993)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n### [I like to think that in](/comment/74996#comment-74996)\n\n\n\nTris Pargeter | 19 hours ago \n\n\nI like to think that in offering a 50% tax credit on CCS developments, the government is calling the industry's bluff. The oil companies claim CCS technology will eliminate emissions from production - they don't see why they should count emissions from burning the oil thus produced - so go for it, if you think that's the answer. The tax credits only accrue IF the companies actually invest in CCS, so they have to divert some of their profits to CCS development before they get anything.\n\n\nI think this is largely a stalling tactic, pretending they are addressing emission while demanding ever higher levels of subsidies to do so. My bet is that few CCS projects will actually get built. As you say, Sally, it costs a lot and doesn't work very well. Most of the tax credits the government has offered will likely never be claimed.\n\n\n\n\n\n* [reply](/comment/reply/38469/74996)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n### [Aha.

This commitment has a 2019 baseline.\n\n\nThe SBTi has verified that the target is in line with the 1.5C pathway of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\nSage Group\u2019s priority focus areas for addressing Scope 1 (direct) and 2 (power-related) emissions include improving energy efficiency and procuring renewable electricity for its workplaces. At present, it meets 45% of its global electricity consumption needs. It will plan ways of increasing this proportion, including for employees working remotely and in hybrid patterns.\n\n\nAdditionally, Sage is refreshing its approach to employee engagement on climate. It will soon launch a carbon literacy programme for staff.\n\n\nAs with many other large businesses, Sage sees a significant proportion of its emissions arising from Scope 3 (indirect) sources. It is therefore requesting that all suppliers measure and disclose \u201caccurate and verified\u201d data on their emissions to Sage via CDP. Suppliers without their own SBTi-approved targets are also being encouraged and supported to set them.\n\n\nSage\u2019s executive VP for sustainability and society, Elisa Moscolin, said: \u201cAs a FTSE 100 corporation, we have an important role to play in driving sustainable business practices, but our ambition goes beyond our four walls: we are just as focused on empowering small and medium businesses across the world to get to net-zero.\n\n\n\u201cWith the right plans and people in place, I\u2019m looking forward to making progress against our targets and sharing our successes and learnings to ignite sustainable change across our ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\nSome 3,200 companies have set targets verified by the SBTi and around 11% of them are in the technology sector.\n\n\nThe SBTi is [in the process of phasing out 2C-aligned targets in a bid to push corporates to be more ambitious and align with 1.5C.](https://www.edie.net/sbti-to-increase-minimum-target-setting-requirements-to-1-5c/) It has also [begun to \u2018name and shame\u2019 businesses that fail to follow through on commitments to have their emissions goals verified.](https://www.edie.net/business-giants-named-and-shamed-for-flouting-science-based-targets-pledges/#:~:text=The%20Science%2DBased%20Targets%20Initiative,this%20timeframe%20from%20its%20dashboard.)\n\n\n**Kier Group** \n\n\nIn related news, Kier Highways Ltd has had new emissions goals verified by the SBTi as 1.5C-aligned through to 2030 and aligned with the initiative\u2019s Net-Zero Standard in the longer term.\n\n\nThe Net-Zero Standard requires companies to reduce emissions across all scopes by at least 90% by 2050 at the latest.\n\n\nKier Highways has pledged to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by more than 97% by 2039. It will also reduce Scope 3 emissions by 90% by 2045. This will enable it to create a net-zero value chain by this point. It is hoping to bring the former targets forward if possible.\n\n\nIn the meantime, interim targets have been set to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030. To help deliver this, Kier Highways will transition to 100% renewable electricity, up from 0% in the 2018 baseline year.\n\n\nKier Group, the parent company of Kier Highways, is currently awaiting SBTi verificiation for group-wide emissions targets \u2013 both near-term and longer-term.\n\n\n\u201cReducing our emissions as quickly as possible in order to help limit the impact of climate change is a top priority for us,\u201d said Kier Transportation\u2019s head of environment and sustainability Matt Tompsett.\n\n\n\u201cWe are already seeing the impacts of climate change all around us in the form of extreme weather. This impacts our staff, our local communities and our ability to deliver our projects for our clients.\u201d\n\n\n***The SBTi\u2019s chief impact officer Maria Outters is a guest on edie\u2019s most recent Sustainability Uncovered podcast episode.

Every sector, from agriculture to health, feels the weight of its impact. Yet, Africa, contributing a mere 5% of global GHG emissions, stands at the frontline of vulnerability.\n \n\n\n MTN recognizes this challenge and is poised to lead the charge toward a brighter, sustainable future. The recent COP27, aptly named the \"African COP,\" spotlighted Africa's unique position-rich in opportunities yet fraught with challenges. We were not just participants; we were collaborators, inspired by the global commitment to support developing nations.\n \n\n\n The journey to a low-carbon economy is more than an environmental mandate; it's a call for equity, inclusivity, and a recognition of Africa's diverse landscape. Success means more than reduced emissions; it means broader access to modern amenities, enhanced telecommunications, and pathways to sustainable livelihoods.\n \n\n\n MTN's 2023 climate change report, aligned to Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), outlines our unwavering commitment to addressing climate change. Our Project Zero, with its ambitious goal of Net Zero emissions by 2040, is a testament to our dedication and belief in growth that harmonizes with, not against, our planet's well-being.\n \n\n\n Our actions echo our words. This year, we have taken bold steps, from submitting our climate goals to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to expanding our green energy footprint. We are not just aiming for growth; we are aiming for sustainable growth.\n \n\n\n We are investing in the future-electric vehicles, high-efficiency lighting, solar, wind, and battery storage into our operations. Believing that these types of investments can bring about a thriving green economy, fostering green industries, green enterprises, and green jobs for Africa by Africans.\n \n\n\n Our digital innovations are resilient by design, primed to counteract the capricious impacts of climate change. With the rollout of our advanced 5G and fibre networks, we will further increase energy efficiency in terms of energy consumption per traffic unit.\n \n\n\n But the journey is not without its hurdles. The rising demand for connectivity, for instance, brings with it the challenge of increased energy consumption. Yet, we are undeterred. Inspired by our belief that everyone deserves a modern, connected life, we are charting a course toward a sustainable future.\n \n\n\n Africa's moment is now. We are embracing the challenges, unlocking the opportunities, and driving toward a future where technology and sustainability converge. Our path is clear, and our commitment is unwavering. Together, we're building a sustainable, inclusive world for all.\n \n\nClick here to read our 2023 Climate change report.\n \n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "MTN recognizes the challenge of climate change and is committed to addressing it through initiatives like Project Zero, aiming for Net Zero emissions by 2040.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "MTN's commitment to addressing climate change demonstrates a proactive and positive approach towards sustainability."}, {"summary": "MTN is investing in green technologies like electric vehicles, high-efficiency lighting, solar, wind, and battery storage to foster a green economy in Africa.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "MTN's investment in green technologies reflects a positive initiative towards creating green industries and jobs in Africa."}, {"summary": "MTN's digital innovations, like 5G and fibre networks, aim to increase energy efficiency in the face of increasing demand for connectivity.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "MTN's focus on energy efficiency in their digital innovations shows a positive commitment to tackling the challenge of increased energy consumption."}], "semantic_commentary": "MTN supports green initiatives and aims to reduce emissions.", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions MTN committing to achieving net zero emissions by 2040."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions MTN investing in green technologies like electric vehicles, high-efficiency lighting, solar, wind, and battery storage to reduce carbon emissions."}]}, {"source": "ASI Central", "link": "https://www.asicentral.com/news/newsletters/promogram/august-2023/gildan-publishes-19th-esg-report/", "title": "Gildan Publishes 19th ESG Report", "content": "\n\n\n\n[Sustainability](/promofortheplanet \"Show all articles for Sustainability\")\nAugust 17, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGildan Publishes 19th ESG Report\n--------------------------------\n\n\nThe company highlighted its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, among other accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy [Theresa Hegel](/news/authors/Theresa-Hegel)\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Share This Article:**\n* **Copied**\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Top 40 supplier Gildan](https://www.asicentral.com/news/magazines/counselor/july-2023/top-40-suppliers-2023-no-5-gildan) (asi/56842) has been tracking and sharing its environmental, social and governance (ESG) progress for nearly two full decades. The Montreal-headquartered company just released its [19th ESG report](https://gildancorp.com/media/uploads/sustainability_reports/bgildans_2022_esg_report.pdf), highlighting its 2022 performance against key targets and the momentum generated across all global operations in the first year of activating its [Next Generation ESG plan](https://www.asicentral.com/news/newsletters/promogram/january-2022/gildan-launches-next-generation-esg-plan/).\n\n\n![eco sustainability](/media/33xdtidy/eco-sustainability-616.jpg)\n\n\n\u201cLooking back at 2022, I am pleased with our continued commitment to ESG across our operations and our enhanced processes and cross-functional collaboration and accountability,\u201d said Glenn J. Chamandy, president and CEO of Gildan. \u201cESG is one of the three core pillars of our Gildan Sustainable Growth business strategy, and as we continue our journey toward achieving our 2030 ESG targets, we are committed to delivering and reporting on our progress.\u201d\n\n\nAmong the 2022 highlights, Gildan tied 25% of all senior executives\u2019 strategic objectives to their annual short-term incentive plan to support the advancement of its ESG targets; [included sustainability-linked terms](https://www.asicentral.com/news/newsletters/promogram/march-2022/gildan-ties-loan-borrowing-costs-to-sustainability-goals/) in its existing $1 billion revolving credit facility; reduced absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 10.9%, compared to a 2018 base year; reduced water intensity by 18.4%, compared to a 2018 base year; and sourced 21.7% of its cotton supply from worldwide cotton certifier Better Cotton and verified U.S.-grown cotton suppliers through the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol. The company also achieved 30.3% gender parity in the collective group representing director-level and above employees, an improvement over 26.7% in 2021.\n\n\nPlus, 14.2% of total SKUs of packaging and trim materials specific to apparel (including carton, polyester, paper and cotton-poly trims) contain recycled materials or have relevant sustainability certifications, according to thefirm.\n\n\nGildan noted that it contributed $1.1 million to community initiatives in 2022. The apparel basics supplier wants to increase annual contributions to an amount equal to 1% of its pre-tax earnings by 2026, with a focus on three core areas: quality education, good health and well-being, and protection of natural resources.\n\n\nAmong its accomplishments in 2022, Gildan helped fund a partnership in Bangladesh with Room to Read, which helps girls in grades six through 12 develop education skills and knowledge to address common gender barriers. Since 2017, Gildan has donated over $200,000 to the program, helping nearly 500 girls. In Honduras, Gildan donated more than 3,000 T-shirts to support health awareness and fundraising events. Along with local employees, it raised more than $20,000 for Teleton, a rehabilitation center. Last year, Gildan also launched a three-year, $40,000 partnership with the Santo Domingo Water Fund (FASD) in the Dominican Republic to improve the supply of high-quality water for residents near company operations.\n\n\nIn addition, Gildan published its first stand-alone [Climate Change Disclosure Report](https://www.asicentral.com/news/newsletters/promogram/january-2023/gildan-publishes-first-stand-alone-climate-change-disclosure-report/) in 2022.\n\n\nGildan also shared some of its more recent 2023 achievements. The Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) validated the firm\u2019s near-term targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. SBTi also validated its plan to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 13.5% by 2030, from a 2019 base year. The company also obtained its first ISO 45001 safety certification at one of its sewing facilities in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\nThe company touted the recognition it received for its ESG practices, noting that it was included in the [Dow Jones Sustainability Index](https://www.asicentral.com/news/newsletters/promogram/december-2022/gildan-earns-accolades-for-sustainability-initiatives/) for the 10th consecutive year in 2022, and was named one of the \u201c[World\u2019s 100 Most Sustainable

\"Sustainability\")\n | [Body Care](/tag/body-care \"Body Care\")\n\nA study by Planet Tracker found some FMCG companies\u2019 emissions were seven times higher than the recommended level\n\n\n![The think tank urged investors to encourage companies to increase their ambitions on Scope 3 emissions](/article-image-alias/colgate-palmolive-and-p-g-lag-behind-unilever-2.jpeg)*The think tank urged investors to encourage companies to increase their ambitions on Scope 3 emissions*\n\nUnilever is outpacing its fast moving consumer goods competitors when it comes to meeting climate transition goals, according to a new report.\u00a0\nA study by non-profit financial think tank Planet Tracker, which analysed the company transition plans of Unilever, Procter & Gamble (P&G) and Colgate-Palmolive, found Colgate-Palmolive and P&G\u2019s expected emissions to 2030 to be seven times higher than the recommended level set by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\n\nThe SBTi promotes best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets for alignment with 1.5\u00baC by 2030.\n\n\nThe report indicated that Unilever, although on a path to surpass 1.5 times over the recommended SBTi level, nevertheless exhibited a more comprehensive mitigation strategy for Scope 3 emissions, especially upstream.\n\n\nThe think tank calculated the magnitude of the companies\u2019 emissions when downstream \u2018optional\u2019 Scope 3 emissions \u2013 for example, emissions derived from the use of other products and services together with the companies\u2019 brands \u2013 were included.\u00a0\n\n\nThe findings showed that emissions for Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive and P&G are up to three, five and eight times higher, respectively, when optional indirect emissions are accounted for.\u00a0\n\n\nPlanet Tracker said P&G\u2019s emissions, for example, are 26 MTCO2e (million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent).\n\n\nBut when downstream Scope 3 emissions are included, this figure increased to 200 MTCO2e \u2013 almost equivalent to the national emissions of France.\u00a0\n\n\nPlanet Tracker again singled out Unilever for praise for including in its targets the downstream Scope 3 emissions the company has control over, such as transportation and distribution.\u00a0\n\n\nThe think tank further estimated that the FMCG goods companies continuing with their current trends of emissions could cost Unilever 14% of its historic annual operating profit (US$1.5bn), Colgate-Palmolive 30% of profit ($1.1bn) and P&G 51% of profit ($6.7bn).\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOur comparison of leading consumer goods companies demonstrates a worrying trend of companies failing to effectively tackle direct Scope 3 emissions, especially upstream, which if not mitigated soon could cost billions of dollars in the future,\u201d said Ion Visinovschi, Research Analyst at Planet Tracker.\n\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, we look at the emissions disclosed by the company in the last three or five years, depending on comparable data availability,\u201d Visinovschi explained.\n\n\n\u201cThen, we calculate the annual change in these emissions for the selected period.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLastly, we assume that if the companies continue to do what they have done so far (in the last three to five years) the same average annual change will continue in the future up until 2030.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat is how we get the 2025 and 2030 emissions levels.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nVisinovschi\u00a0added: \u201cWhile Unilever is on track for a +2\u00baC pathway and thus still has some work to do, the comparison between companies allows us to see how far behind giants like Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble are from the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe urge investors to be wary of public initiatives claiming to tackle indirect emissions, which could be linked to substantial emission reductions, as such reductions could come from other actors such as the public grid renewable electrification.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cInstead, investors should encourage these companies to increase their ambitions on Scope 3 emissions they have a direct impact on such as their supply chain.\u201d\n\n\n### Inside FMCG giants' Scope 3 strategies\n\n\nIn response to the findings,\u00a0a\u00a0Unilever spokesperson told *Cosmetics Business*: \u201cBack in 2021, we were one of the first companies of our size to put a\u00a0[Climate Transition Action Plan](https://www.unilever.com/files/92ui5egz/production/56a097ca6baaa654e78dfa8a820257d9a9edabf0.pdf)\u00a0to a shareholder vote, which was approved with 99.59% of votes cast.\n\n\n\u201cIn this, we have set out how, and where, we intend to address emissions across our value chain, including Scope 3 emissions. \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cWe have opportunities to reduce emissions from our product portfolio through targeted interventions both up and downstream \u2013 for example, by encouraging suppliers to set their own science-based targets and working with logistics partners to shift to lower emission transport options.\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps even greater opportunities come from strategic integration into our brands.\n\n\n\u201cInnovation programmes can drive the redesign of our products in ways that reduce emissions.\n\n\n\u201cThis can be through concentrating or compacting products, or developing new lower emission ingredient substitutes.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0They added: \u201cBut with the lion\u2019s share of our value chain emissions falling outside of our direct control, societal change remains critical to achieving our targets and to achieving the Paris Agreement goals.\n\n\n\u201cInfluencing wider society is, therefore, an integral part of our plan but we cannot do this alone.\u201d\n\n\nThe company added that it was\u00a0focusing on the biggest sources of its emissions, and is being transparent about its progress and where it falls short.\u00a0\n\n\nThe spokesperson futher added: \u201cIn terms of improvement, progress from everyone, whether it be businesses or governments, needs to speed up.\u201d\n\n\nA P&G representative, meanwhile, told *Cosmetics Business*: \u201cP&G has set an ambition to be net zero by 2040 as shared in our\u00a0[Climate Transition Action Plan](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/s1.q4cdn.com/695946674/files/doc_downloads/esg/PG_CTAP.pdf__;!!NgSi4SaN6ydtRVQ-!x1DpFW7DoEbisfOpfd09mM_5Nv26S_vxlmOMHjb8zthE7QECJ9oUFRRnaVKE1yZx1M9Cg4x84V3nTn4KuDMpZo-AMP7VWno$ \"https://s1.q4cdn.com/695946674/files/doc_downloads/esg/pg_ctap.pdf\"), and we are continuing to make progress toward our 2030 Climate targets. \u00a0\n\n\n\u201cP&G changed our reporting scope during the timeframe Planet Tracker used for their model, making it inaccurate.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cP&G continues to be committed to our climate goals while also working on broader solutions that can also help move the industry forward.\u201d\n\n\n[![Sign up for your free email newsletter](/build/images/newsletter-signup.jpg)](https://hpcimedia.com/service/signup-campaign/CBeNews)*Cosmetics

International funding could help smallholder farmers to boost yields on their existing land to incentivise long-term forest protection.**\n\n\nBiodiversity conservation delivers enormous global economic benefits, but net benefits vary widely for different groups of people - with international stakeholders gaining most, and local rural communities bearing substantial costs.\n\n\nThese are the findings of a decade-long study into the costs and benefits of conserving the forests and woodlands of Tanzania\u2019s Eastern Arc Mountains - a global biodiversity hotspot estimated to provide nature-based benefits to the world equivalent to US $8.2 billion.\n\n\nClimate regulation is the primary global benefit from protecting large areas of tropical forest. And although the people living near these forests feel some of this benefit, they also bear substantial conservation costs \u2013 particularly through the loss of potential income gained by clearing trees to expand farming.\n\n\n\u201cInternational gains from the conservation of this biodiversity hotspot far outweigh the gains to local communities directly involved in their conservation,\u201d said Andrew Balmford, Professor of Conservation Science at the University of Cambridge and senior author of the paper.\n\n\nHe added: \u201cLocal rural communities are not incentivised to protect globally important natural habitats. Understandably, their need to make a basic living\u2013 which often involves clearing forests and woodlands for agriculture, timber and charcoal \u2013 has to come first.\u201d\n\n\nIntact tropical forests act as \u2018carbon sinks\u2019, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and helping to regulate the global climate. Conversion of these natural habitats to agricultural land results in vast carbon emissions.\n\n\nThe researchers estimate that international funding of US $2 billion is needed to support people living near forests and woodlands of global importance in Tanzania\u2019s Eastern Arc Mountains. Investments could support smallholder farmers to enhance the productivity of their existing farmland, reducing the need to clear more trees to meet the growing local demand for food.\n\n\n\u201cInvestments that help farmers boost yields on their land would potentially provide a long-term solution to the pressure on natural habitats, without compromising local food production or livelihoods,\u201d said Pantaleo Munishi, Professor of Ecosystems, Biodiversity and Climate Change Management at Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanzania, a co-author of the study.\n\n\nHe added: \u201cFarmers degrade natural resources in search of livelihood options, due to declining productivity on land they own.\u201d\n\n\nThe study also found that the greatest overall global economic gains come from the most biologically important sites \u2013 but these are also most costly for locals to conserve. This means that without financial support, the incentives to clear natural habitats are highest in the most biologically important places.\n\n\n\u201cIf we're serious about retaining these globally important places for society as a whole, the international community ought to be contributing more and not relying on local people to soak up these costs,\u201d said Dr Phil Platts at the University of York and BeZero Carbon, first author of the report.\n\n\nHe added: \u201cAlthough vastly more money is required for the conservation of key regions than the international community is spending at the moment, in the wider scheme of things it\u2019s entirely doable.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe huge demand for cropland in Tanzania, not just from smallholders, leads to clearing forests and woodlands - many of which aren\u2019t formally protected.\u00a0 Smallholders are pushed further and further into the mountains because they need to make a living,\u201d said Dr Marije Schaafsma at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, one of the study\u2019s lead authors.\n\n\nThis is the largest and most detailed study of its type ever undertaken in the tropics. The results are [published today in the journal *Environmental and Resource Economics*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-023-00798-y)*.*\n\n\nTanzania\u2019s Eastern Arc Mountains are considered a global priority for conservation, and following extensive forest clearance, local and national governments have established a network of protected areas to help to conserve the remaining biodiversity and sustain ecosystem services.\n\n\nThe Eastern Arc is home to almost 500 species of plants not known to exist anywhere else in the world and many unusual animals including a tree-dwelling crab, and a monkey previously unknown to western science called the kipunji.\n\n\nAs well as supporting biodiversity, the forests draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, are home to widely used medicinal plants, provide drinking water to major cities, and support national and international tourism. But conserving them also leads to loss of potential income from agriculture and timber sales, and incurs significant management costs.\n\n\n\u201cTropical forests should be viewed as essential global infrastructure, and richer countries have a responsibility to step up and enable their conservation in an equitable way,\u201d said Professor Brendan Fisher at the University of Vermont, a co-author of the study.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Journal\n\n\nEnvironmental and Resource Economics\n\n\n\n\n#### DOI\n\n\n[10.1007/s10640-023-00798-y](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-023-00798-y) \n\n\n\n\n#### Article Title\n\n\nInequitable gains and losses from conservation in a global biodiversity hotspot\n\n\n\n\n#### Article Publication Date\n\n\n17-Aug-2023\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Local communities in Tanzania's Eastern Arc Mountains, a global biodiversity hotspot, are not incentivized to protect tropical forests due to the lack of financial support and the need for agricultural land.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Local communities bear substantial conservation costs and are not incentivized to protect natural habitats."}, {"summary": "International funding of $2 billion is needed to support local communities living near forests and woodlands in Tanzania's Eastern Arc Mountains.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The funding is aimed at supporting smallholder farmers to enhance existing farmland productivity and reduce the need for clearing more trees."}, {"summary": "The study highlights the importance of international financial support for conserving globally important places and the need to not rely solely on local communities.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The international community should contribute more to conserve globally important places."}], "semantic_commentary": "International funding crucial for protecting forests, supporting local communities.\n", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_o1", "reason": "The article is not related to carbon."}]}, {"source": "The Bakersfield Californian", "link": "https://www.bakersfield.com/ap/news/california-resources-corporation-releases-2022-sustainability-update-detailing-progress-on-sustainability-initiatives-and-esg-performance/article_ccdeaa9a-d819-5a37-bb33-776dda83eeba.html", "title": "California Resources Corporation Releases 2022 Sustainability Update Detailing Progress on Sustainability Initiatives and ESG Performance | News | bakersfield.com", "content": "\n\nLONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug 17, 2023--\n\nCalifornia Resources Corporation (NYSE: CRC) today announced the publication of its [2022 Sustainability Update](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crc.com%2F2022SustainabilityUpdate&esheet=53541093&newsitemid=20230817420569&lan=en-US&anchor=2022+Sustainability+Update&index=1&md5=f520a2ffe5a5871ab398fe3a01c44aca).

This is according to a [2022 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31258-8) by researchers from Brazil, Australia, the U.S., France, Portugal, the U.K. and Sweden. They found that these bodies of water trap 113.5 grams of carbon per square meter per year in their sediment, while previous studies have shown that the forest absorbs an average of 81.72 grams per square meter per year.\n\n\nThe research also revealed that lakes located in tropical regions with preserved forests sequester 10% of the carbon in these locations. In addition, it showed that tropical lakes absorb three times more carbon than temperate ones, and 10 times more than lakes located in subpolar regions.\n\n\nThe researchers analyzed the sediments deposited at the bottom of the lakes, which are rich in organic matter. \n\n\n\u201cThis carbon is in the form of biomass,\u201d Leonardo Amora-Nogueira, who led the study as part of his Ph.D. in geography at Fluminense Federal University (UFF), told Mongabay by phone. \u201cForests sequester carbon, aggregate it in biomass for growth, and when they die, it is carried to the lake and accumulated. This accumulation in the sediment prevents degradation from occurring and this carbon from being emitted into the atmosphere in the form of gas. The material at the bottom of the lakes acts as a carbon reservoir.\u201d\n\n\nFellow researcher Rodrigo Abuchacra, from Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), said aquatic environments are the main destination of sediment production, surface and underground runoff, as well as terrestrial biomass and water in the surroundings and in the lake itself. \n\n\n\u201cConsequently, much of this production ends up deposited at the bottom of lake water bodies, and sediments are natural records of the evolution of these environments,\u201d Abuchacra told Mongabay by phone.\n\n\nBy investigating each sediment layer in high resolution, he said, it\u2019s possible to trace the trajectory of human interventions in the surroundings. \n\n\n\u201cIt is possible to identify, over time, the different levels of environmental impacts on each of the lakes and compare with other biomes locally and abroad,\u201d he said.\n\n\nThe first step of the research was to compile 43 earlier studies on tropical rainforest lakes from around the world. According to the researchers, this approach doubled the representation of these warmer water bodies in tropical forests when compared to what had been previously reported in the literature. This made it possible to have a better representation of the global distribution of lake carbon burial rates.\n\n\nBased on these data, the researchers found that the ability of lakes to accumulate carbon was closely related to the higher productivity of tropical forests compared to those of other biomes. \n\n\n\u201cThe Amazon [rainforest] is one of the most productive in the world,\u201d Amora-Nogueira said, referring to the sheer mass of vegetation that it generates. \u201cTherefore, the amount of organic matter that ends up being available to be accumulated in the lakes is much higher in this region. This explains the three to 10 times higher values that we find in these tropical rainforest areas, compared to temperate and subpolar regions.\u201d\n\n\n![](https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2023/07/06185118/20230331_112547-scaled.jpg)Sampling of sedimentary layers from lakes such as Cujubim in Brazil\u2019s Rond\u00f4nia state revealed the history of human interventions in the environment.

They studied 13 lakes scattered across a total area of 580,000 square kilometers (224,000 square miles) in two clusters 1,170 km (730 mi) apart. This increased the number of rainforests represented by about 75, or 130%, compared to previously published studies. They analyzed the material deposited at the bottom of the lakes over a period of the last 50 to 100 years. \n\n\n\u201cWe studied a succession of layers, from the oldest at the bottom to the top of the sediments, which are the most recent,\u201d Amora-Nogueira said.\n\n\nTo collect the material, the researchers drilled vertical holes in the sediment at the bottom of the lakes at the point of greatest depth, extracting core samples up to 90 centimeters (35 inches) long. \n\n\n\u201cThus, we collected and preserved a sequence of layers, starting from what was deposited before and what was then stored there over time until reaching the present day. Then we took these tubes to the laboratory and cut them into 2-centimeter [nearly 1-inch] slices, and then we analyzed them. The most important thing is that they told us exactly how old each one was,\u201d Amora-Nogueira said. \n\n\nTo accurately date the samples, the team used lead-210, an isotope that occurs naturally and decays at a known and constant rate of about 22 years, turning into bismuth. Based on this known decay rate, the researchers were able to assess the age of each layer and carried out organic carbon analyses to verify the effective amount in each sample.\n\n\nThis way, it was possible to verify all the changes that occurred in the surroundings of the lakes, whether natural or human-driven, that led to an increase or decrease in the accumulation of organic matter into the body of water over the years. In other words, the story of these changes are recorded in the core samples. Thus it was possible to verify that deforestation, detected from satellite imagery, was linked to reduced rates of carbon sequestration. \n\n\n\u201cThrough geoprocessing, we were able to know the size of the area that was deforested and the period when the forest was cleared,\u201d Amora-Nogueira said. \u201cAnd from the evidence at the bottom of the lake, we were able to capture this decrease or increase, which coincides exactly with these dates that were verified in the satellite images.\u201d\n\n\n![](https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2023/07/06184923/20230329_101528-scaled.jpg)Local boaters helped the researchers collect the sediment core samples from the lake beds in Brazil\u2019s Rond\u00f4nia state. Image courtesy of Thayriny Fonseca.\nTheir superior carbon sequestration capacity notwithstanding, the world\u2019s natural lakes are tiny compared to its forests. They cover approximately 2.67 million km2 (1.03 mi2), or 1.8% of the Earth\u2019s surface, in almost all climatic zones. In the Amazon, there are about 15,000 lakes occupying an area of approximately 20,000 km2 (7,700 mi2), or 1% of the total rainforest area, and sequester 2.7 million metric tons of carbon per year.\n\n\nThis volume may be an underestimate, however, because there are lakes beneath the tree canopy that don\u2019t show up in satellite imagery and therefore aren\u2019t studied. In addition, sediment that accumulates in river floodplains and swampy areas haven\u2019t been assessed. In any case, the study\u2019s findings may also serve to determine priority areas for conservation, which should include both terrestrial and wetland ecosystems.\n\n\nThe importance of lakes within river basins comes from the fact that these are environments of intensive organic material deposition, with recent carbon burial rates generally high, playing an essential role in the global CO2 cycle, which makes lakes\u2019 capacity disproportionate to their relatively small area. \n\n\n\u201cOur study was able to provide evidence that, despite being small in area, these lakes have a very large capacity to absorb carbon,\u201d Amora-Nogueira said.\n\n\nHumberto Marotta, Amora-Nogueira\u2019s Ph.D. adviser at UFF, told Mongabay by phone that the lakes may be small in area, but they receive contributions from vast areas of the drainage basin: rivers flow into them, surface runoff reaches them over the ground, and water absorbed into the soil also finds its way to them through the water table. \n\n\n\u201cAt the same time, lakes are ecosystems conducive to the deposition and accumulation of inorganic and organic materials,\u201d he added.\n\n\nMarotta said that when considering the importance of the forest, it\u2019s necessary to preserve not only the trees, but also the lakes and other bodies of water as a whole. \n\n\n\u201cWe have to put on the conservation radar not only water and food security and the preservation of biodiversity wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that is fundamental, but we have to think in terms of carbon credit, the preservation of lakes to accumulate biomass and avoid the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And to emphasize our finding that deforested areas have less biomass accumulated in the lakes.\u201d\n\n\nAccording to Amora-Nogueira, the study represents an initial effort to understand carbon sequestration by tropical rainforest lakes. \n\n\n\u201cGiven all the diversity found in these environments, much research is still needed to understand this relationship between organic matter produced by the forest and what is accumulated in the lakes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other hand, it was a fundamental research, which ended up inserting data from different regions. We showed that these lakes in these humid tropical regions have a capacity to accumulate carbon that is much higher than what we found for other biomes.\u201d\n\n\nHe added that ecosystem conservation shouldn\u2019t be focused solely on carbon accumulation capacity. There\u2019s also the rich biodiversity and ecosystem services that are lost when these deforestation events occur. \n\n\n\u201cWhen we think about the discussion about the carbon market, if it is not associated with the protection of ecosystems, it becomes empty,\u201d Amora-Nogueira said. \u201cWhat we also draw attention to in the work is that it is necessary to look at biodiversity sustained by this environment. And also for the people who live in those places and depend on those natural functions, which are offered by that ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\nFurther research into this issue can help address other aspects that were left out. The researchers say higher annual temperatures may actively stimulate the degradation of considerable amounts of carbon trapped at the bottom of these tropical lakes, increasing uncertainty about the role of temperature variation in determining sediment burial rates. This degradation may also eventually release large amounts of carbon.\n\n\n\u00a0  \n\n***Banner image:** Amazonian lakes like Puruzinho, in Brazil\u2019s Amazonas state, capture 39% more carbon per unit area than the rainforest itself.

This study responds to a question that has long been on EU policy makers' desk: what is the condition of our forests in Europe?\n\nHaving a clear picture of the state of our forests is the first step to support conservation and restoration efforts as set in the [European Green Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en). \u00a0Specific targets for forest ecosystems are included in the [EU\u2019s biodiversity](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en) and [forest strategies](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/forest-strategy_en), as well as the target on net greenhouse gas removals from land use, land use change and forestry ([LULUCF](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/839/oj)).\n\nThe most recent policy instrument, adopted by the European Commission on 22 June 2022, is a proposal for a [nature restoration law](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/nature-restoration-law_en) with legally binding targets for the restoration of forest ecosystems. This proposal expects EU Member States to restore degraded forest ecosystems to a good condition by 2050.\n\nThis JRC study supports EU forest conservation efforts by providing a **first EU-wide baseline that is comparable across countries,** and a method to assess across the board the condition of protected ad unprotected forests.\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "One third of European forests are in decline, with forest degradation indicated by lower soil health, lower tree cover density, and a reduction in species richness of threatened birds", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The decline in European forests indicates a negative trend in forest condition."}, {"summary": "The condition of European forests has shown a mild positive trend since 2000, but further restoration and improvements in forest management are needed", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The positive trend in forest condition is only mild, and the need for further restoration and improvements indicates a neutral sentiment."}, {"summary": "A large-scale study of European forests using international standards to assess forest health has been conducted for the first time", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The use of international standards to assess forest health is seen as an advantage and supports decision making, indicating a positive sentiment."}, {"summary": "Having a clear picture of the state of forests in Europe is important for supporting conservation and restoration efforts", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Knowing the state of forests is crucial for supporting conservation and restoration efforts, indicating a positive sentiment."}, {"summary": "A recent study by the JRC supports EU forest conservation efforts by providing a baseline for assessing the condition of forests", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The study supports EU forest conservation efforts and provides a reliable baseline, indicating a positive sentiment."}], "semantic_commentary": "Article relates to the intent as it highlights the importance of conservation efforts.", "sentiment_score": 0.4, "classifications": [{"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon (specifically about the condition of European forests)"}]}, {"source": "Impakter", "link": "https://impakter.com/science-sign-language-200-new-environment-and-climate-signs-created/", "title": "Science Sign Language: 200 New Environment and Climate Signs Created - Impakter", "content": "\nSince 2007, the Scottish Sensory Centre ([SSC](https://www.ssc.education.ed.ac.uk/index.html)) has been building a glossary of subject-specific signs in British Sign Language (BSL) \u2013 amassing around [7,000](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-66464437) signs so far. **This initiative is known as the** [**BSL Glossary Project**](https://www.ssc.education.ed.ac.uk/BSL/about.html)**.**\n\n\nThe group plan to expand the BSL glossary to all areas of curriculum over time, but so far their work has focused on Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nA wide range of terminology specific to STEM topics has been compiled within their BSL sign language [science glossary](https://www.ssc.education.ed.ac.uk/BSL/index.html#top) to date \u2013 everything from astronomy to maths to computer science \u2013 but just recently, a new and extremely timely category of scientific terms was [added](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-66464437) to the list: [**Environmental science**](https://www.ssc.education.ed.ac.uk/BSL/environmenthome.html)**.**\n\n[![](https://www.ftjcfx.com/image-100866476-15334675)![](https://www.ftjcfx.com/image-100866476-15334675)](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100866476-15334675)\nUp until now, BSL users have had to [fingerspell complex terminology](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-66464437) in discussions on matters of climate change and the environment.

Yet smaller countries can face a problem: volume and liquidity levels that are insufficient to determine market pricing effectively; a result of insufficient market participants and investors in an emissions trading system.**** \n\n\nTo address this, some countries and regions have harmonised emissions trading systems, creating larger and more liquid carbon markets.\n\n\nAs part of our Carbon Markets Series, in this insight we consider potential opportunities for cooperation and harmonisation of carbon trading across Southeast Asia and the broader region. This includes:\n\n\n* **Inter-ASEAN cooperation:** A regional trading hub would bring benefits, but the concept is unprecedented in the region and would face obstacles\n* **Cooperation with non-ASEAN countries:** There is merit in exploring opportunities across borders, including with China and Australia \u2013 noting limitations.\n\n\nAs carbon trading in Southeast Asia continues to develop, meaningful collaboration and harmonisation will play an important role in facilitating the development of carbon markets across the region.\n\n\n**For more on carbon, visit our bank of insights on the topic** **[here](https://www.kwm.com/sg/en/insights/topic/carbon.html)**. **To subscribe to our updates, visit our** [**Preference Centre**](https://pages.kwm.com/SubscriptionCentre).\n\n\n**Inter-ASEAN Cooperation**\n\n\nSoutheast Asia is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. And with the region\u2019s growing economies and population sizes, significant growth in energy demand is expected to continue. If a regional cap and trade scheme was in place, the revenue generated from the auction or sale of carbon credits would provide much needed funds to support the development of green energy projects in Southeast Asia. The aggregation of carbon credit supply and demand across the region would also create significant potential scale and help to address the volume and liquidity issues which might otherwise exist within a market specific to a smaller individual member state.\n\n\n**Potential for a Regional Trading Hub**\n\n\nBy working together and overcoming cooperation challenges, the region could become a leading carbon trading hub that captures significant global investments to deliver sustainable growth.\n\n\nWhile the idea of a regulated carbon market across the region is attractive, the reality is that there are several significant obstacles. For example:\n\n\n* common standards would need to be accepted and implemented across the region, and\n* multilateral coordination agreements would need to be struck between the member states, covering matters such as carbon credit allocation.\n\n\nCoordination of this nature and extent is unprecedented in ASEAN. Unlike the EU, ASEAN is not a supranational organisation with the power to make binding regulations over its member states. We have [written previously](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=32719267-f75e-495f-b204-f5d23e0ada11) about the decades old, but unrealised, ambitions for a Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline and integrated gas market.\n\n\nSoutheast Asia nations are still in the early stages of developing emissions trading systems, and adequate time and processes are needed to address the development of frameworks for unified carbon accounting and disclosure.[1] In contrast to a uniform regulated carbon market, some or all Southeast Asian nations could seek to establish a coordinated voluntary carbon trading market via a commercial hub. This centralised approach would offer a platform for trading carbon credits and promote the development of green projects throughout the region.\n\n\nAs is often the case, Singapore is among the frontrunners for regional leadership in this regard and, with the launch of CIX, it has taken material steps towards that end.\n\n\nVoluntary carbon markets face several limitations:\n\n\n* they do not impose an overall cap on carbon generation (caps are determined by individual countries)\n* it may be difficult to use credits generated from a voluntary market to satisfy emission reduction standards in a regulated market\n* certification and standards in voluntary carbon markets are ultimately determined by private entities, and\n* given the differences in monitoring and verification of carbon credits, there is no universal acceptance of a common standard.\n\n\nWhile Singapore has an established reputation as a financial and trading centre, and the establishment of CIX is a positive step, it faces several hurdles before it emerges as a leading carbon trading platform. Furthermore, there is potential for competition in other parts of the world given voluntary carbon markets can in theory be established anywhere (and in respect of credits generated and voluntarily sold, acquired, or traded from any location).\n\n\n**Cooperation with countries outside of Southeast Asia**\n\n\nThere are several opportunities for cooperation with countries outside of Southeast Asia for carbon trading and emissions reduction.\n\n\n**China**\n\n\n*****Logical synergies but some complexity*****\n\n\nOne possibility is the harmonisation of carbon trading markets between China and Southeast Asia. For example, if Southeast Asia provided green credits backed by reforestation and renewable opportunities and China offered demand for such credits from its power generation and manufacturing sectors this could bring significant benefits in terms of scale and liquidity of the carbon trade.\n\n\nChina\u2019s market will be a source of future financial flows for efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation. Cooperation is consistent with China\u2019s overall policy objectives in strengthening economic ties with Southeast Asia. It would also tie in with China's \u201cgreen\u201d belt and road initiatives, including the electrification of transportation, export of green technologies, and cross-border investment and cooperation on renewable energy projects.\n\n\nAlthough attractive in theory, cooperation between Southeast Asia and China in carbon trading would face challenges. In addition to the issues associated with coordination within Southeast Asia, these include:\n\n\n* distinct discrepancies in economic development stages and characteristics\n* complex inter-governmental relationships, and\n* the relatively undeveloped state of carbon markets in many Southeast Asian countries.[2]\n\n\n**Australia**\n\n\n*****Bilateral agreements will help to pave the way*****\n\n\nThere is also notable progress in carbon trading cooperation between Singapore and Australia.\n\n\nOn 18 October 2022, [**trade ministers in Australia and Singapore signed the Green Economy Agreement (GEA)**](https://www.kwm.com/au/en/insights/latest-thinking/australia-and-singapore-trailblaze-with-first-of-its-kind-green-economy-agreement.html). The GEA hopes to facilitate trade and investment between the two countries, remove non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods and services, and accelerate the uptake of green technology to reduce carbon emissions. Implementation of the GEA will begin with developing a list of environmental goods and services that could be given preferential trade treatment.\n\n\nWith similar legal frameworks, it is envisaged that Australia will supply high-quality carbon credits in exchange for Singapore providing the regional hub platform for participants to trade. If realised, Singapore-based corporates who require credits to offset taxable emissions will be able to purchase credits from renewable or carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in Australia.\n\n\nGiven the differences between the countries within Southeast Asia and the nature of the regional grouping, cooperation with non-ASEAN countries is likely to take place on bilateral rather than multilateral basis. We predict bilateral agreements will help pave the way for the gradual development of carbon markets in the region.\n\n\nAn ambition for the GEA shared by Singapore and Australia is that it will provide a precedent and pathways for, and stimulate, wider cooperation in the region.\n\n\nWhile Singapore has its recently established global carbon exchange, CIX, in Australia the regulated carbon scheme is national in scope. In mid-July 2023, Australia\u2019s scheme \u2013 [known as the Safeguard Mechanism](https://www.kwm.com/au/en/insights/latest-thinking/the-safeguard-mechanism-is-now-law-heres-your-to-do-list-for-australias-new-carbon-rules.html) \u2013 was amended to introduce new emissions baselines for large industrial facilities that will decrease over time. This is expected to cut emissions.\n\n\nDespite the absence of a cross-border element, the scheme will indirectly affect voluntary markets.\n\n\nIn time, as global markets develop and become increasingly sophisticated, more local markets may open to cross-border carbon credit trades. This is especially given the rapidly increasing demand. We are watching this space.\n\n\n**With the rapid developments in the space and the escalating transition it is critical to consider the **possibilities \u2013 including the important role collaboration and harmonisation can play.****\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Carbon markets are crucial for achieving GHG emissions reduction commitments, but smaller countries face challenges in determining market pricing due to low volume and liquidity.

Credit: Richard Whitcombe via Shutterstock\n\n\nThe voluntary carbon market (VCM) is a decentralised global market in which individuals and corporations can opt-in to buying and selling carbon credits, representing some form of environmental or climate action. The VCM first began in the 1990s, but only really took off towards the end of the last decade, as companies increasingly seek to align themselves with tightening national and global emissions reduction targets, as well as addressing a growing public demand for action against climate change.\n\n\nOften climate credits are bought by companies with emissions offsets in mind, enabling polluters such as non-renewable power plants to balance their emissions for \u201cnet zero\u201d. These come largely from carbon sequestration projects, such as reforestation, mangrove swamp restoration, or engineered carbon removal facilities. Some come from biodiversity projects or social programmes.\n\n\n ### Recommended Reports\n\n* ![ReportsLogo](https://pr-fr-json-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/pharmaceutical-technology/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/report.png)[Reports](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/)#### [Environment Sustainability in Power: Ethylene Co-Polymer Pv Modules](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/ethylene-co-polymer-pv-modules-environment-sustainability-in-power-innovation-and-trend-analysis?scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n[GlobalData](https://www.globaldata.com/)\n* ![ReportsLogo](https://pr-fr-json-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/pharmaceutical-technology/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/report.png)[Reports](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/)#### [China Waste to Energy Market Summary, Competitive Analysis and Forecast to 2027](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/china-waste-to-energy-market-analysis?scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n[GlobalData](https://www.globaldata.com/)\n\n [View all](https://www.globaldata.com/store/industry/power-market/)### Companies Intelligence\n\n#### [Shell plc](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1543695&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n#### [BP Plc](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1375079&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n#### [Chevron Corp](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1544307&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n#### [easyJet Plc](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1013936&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n#### [Gucci](https://www.globaldata.com/store/?s=Gucci&scalar=true&searchKeyName=companyname&pid=305193&sid=21)\n\n[View all](https://www.globaldata.com/companies/)\nAt their core, voluntary carbon credits are a way for corporations to offset difficult-to-decarbonise emissions, and to signal a level of movement against climate change. However, exactly what this movement entails can be vague or undefined, because taxonomies and regulation within the VCM remain lax. \u201cCurrently, there are over 170 different ways to generate a carbon credit,\u201d Luke Leslie, CEO and co-founder of carbon credits supplier [Carbon Neutral Royalty](https://www.carbonneutralltd.com/), told *Future Power Technology.* The variety of carbon credits range drastically from \u201chigh-integrity\u201d projects with genuine environmental effect, to those with little or no impact. These categories, Leslie says, \u201care fast evolving\u201d.\n\n\nHere lies the crux of the debate. While some organisations hail carbon credits as an authentic method of decarbonisation, a necessary addition to corporations\u2019 journeys to net zero, other groups argue that they are ultimately a [scam](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/50689/carbon-offsets-net-zero-greenwashing-scam/), giving companies an easy but ineffective alternative to reducing their own emissions. So which is it, and how might changing regulations affect the VCM landscape?\n\n\nLax regulation breeds \u201cworthless\u201d offsets\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nAlready this year, several scandals relating to corporate misuse of carbon credits have made headlines. Two in particular have stuck out. The first came in mid-January when a [joint investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) by the UK\u2019s *The* *Guardian,* Germany\u2019s *Die Zeit* and online climate reporters *SourceMaterial* revealed that more than 90% of rainforest offsets offered by Verra, the world\u2019s leading carbon credits certifier, were likely to be \u201cphantom credits\u201d and did not represent genuine emissions reductions. Multinationals including Disney, [Shell](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1543695&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21), [BP](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1375079&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21), [easyJet](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1013936&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21), Leon, and Gucci used Verra\u2019s credits to earn low-carbon branding for their goods. Now, it seems that these labels were never truly earned.\n\n\nSpecifically, the investigation found that only a handful of Verra\u2019s rainforest projects showed evidence of tangible deforestation reductions, with further analysis suggesting that 94% of the credits sold to companies had no benefit regarding climate change. In at least one of Verra\u2019s carbon offsetting projects, human rights violations were a serious concern. On a visit to a major project in Peru, journalists at *The* *Guardian* were shown videos that residents said depicted their homes being destroyed with chainsaws and ropes by guards and police working alongside carbon credit companies. Local people also described forced evictions from their homes.\n\n\nVera criticised the investigation\u2019s methodology and said the conclusions drawn were \u201cincorrect\u201d. The company also said that since 2009, its work has enabled billions of dollars to be put into forest preservation and restoration.\n\n\nChevron using \u201cjunk\u201d carbon credits\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nThen in mid-May, [a study](https://corporateaccountability.org/resources/chevrons-junk-agenda-report/) looking at oil giant [Chevron](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1544307&scalar=true&pid=305193&sid=21)\u2019s use of carbon offsets made headlines. The report, titled *\u201cDestruction is at the* *heart of everything we do\u201d,* came from NGO watchdog Corporate Accountability. It found that 93% of Chevron\u2019s carbon credits, purchased through the VCM to offset some of its own substantial emissions, \u201cseem to be worthless\u201d or actively harm communities. Both its natural and engineered carbon removal projects are either \u201cjunk\u201d, contributing nothing to emissions reductions, or severely underperforming, sometimes missing targets by 50%. The study found that 42% of the company\u2019s offset schemes are linked to claims of local community abuse or environmental degradation, and could be further fuelling climate breakdown.\n\n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for Chevron challenged the report\u2019s conclusions. \u201cThe cited report is biased against our industry and paints an incomplete picture of Chevron\u2019s efforts to advance a lower carbon future,\u201d external affairs adviser Bill Turenne said in an email to [*Offshore Technology*](https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/chevron-carbon-offsets-junk-or-harmful/#catfish). \u201cChevron supports offsets as part of that effort and views them as an important market-based approach to efficient carbon reductions.\u201d Turenne added that \u201cthe majority\u201d of the credits referred to in the study are \u201ccompliance-grade\u201d and accepted by the governments in the regions where the company operates.\n\n\nDespite recent scandal, properly selected and well-calculated carbon credits are considered to be a useful tool in funding climate change mitigation projects. The UK\u2019s independent climate advisory body the [Climate Change Committee](https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/voluntary-carbon-markets-and-offsetting/#:~:text=Voluntary%20carbon%20markets%20are%20markets,to%20'offset'%20their%20emissions.) encourages the use of \u201chigh-integrity\u201d nature-based and biological credits by businesses as an additional means of climate action, although it states that even top-quality credits can play but a \u201csmall role\u201d in the transition to net zero.\n\n\n\u201cMaking carbon market buyers a bit more careful\u201d\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn January, on the same day as the publication of the Verra investigation, Nat Keohane, president of the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions in the US, told [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/carbon-markets-credits-offsets-deforestation-aoe): \u201cWe need to use every channel we can for funding\u2026 We can\u2019t leave anything on the table. We know that we will not be able to meet even 2\u00b0C if we do not end tropical deforestation,\u201d but reiterated that carbon credits \u201cshould be complimentary, not a substitute\u201d for cutting emissions.\n\n\nWhen asked about the possible effects of bad press on the VCM as a whole, Leslie said that he sees the scrutiny as a \u201cpositive\u201d. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is much more attention from the media on the VCM, and this is all part of the VCM\u2019s growing pains,\u201d he says. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s just pausing immediate decisions and it\u2019s making buyers a bit more careful about what they buy, making sure that they do their own their own diligence.\n\n\n\u201cThings need to continue improving quickly in order to for the VCM to scale up,\u201d he adds, explaining that scrutiny is \u201cneeded\u201d so that improvements can be made to the methodologies used to calculate a carbon credit\u2019s worth. \u201cAnd you can see these methodologies getting updated all the time,\u201d he reassures, but concedes that stories of worthless or harmful carbon offsets \u201care not great, reputationally\u201d for the VCM.\n\n\n\u201cI think in the short-term it does shake a market that is fragile, but it\u2019s a difficult one. You always need to have this scrutiny in order for change to accelerate. The way that the VCM operates today needs to be improved.\u201d\n\n\nThe turning of the tide\n-----------------------\n\n\nIn the middle of July something did happen: the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMII), an international non-profit organisation that defines standards for carbon credit trading, published an updated [code of practice](https://vcmintegrity.org/vcmi-claims-code-of-practice/) setting out rules on how to use carbon credits in ways that accelerate climate change mitigation.\n\n\nThe new code, developed through a multi-organisational collaborative process with stakeholders, provides recommendations and guidance to corporations and other non-state actors on how they can credibly use carbon credits to make genuine environmental claims, and what specifically these claims can be. The rules aim to set a global standardised method for assessing the quality of corporate environmental claims, in an effort to stave off accusations of greenwashing and salvage the VCM\u2019s reputation. The code also advises companies looking to purchase \u201chigh-integrity\u201d credits to do so from another standards body, the [Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market](https://icvcm.org/), which is due to publish its own guidelines on what makes a \u201cquality\u201d credit soon.\n\n\nPerhaps most significant is the code\u2019s official recommendation that companies stop claiming that carbon credits offset, or \u201ccancel out\u201d, their own emissions. Instead, it suggests that credits should only be used to contribute to climate change mitigation as an additional step to an organisation\u2019s own direct emissions reductions. It also states that these reductions should be clearly and transparently disclosed on an annual basis to show, in scientific terms, how they meet targets that align with the Paris Agreement.\n\n\nThe VCMII\u2019s new recommendations shake the foundations upon which carbon credits were built. Currently, they are used overwhelmingly by organisations to make emissions-based environmental claims, to claim \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d while still polluting. \u201cIt could have quite a few ripple effects within the VCM,\u201d Leslie says.\n\n\nEnabling carbon markets to scale up\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\u201cIt should be positive because what [the VCMII] is saying is: \u2018you can\u2019t use this for compensation claims, but you can use it for beyond-value contribution claims\u2019. Companies are nervous about buying a credit and making an [environmental] claim and then getting attacked for it. If you remove that ability to be criticized, then it may mobilise more buyers and more demand.\u201d In other words, clarifying the intended use of carbon credits could remove the possibility of backlash making an enticing, risk-free prospect for companies.\n\n\n\u201cBut the other effect which we\u2019re still working through is: what does this mean in terms of the type of carbon credit that buyers buy? Because if it\u2019s not to offset, if it\u2019s just a contribution, well, does that mean the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals are going to become more important? Does it mean there will be more of a focus on biodiversity? What we need to see now is more guidance on how these framework-setters intend these new claims to operate. We can then take a view on what that means from a demand perspective.\u201d\n\n\nTightening taxonomies and regulations, in theory, leaves less room for dishonesty, making scandal less common and greenwashing more difficult. More clear and precise methodologies for calculating the value of a carbon credit will also aid companies in navigating their way to authentic environmental credentials. According to Leslie, the voluntary market still needs to grow \u201cby about a hundred times what it is today\u201d. If the VCM is here not just to stay, but also to scale up, regulatory frameworks will have to keep improving to guarantee corporate responsibility and ensure corporate accountability. Leslie concludes: \u201cWe want to see this happening much faster than it is.\u201d\n\n\n \n\n \nShare this article\n\n[![](https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/icons/email_icon.svg)](mailto:type%20email%20address%20here?subject=I%20wanted%20to%20share%20this%20post%20with%20you%20from%20Power%20Technology&body=The%20voluntary%20carbon%20market:%20can%20tightening%20regulations%20combat%20corporate%20greenwashing?%20-%20https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-credits-greenwashing-market/)\n[![](https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/icons/linkedin_icon.svg)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-credits-greenwashing-market/)\n[![](https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/icons/twitter_icon.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+voluntary+carbon+market%3A+can+tightening+regulations+combat+corporate+greenwashing%3F%0a&url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-credits-greenwashing-market/&via=Power_OnlineMag)\n[![](https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/icons/facebook_icon.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.power-technology.com/features/carbon-credits-greenwashing-market/)\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The voluntary carbon market (VCM) allows individuals and corporations to buy and sell carbon credits as a form of environmental action.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The VCM is described as a way for corporations to offset emissions and signal action against climate change.

This is an exceedingly unusual move by the CFTC. It signals an aggressive new posture in its regulation of the nascent market for carbon allowances, carbon credits, and other environmental commodities, including \"tokenized\" credits. Less than two weeks later, the CFTC [announced](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWJzY3JpYmVyX2lkIjoiMjE1OTY1NTgzNCIsImJ1bGxldGluX2xpbmtfaWQiOiIxMDIiLCJ1cmkiOiJicDI6ZGlnZXN0IiwibGlua19pZCI6IjMyNjMxMTAzNTUiLCJidWxsZXRpbl9pZCI6IjIwMjMwNjI5Ljc4OTg4ODUxIiwidXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Z0Yy5nb3YvUHJlc3NSb29tL1ByZXNzUmVsZWFzZXMvODczNi0yMz91dG1fc291cmNlPWdvdmRlbGl2ZXJ5IiwiZW1haWwiOiJkYXJvbkBqb25lc2RheS5jb20ifQ.9AlKb2oSdacRVT1La2UCF_JxjbdFY5XF8UXZQsnYDFE__;!!Dahw-A9d0CA!y1nfcHN9GybKuP-z5Z57lvPEsCTh4rHW4jc01KTOmYJWJ9-CNRVgCHxjxqvW7AjyRhHixt8CPlzmqKncSSoMIg%24) the formation of a new DOE Environmental Fraud Task Force (\"EFTF\") to \"combat environmental fraud and misconduct in derivatives and relevant spot markets.\" The EFTF will be comprised of DOE attorneys and investigators who will prosecute cases, serve as subject-matter experts, and coordinate efforts with the CFTC's other divisions and offices.\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\nThe CFTC has been an early mover among federal financial regulators in asserting jurisdiction over the carbon markets. In fact, on March 17, 2021, [the CFTC established a Climate Risk Unit](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8368-21) (\"CRU\") to focus on the role of derivatives in understanding, pricing, and addressing climate-related risk and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The CRU is comprised of staff from across the CFTC's operating divisions and offices.\n\n\nLast year, the CFTC hosted a public [carbon markets convening](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/Events/opaeventcftccarbonmarketconvene060222). Participants in the convening discussed potential challenges with access to high-quality carbon credits and allowances. Afterwards, the CFTC issued a [request for information](https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2022/06/2022-12302a.pdf) (\"RFI\") on voluntary carbon markets. Among other things, the RFI sought comment on whether those markets are susceptible to fraud and manipulation.\n\n\nTo build upon information gathered at the first convening and public comments submitted in response to the RFI, the CFTC hosted a [second carbon markets convening](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8731-23) on July 19, 2023. This [latest convening](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8754-23) began with the agency [sharing its two main takeaways](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement071923) from the public input it received: (i) the CFTC should employ comprehensive anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority; and (ii) the agency should support the establishment of standards that will expand the use of high-integrity carbon offsets. This convening also commenced the CRU's workstream to draft agency guidance regarding voluntary carbon market standards for the CFTC to review. To assist the CRU in preparing its recommendations, the CFTC also held discussions on the following topics:\n\n\n* Recent private sector initiatives for high-quality carbon credits;\n* Current trends and developments in the cash and derivatives markets for carbon credits;\n* Public sector initiatives related to carbon markets; and\n* Market participants' perspectives on how the CFTC can promote integrity for high-quality carbon credit derivatives.\n\n\n**Whistleblower Alert and Environmental Fraud Task Force**\n\n\n[The press release announcing the whistleblower alert](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8723-23) highlighted that potential fraud in carbon markets includes manipulative and wash trading, \"ghost\" credits, double counting, fraudulent statements relating to material terms of the carbon credits, and potential manipulation of tokenized carbon markets. The whistleblower alert and the creation of the EFTF are likely outgrowths of these other recent efforts to understand the carbon markets. The EFTF, among other things, is empowered to examine fraud with respect to the purported environmental benefits of purchased carbon credits and material misrepresentations regarding ESG products or strategies. In announcing the formation of the EFTF, CFTC Chairman Behnam stated that the creation of the EFTF \"demonstrates the vigorous and forward-looking approach the CFTC will take to address misconduct in th[is] critical area[].\"\n\n\nThese actions and the statement made by Chairman Behnam indicate that the CFTC will prioritize enforcement as it navigates its path forward in carbon markets. Regulation by enforcement is also the most logical path, as the CFTC does not have the authority to substantively regulate cash markets the way it does derivatives markets.\n\n\nTips from whistleblowers often lead directly to CFTC investigations. Approximately half the CFTC's annual enforcement docket stems from whistleblower reports, and the rewards often are for several million dollars. So the financial incentives for tipping are real. Firms, therefore, should anticipate increased government investigations and monitor for settlements and other potential litigation by the CFTC. It therefore may be advisable for firms to consider developing whistleblower policies for their carbon market activities or applying existing policies to that activity. In doing so, firms may wish to consider evaluating whether those policies align with CFTC anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements.\n\n\nTo hear more about CFTC's enforcement initiatives for carbon credit markets, check out the Firm's [Jones Day Talks](https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2023/07/looking-for-esg-fraud-cftc-solicits-carbon-markets-whistleblowers) podcast.\n\n\n*Read the full [Climate Report](https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2023/08/the-climate-report-third-quarter-2023).*\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has issued an alert soliciting tips about potential fraud and manipulation in carbon markets, signaling a more aggressive approach in its regulation.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The alert suggests that fraud and manipulation are present in carbon markets, which is a negative development."}, {"summary": "The CFTC has established a new Environmental Fraud Task Force (EFTF) to combat environmental fraud and misconduct in derivatives and spot markets.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The creation of the EFTF shows a proactive approach by the CFTC in addressing environmental fraud, which is a positive step."}, {"summary": "The CFTC has been focusing on the role of derivatives in understanding and addressing climate-related risk, establishing a Climate Risk Unit (CRU) for this purpose.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "This information does not indicate a positive or negative sentiment; it is a neutral statement of the CFTC's focus on derivatives and climate-related risk."}, {"summary": "The CFTC has been gathering information on carbon markets through public convenings and requests for information, with the aim of establishing comprehensive anti-fraud measures and supporting high-integrity carbon offsets.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The CFTC's efforts to gather information and establish anti-fraud measures are positive steps towards regulating carbon markets effectively."}, {"summary": "The whistleblower alert issued by the CFTC emphasizes potential fraud in carbon markets, including manipulative trading, ghost credits, double counting, and fraudulent statements.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The highlighted potential fraud in carbon markets suggests a negative and concerning situation."}, {"summary": "The CFTC's actions and statements indicate a priority on enforcement and regulation by enforcement in carbon markets.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The focus on enforcement and regulation suggests a challenging and potentially negative environment for carbon markets."}, {"summary": "Whistleblower tips often lead to CFTC investigations, and firms should anticipate increased government investigations and consider developing whistleblower policies for their carbon market activities.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "This information does not indicate a positive or negative sentiment; it is a neutral statement about the potential impact of whistleblower tips on investigations and the need for firms to be prepared."}], "semantic_commentary": "Increased scrutiny on carbon markets; organizations should be prepared for investigations.", "sentiment_score": -0.14285714285714285, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) establishing a new Environmental Fraud Task Force (EFTF) to combat environmental fraud and misconduct in carbon markets."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions the CFTC focusing on understanding and addressing climate-related risk, which indicates a commitment towards reducing the carbon footprint."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon markets, including potential fraud and manipulation in carbon markets."}]}, {"source": "CEPR", "link": "https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/carbon-costs-and-stock-market-performance-new-evidence-european-firms", "title": "Carbon costs and stock market performance: New evidence from European firms | CEPR", "content": "\nAs the EU climate policies are getting increasingly stringent, it is becoming more expensive for the European firms to continue emitting CO2. The price of emission allowances within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) increased from \u20ac10 to more than \u20ac100 per tonne of CO2 between early 2018 and early 2023. With firms facing higher carbon costs, this factor is becoming more important for market pricing of firms with different degrees of carbon intensity. If the stock market punishes high emitters and rewards low emitters in response to carbon price changes, this reinforces the effectiveness of climate policy in redirecting financing towards sustainable activities.\n\n\nFirst empirical studies on the relationship between companies\u2019 stock performance and the carbon price were published a few years after the launch of the EU ETS in 2005 (Oberndorfer 2009, Mo et al. 2012). Subsequent papers extended the analysis by gradually increasing the period and the number of firms included in the sample (Oestreich and Tsiakas 2015, Tian et al. 2016). At that stage there was no clear consensus in the literature as to the sign of the stock price-carbon price relationship. Results differed depending on the choice of countries, companies, periods, and analytical approaches. At the same time, most papers concluded that the magnitude of the relationship is fairly *small*: a 1% change in the carbon price tends to coincide with a stock price change of only a few basis points. Another broadly confirmed result is that the interaction between stock and carbon price changes is not stable over time. This evolution is typically explained by changes in the rules governing the EU ETS.[1](#footnote1_0yh532f \"Scroll down to this footnote\")\n\u00a0\n\n\nMore recent studies provide more consistent evidence on how firms\u2019 stock prices are affected by carbon price changes. Ramelli et al. (2018) showed that investors rewarded highly emissive US firms following a sudden shift to less stringent climate policy after President Trump\u2019s election in 2016. Bolton and Kacperczyk (2021a, 2021b) show the presence of a \u2018carbon premium\u2019 that investors demand from firms with a higher exposure to carbon risk. Finally, Hennge et al. (2023) found empirical evidence that policy announcements which increase carbon prices have a negative effect on the stock prices of carbon-intensive firms.\n\n\nHow large are firms\u2019 carbon related costs?\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn our recent paper (Millischer et al. 2022) we analyse a novel dataset of more than 300 publicly traded EU companies covered by the EU ETS. Specifically, we explore the relationships between EU companies\u2019 stock performance and changes in the carbon price. The European power generating sector is particularly exposed to the developments on the carbon market. Since 2017, its spending on emissions allowances[2](#footnote2_oi7zm71 \"Scroll down to this footnote\")\n has jumped from around 1% to more than 3% of turnover (Figure 1). For most companies from other sectors the carbon costs do not exceed 0.5% of their turnover. This difference between the scale of exposure is linked to varying carbon pricing approach across sectors. Indeed, companies in sectors other than power generation still get the majority of their emission allowances for free (Figure 2). These sectors (such as steel and cement production) tend to be more exposed to competition from outside the EU, so the EU hands out free allowances to them to avoid replacing domestic production with imports (the \u2018carbon leakage\u2019 effect).\n\n\n**Figure 1** Paid carbon intensity by industry (% of turnover)\n\n\n\n\n![Figure 1 Paid carbon intensity by industry](/sites/default/files/styles/flexible_wysiwyg/public/2023-08/evdokimova18augfig1.png?itok=uL1_muK9)\n\n\n\n\n\n![Figure 1 Paid carbon intensity by industry](/sites/default/files/styles/popup_small/public/2023-08/evdokimova18augfig1.png?itok=rQJqMiL0)\n\n\n\n\n**Figure 2** The share of purchased emission allowances in total emission allowances (%)\n\n\n\n\n![Figure 2 The share of purchased emission allowances in total emission allowances ](/sites/default/files/styles/flexible_wysiwyg/public/2023-08/evdokimova18augfig2.png?itok=s6QHzPw1)\n\n\n\n\n\n![Figure 2 The share of purchased emission allowances in total emission allowances ](/sites/default/files/styles/popup_small/public/2023-08/evdokimova18augfig2.png?itok=jpP5HvDE)\n\n\n\n\nHow do markets price in firms\u2019 carbon costs?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nOur paper significantly expands the period and the number of companies in the sample and finds a clear link between companies\u2019 stock performance and changes in the carbon price, which depends on firms\u2019 carbon intensity. The relationship is statistically significant. Stocks of carbon-intensive firms tend to underperform stocks of cleaner peers when the price of carbon increases. While most firms see their stock price actually increase if carbon prices increase (Figure 3) \u2013 probably because they benefit from higher prices passed on to consumers without incurring commensurate carbon costs \u2013 polluting firms with carbon costs above 1.7% of turnover will see their stock price *decline*. This effect is persistent and particularly strong in the power generating sector and in the countries with the highest carbon costs. The effect has also intensified in the recent period of rapid carbon price increases.\n\n\n**Figure 3** Sensitivity of the stock return to a 1% increase in carbon price as a function of the paid carbon intensity\n\n\n\n\n![Figure 3 Sensitivity of the stock return to a 1% increase in carbon price as a function of the paid carbon intensity](/sites/default/files/styles/flexible_wysiwyg/public/2023-08/evdokimova18augfig3.png?itok=dmM9kVju)\n\n\n\n\n\n![Figure 3 Sensitivity of the stock return to a 1% increase in carbon price as a function of the paid carbon intensity](/sites/default/files/styles/popup_small/public/2023-08/evdokimova18augfig3.png?itok=NdaV0fHc)\n\n\n\n\nCrucially, we show that markets price in only the costs of purchased emissions allowances, while emissions covered by the allowances allocated to the firms for free do not affect the relationship between carbon prices and stock returns. In other words, stock markets do not seem to care about the overall level of firms\u2019 emissions but only about their fraction that has a direct impact on firms\u2019 *profitability*. Markets do price in the size of emissions covered by free allowances only on the days (identified by Kanzig 2022) when regulation regarding free allocation is updated. This makes sense given that more stringent rules on free allocation increase transition risks for polluting firms that do not yet have to pay much for their emissions.\u00a0\n\n\nRoom for more ambitious climate policies\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nOur results suggest that simple emissions data disclosure might not be enough to improve markets\u2019 ability to channel funds towards more sustainable projects. Once combined with a carbon pricing scheme, however, it creates a quantifiable incentive channel for shareholders and management to decarbonise firms\u2019 operations. More ambitious carbon pricing policies could strengthen these incentives.\n\n\nHigher carbon costs for firms within the EU ETS can be achieved in three ways. The first is by making sure the price of allowances continues to rise. While in a cap-and-trade system direct price control is impossible, strengthening the Market Stability Reserve or introducing an explicit price floor, as suggested by Ohlendorf et al. (2022), would have such an effect. The second is by phasing out free allowances. This could be done quickly for domestic air travel without impact on competitiveness and gradually for the manufacturing sector alongside the introduction of a carbon border adjustment. The third way is by subjecting further sectors to the EU ETS \u2013 currently, heating, transport, agriculture, and waste management are largely excluded from the scheme.\n\n\nThe EU ETS provides incentives for firms to decarbonise, including, as we have shown, via their stock prices. The EU should strengthen such incentives. The EU\u2019s experience can guide other countries considering implementing carbon pricing schemes of their own.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n\nBolton, P and M Kacperczyk (2021a), \u201cDo investors care about carbon risk?\u201d, *Journal of Financial Economics* 142(2): 517\u2013549.\n\n\nBolton, P and M Kacperczyk (2021b), \u201c[Global Pricing of Carbon-Transition Risk](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/global-pricing-carbon-transition-risk)\u201d, VoxEU.org, 24 March.\n\n\nHengge, M, U Panizza and R Verghese (2023), \u201c[Carbon policies and stock returns: Signals from financial markets](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/carbon-policies-and-stock-returns-signals-financial-markets)\u201d, VoxEU.org, 6 June.\n\n\nKanzig, D R (2022), \u201cThe unequal economic consequences of carbon pricing\u201d, Working Paper.\n\n\nMillischer, L, T Evdokimova and O Fernandez (2022), \u201c[The Carrot and the Stock: In Search of Stock-Market Incentives for Decarbonization](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/11/18/The-Carrot-and-the-Stock-In-Search-of-Stock-Market-Incentives-for-Decarbonization-525748)\u201d, IMF Working Paper No. 2022/231.\n\n\nMo, J-L, L Zhu and Y Fan (2012), \u201cThe impact of the EU ETS on the corporate value of European electricity corporations\u201d, *Energy* 45(1): 3\u201311.\n\n\nOberndorfer, U (2009), \u201cEU emission allowances and the stock market: Evidence from the electricity industry\u201d.\n\n\nOestreich, A M and I Tsiakas (2015), \u201cCarbon emissions and stock returns: Evidence from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme\u201d, *Journal of Banking & Finance* 58: 294\u2013308.\n\n\nOhlendorf, N, C Flachsland, G F Nemet and J C Steckel (2022), \u201cCarbon price floors and low-carbon investment: A survey of german firms\u201d, *Energy Policy* 169, 113187.\n\n\nRamelli, S, A F Wagner, R Zeckhauser and A Ziegler (2018), \u201c[Stock price rewards to climate saints and sinners: Evidence from Trump\u2019s election](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/stock-price-rewards-climate-saints-and-sinners-evidence-trumps-election)\u201d, VoxEU.org, 29 October.\n\n\nTian, Y, A Akimov, E Roca and V Wong (2016), \u201cDoes the carbon market help or hurt the stock price of electricity companies? further evidence from the EU ETS context\u201d, *Journal of Cleaner Production* 112: 1619\u20131626.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The price of emission allowances within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has increased from \u20ac10 to over \u20ac100 per tonne of CO2 between early 2018 and early 2023, making it more expensive for European firms to emit CO2.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Higher carbon costs for firms may negatively impact their financial performance."}, {"summary": "Recent studies show that firms with higher exposure to carbon risk experience a negative effect on their stock prices when policy announcements increase carbon prices.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Firms with higher exposure to carbon risk are punished in the stock market when carbon prices increase."}, {"summary": "A recent study found that stocks of carbon-intensive firms tend to underperform stocks of cleaner peers when the price of carbon increases.

Some derided the political gimmickry of suggesting that a spending bill dedicated to funneling billions of dollars into green technology was going to reduce inflation. Others insisted the money would be misspent on unproven renewable energy technologies, drawing private funds away from necessary upstream financing for oil and gas exploration. Still others claimed it would take years for projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act to come online, given the extensive permitting process and environmental reviews that these types of projects typically undergo. One year later, the critics remain; but as a series of articles from S&P Global Market Intelligence makes clear, the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act has been seismic. A clean energy renaissance is taking place in the US, and the impact will accelerate as more projects begin operations.\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits for a range of clean energy resources and extended incentives to build solar panels and wind turbines in the US. Companies have announced plans to build or expand 83 clean energy manufacturing facilities. While questions still exist about whether new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells will be covered under the new tax credits, the inducement to build technologies in the US has created a boom in new manufacturing facilities for cleantech. The attempt to [jump-start a homegrown solar panel and wind turbine industry](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/ira-at-1-us-heralds-clean-energy-manufacturing-renaissance-76610817) in the US creates the possibility of global competition with China, which has traditionally dominated these industries.\n\n\nMany critics of the Inflation Reduction Act focused on the incentives designed to spur domestic production of critical minerals for electric vehicle batteries. They pointed out that it takes years to develop the mining and processing facilities for these minerals. However, [automakers and miners have responded enthusiastically](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/ira-at-1-speed-of-mining-investments-surprises-experts-76685948) to the incentives. Albemarle, Lithium Americas and General Motors have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in domestic mining and battery manufacturing site investments. Ford has announced a $3.5 billion investment in a Michigan battery plant, and Piedmont Lithium is building a lithium hydroxide processing plant in Tennessee. All of these projects have been announced or accelerated since the Inflation Reduction Act was signed.\n\n\nHowever, the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s critics can still point to [the slow pace of clean hydrogen development](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/podcasts/master-of-risk-episode-4). While the act authorized a tax credit for hydrogen producers worth up to $3 per kilogram for clean hydrogen, rules that preclude existing hydrogen producers from buying renewable energy certificates to claim the credit have met with criticism. Only 11 of 115 announced hydrogen projects have drawn funding, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. While the US Treasury Department promised simplified guidance on which projects would qualify for the $3-per-kilogram tax credit, it has missed several deadlines. Meanwhile, hydrogen producers have been active in lobbying Congress to amend the rules to apply to a wider range of projects.\n\n\n[Offshore wind is also lagging expectations](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/ira-at-1-us-boost-to-offshore-wind-imperiled-by-struggling-projects-76971616). While the Inflation Reduction Act established significant incentives for offshore wind \u2014 a 10% domestic content bonus tacked onto a 30% investment tax credit \u2014 the limits placed on those incentives have proved challenging. Qualifying offshore wind projects are required to use 100% domestically made iron and steel in nonmanufactured components, and 20% of the total costs of manufactured components and subcomponents must be mined, produced or manufactured in the US. Despite the slow progress in offshore wind, 18 offshore wind shipbuilding projects and investments are under development in 12 manufacturing facilities and 13 ports. These projects create the capacity to develop more wind projects in the future.\n\n\nToday is **Thursday, August 17, 2023**, and here is today\u2019s essential intelligence.\n\n\n*Written by Nathan Hunt.*\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n#### Economy\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Global Inflation And Growth: What To Watch For In The Upcoming August PMI Surveys**\n\n\n![](/_division_assets/images/articles/daily-update-august-17-2023/economy_aug17.png)\n\n\nThe global economy continued to lose growth momentum at the start of the second half of 2023, underpinned by waning of service sector growth momentum and a deepening manufacturing downturn.

Building upon established relationships with farm owners, Hedonova facilitated growth capital, land expansion, equipment financing, and more to nurture the farm's operations.  \n\u00a0  \nHedonova played a pivotal role in providing a $4 million loan to Wented Agri Trading Limited. The loan supported the farm's multifaceted efforts, including vital reforestation initiatives undertaken in each of the countries it operates within. To secure this investment, Hedonova obtained collateral in the form of the farm's assets in India, with an approximate market value of $12 million.  \n\u00a0  \nWented Agri Trading Limited utilised the investment capital to enhance key components of its operations, including upgrading machinery with advanced carbon dioxide sensors and providing comprehensive training to staff in carbon compliance.  \n  \nUpon the completion of a thorough audit, Wented Agri Trading Limited was granted approximately 260,000 carbon credits, reflecting an approximate value of $9 million. Hedonova successfully sold these valuable credits on the European carbon exchange, effectively capitalising on the growing market demand for sustainable solutions. In this triumphant collaboration, $5.4 million of the realised $9 million profit has been designated to Hedonova, a gross profit of 35%. After expenses and tax, new returns to clients were 18.04%.  \n\u00a0  \nAlexander Cavendish, Hedonova's CEO, enthusiastically expressed the exclusive opportunity, sharing, \"Our valued clients can now engage in a venture that offers compelling returns while promoting their participation in sustainable practices, thus contributing to an ecologically resilient and greener future.\"  \n\u00a0  \nHedonova remains committed to fostering impactful investments that merge sustainability with financial growth, contributing to a brighter and greener future for generations to come.  \n  \n***About Hedonova***  \n*Hedonova is an alternative investment firm specialising in identifying and capitalizing on unique investment opportunities across various sectors.

These credits allow them to compensate for their emissions and have become a significant source of income for companies like electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla.\n\nWithin the European Union Emissions Trading System\u2019s compliance market, the cost of carbon pricing trades in the range of \u20ac80 to \u20ac100 per ton ($87 to $108).\n\nATOME also mentioned that the progress towards making a final investment decision (FID) for the first phase at Villeta is aligned with expectations and is set to be concluded in the last quarter of this year as planned.\n\nRelevant: **[Guyana Sells Carbon Credits For $750 Million To Hess](https://carbonherald.com/guyana-sells-carbon-credits-for-750-million-to-hess/)**\n\nOlivier Mussat, ATOME\u2019s CEO, said that their Phase 1 Villeta project is aligned with sustainable development goals. This includes the creation of local employment opportunities, adding value to Paraguay, and contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture.\n\n\u201cWith increasing climate pressure on the fertilizer sector, the initial analysis of the potential carbon credits generation suggests a potential significant stream of value-added revenue creation,\u201d he also said.\u00a0\n\nATOME\u2019s financial adviser Natixis has issued an [information memorandum](https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/atome-energy---distribution-of-information-memorandum-for-project-financing) that offers details on the project and is an important step toward securing funding at the project level, according to a company statement.\u00a0\n\nAccording to Mussat, in the opinion of ATOME\u2019s directors, the company will produce the most affordable green fertilizer globally by 2025.\u00a0\n\nRead more: **[Iberdrola Launches Nature-Based Carbon Credits Company](https://carbonherald.com/iberdrola-launches-nature-based-carbon-credits-company/)**\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "ATOME Energy's green fertilizer project in Paraguay could generate half a million carbon credits annually and has the potential to yield 12 million credits over 25 years.

Sylvera\u2019s rating expertise complements our pricing and underwriting capabilities, enabling us to deliver tailored carbon insurance solutions.

Credit: Simon Bowie, FlickrCC\nIf you want to get environmental advocates agitated, bring up carbon offsetting. It is among the most hotly debated climate solution efforts, with opinions fanned out on the spectrum from whole-heartedly for, entirely against, and everywhere in between. But what actually is it?\n\n\nOffsetting is the act of counterbalancing harmful emissions one might be responsible for by funding a project that removes the same amount of emissions from the atmosphere, i.e. planting trees to compensate for an airplane flight. Offsets are hooked up to a broader financial system called a \u201ccarbon market,\u201d where investors can buy \u201ccarbon credits\u201d to compensate for their emissions. One credit equals one ton of CO2.\n\n\nThere are two types of carbon markets, one \u201cvoluntary\u201d and one called \u201ccompliance.\u201d Compliance markets are controlled by official policy, and a cap-and-trade system, whereby a government will set a \u201ccap\u201d (a limit) how much CO2 an industry may release, and then divide it into permits, which are either given or sold to companies within that industry. If a company doesn\u2019t use all of its allowance, it can sell the extra to bigger emitters for a profit. Each year, the cap is supposed to get lower and lower, driving the price of polluting up and, in theory, sending companies careening towards renewables and clean energy.\n\n\nThe voluntary system is similar, but it functions outside of government regulation. Companies purchase credits from carbon offsetting projects in order to prove their environmental standards. On paper, this sounds great. But activists do have valid concerns. An investigation into Verra, the world\u2019s leading voluntary carbon credit certifier, found that over 90 percent of its credits were phantom ones with no environmental benefit. So, it is easy to see why some think it is a massive scam.\n\n\n\u201cStop greenwashing!\u201d shouted young climate activist Greta Thunberg at an assembly of experts at the 2021 United Nations Climate Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. The topic? Carbon offsetting. Greenpeace is very vocal on the matter too, seeing it as merely \u201c[t]ree planting window dressing aimed at distracting [us] from ecosystem destruction.\u201d But solid belief in the potential in the market is also valid. Johan Rockstr\u00f6m from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research says that offsetting generates much-needed investments even if it does lack proper regulation. In fact, investments in green spaces and local communities are a major upside to offsetting. By selling credits that maintain natural landscapes, often in developing countries, the carbon markets funnel money into wildlife, and could even eventually reverse the depressing maxim: \u201cOur forests are worth more dead than alive.\u201d\n\n\nAnd what about the carbon that is already in the atmosphere? Naveen Shivalingam, co-founder of Peak 365, a carbon market solutions company, notes that \u201cthe negatives [of the carbon markets] are pretty far reaching. But the fact remains that we have 60 billion tons [of CO2] too many in the atmosphere. Even if the world magically switched to renewables tomorrow, we would still be in a climate disaster in 50 years.\u201d Offsetting projects provide a viable escape route.\n\n\n**CONTACTS**\n\n\n* [Peak 365](https://peak365.co.uk)\n* [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/home)\n* [Is Carbon Offsetting Greenwashing?

The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall.\n\nWithin the cap, operators buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed.\n\nThe limit on the total number of allowances available ensures that they have a value. The price signal incentivizes emission reductions and promotes investment in innovative, low-carbon technologies, whilst trading brings flexibility that ensures emissions are cut where it costs least to do so.\n\n\n> This European directive does have a large impact on the sector and as with any sector we assume there will be a process to figure out the exact structure of this market and how compliance and participation will look like.\n> \n> \n\n\u2026 said Ellen De Vocht, EEX Policy Advisor, in a talk organized by EEX Group which discussed the impact of EU ETS on the shipping industry.\n\nAfter each year, an operator must surrender enough allowances to cover fully its emissions, otherwise heavy fines are imposed. If an installation reduces its emissions, it can keep the spare allowances to cover its future needs or else sell them to another operator that is short of allowances.\n\nRevenues from the sale of allowances in the EU ETS mostly feed into Member States\u2019 budgets. Allowances are also auctioned to supply the funds supporting innovation in low-carbon technologies and the energy transition.\n\n\n> The fewer emissions you blow out into the world, the higher competitive advantage you have because it\u2019s directly linked to these common credits that you have to buy, so you one emission equals a carbon credit, and you can then level out how much that is going to cost you.\n> \n> \n\n\u2026 commented Tjard J\u00fcrgens, Senior Vice President \u2013 Business Development at Zeaborn during the same talk as Ellen De Vocht.\n\nThe EU ETS will concern all ships operating within the EU, regardless of flag state.\n\nTjard J\u00fcrgens also proposed three measures that industry parties can implement in order to comply with the EU ETS. These are as follows:\n\n1. Getting data reporting right is crucial as wrong calculations can result in major loss.\n2. Examine whether the company is ready to enter into the scheme as the process takes time\n3. Find trading partners such as brokers and discuss the decision\n\n**International Maritime Organization\u2019s take** \n\nThe highest level of ambition of the [2023 IMO GHG Strategy, adopted during MEPC 80](https://safety4sea.com/mepc-80-agrees-on-revised-ghg-strategy/), is to limit GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and to reach net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050, taking into account different national circumstances.\n\nIndicative checkpoints to reach net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping:\n\n* To reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20%, striving for 30%, by 2030, compared to 2008; and\n* To reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 70%, striving for 80%, by 2040, compared to 2008\n\nIMO uses two metrics to calculate GHG emissions:\n\n1.

This means that the first annual reporting will be completed in 2023, with initial ratings given in 2024. IMO\u2019s Data Collection System (DCS) data is used to calculate ship\u2019s operational carbon intensity (CII).\n\n**Carbon pricing**\n\nOne major distinction in the EU\u2019s and IMO\u2019s approaches to decarbonization is the issue of price. During the most recent Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 80), industry stakeholders were eager to learn if the IMO would\u00a0proceed with the implementation of a carbon fee.\n\nMany groups and governments express the idea that a [carbon levy\u00a0is the only solution for the shipping industry to meet the IMO\u2019s GHG reduction targets](https://safety4sea.com/ics-ambitious-net-zero-target-can-only-be-achieved-with-a-levy/). For example, the [EU\u2019s proposal to the IMO contained a levy](https://safety4sea.com/eu-proposes-levy-on-shipping-emissions-in-view-of-mepc-80/), the amount of which would be proportional to the quantity of GHG released by the ship in question.\n\n\n> There is a broad support for a global market-based measure by the IMO that should be decided in an international context. In an ideal world, one carbon price is applied to a global sector and everyone in this global sector.\n> \n> \n\n\u2026 noted Ellen De Vocht\n\nFor more information, watch the video below:\n\n\u00a0\n\n[![](https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/login_button6_2-2022_07.png)](http://plus.safety4sea.com/login/)[![](https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/subscribe_button-2019_08.png)](http://www.safety4sea.com/mailing-lists/)Tags: [decarbonization](https://safety4sea.com/tag/decarbonization/)[EU ETS](https://safety4sea.com/tag/eu-ets/)[IMO](https://safety4sea.com/tag/imo/)[regulatory update](https://safety4sea.com/tag/regulatory-update/)[videos](https://safety4sea.com/tag/videos/)", "summaries": [{"summary": "Global organizations are taking steps to limit emissions in the maritime sector to build a more sustainable shipping industry.

And because the EU is the third largest economy in the world, these policies are impacting the entire planet. Here are some of the more recent ones that companies should be aware of.\n\n\nCarbon tax for imported products\n--------------------------------\n\n\nBeginning October 1, 2023, the EU\u2019s newest initiative, the [Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en), will take effect \u2014 representing the first-ever carbon tax for imported goods.\n\n\nAccording to the European Commission, CBAM will \u201cput a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon intensive goods that are entering the EU,\u201d and encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.\n\n\nIn other words, outside goods will be levied a carbon tax if they do not meet EU\u2019s stringent carbon-free requirements.\n\n\nEU\u2019s CBAM targets carbon leakage. This occurs when companies based in the EU move carbon-intensive production abroad to countries with less stringent climate policies, or when EU products get replaced by more carbon-intensive imports.\n\n\nBy confirming that a price has been paid for the embedded carbon emissions generated in the production of certain goods imported into the EU, CBAM aims to ensure the carbon price of imports is equivalent to the carbon price of domestic production, and that the EU\u2019s climate objectives are not undermined.\n\n\nThe tax is designed to be compatible with World Trade Organization rules.\n\n\nInitial industries targeted will be the larger carbon intensive ones such as cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen. Eventually, CBAM aims to capture more than 50% of the emissions in the EU\u2019s Emission Trading System (ETS) covered sectors.\n\n\nThe process is the following:\n\n\n1. EU importers of goods covered by the CBAM will register with national authorities. They can buy CBAM certificates, whose price which will be based on weekly ETS allowances.\n2. The EU importer will declare the emissions embedded in its imports and will report the corresponding numbers of certificates each year.\n3. If importers can prove that a carbon price has already been paid during the production of the imported good, the corresponding amount can be deducted.\n\n\nCompanies should not be concerned about a sudden financial burden. There will be a gradual introduction of CBAM, which aligns with the phase-out of the allocation of free allowances under the EU\u2019s ETS.\n\n\nThe CBAM will enter its transitional phase on October 1, 2023, with the first reporting period for importers ending January 31, 2024.\n\n\nCommon standards\n----------------\n\n\nThe EU is also standardizing sustainability reporting through its new [European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_4043), adopted last month. These \u201ccommon standards\u201d will be required for all companies that fall within the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\n\nCompanies will be expected to take a double materiality approach. This means that businesses must report on both their impact on people and the environment, as well as how social and environmental issues create financial risks and opportunities for them.\n\n\nThere are 12 ESRS standards, covering the full range of sustainability issues. But each has different requirements. For example, ESRS 1 General Requirements sets general principles to be applied when reporting and does not itself set specific disclosure requirements. ESRS 2 General Disclosures, however, specifies essential information to be disclosed irrespective of which sustainability matter is being considered. It should be noted that ESRS 2 is mandatory for all companies under the CSRD scope.\n\n\nAll the other standards and the individual disclosure requirements and datapoints within them are subject to a materiality assessment. A company will report only relevant information and may omit the information in question that is not material for its business model and activity.\n\n\nCompanies should note, however, that disclosure requirements subject to materiality are not voluntary.\n\n\nClimate change has wide-ranging and systemic impacts across the economy. For this reason, if a company decides that climate change is not a material topic, and chooses not to report, it must prove this with a detailed explanation of the conclusions of its materiality assessment.\n\n\nBusinesses will have to apply the rules for the first time in the 2024 financial year, with reports published in 2025.\n\n\nGreen claims\n------------\n\n\nIn March 2023, the Commission adopted a proposal for a [Green Claims initiative](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52023PC0166). The directive aims to stop companies from making misleading claims about environmental merits of their products and services.\n\n\nIn an attempt to prevent greenwashing, the law requires companies to substantiate their environmental claims by:\n\n\n* Relying on recognized scientific evidence and state of the art technical knowledge\n* Demonstrating the significance of impacts, aspects, and performance from a life-cycle perspective\n* Taking into account all significant aspects and impacts to assess the performance\n* Demonstrating whether the claim is accurate for the whole product life cycle or only certain stages\n* Demonstrating that the claim is not equivalent to requirements imposed by law\n* Providing information on whether the product performs environmentally significantly better than what is common practice\n* Identifying whether a positive achievement leads to a significant worsening of another impact\n\n\nThe directive also requires greenhouse gas offsets to be reported in a transparent manner. Accurate primary or secondary information must be included.  \n\n  \n\nEven if your company is not located in the EU, there may be direct or indirect consequences of present and future EU climate change regulations on your business.\n\n ", "summaries": [{"summary": "The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will impose a carbon tax on imported goods starting from October 1, 2023.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The CBAM aims to ensure a fair price for carbon emissions and prevent carbon leakage."}, {"summary": "The EU has introduced European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) for companies falling within the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The ESRS will standardize sustainability reporting and provide consistent guidelines for companies."}, {"summary": "The Commission has proposed the Green Claims initiative to prevent misleading environmental claims by companies.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The directive aims to combat greenwashing and requires companies to substantiate their claims."}, {"summary": "Companies outside the EU may still be affected by EU climate change regulations.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Some regulations may have direct or indirect consequences on businesses outside the EU."}], "semantic_commentary": "Relevant: CBAM, ESRS, Green Claims, EU regulations affect non-EU companies.", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is a system/policy aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, specifically the EU introducing European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the Commission proposing the Green Claims initiative."}]}, {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zealand-pushes-start-farm-emissions-010000176.html", "title": "New Zealand Pushes Start of Farm Emissions Tax to Late 2025", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand has pushed back the start of taxes on agricultural greenhouse gas emissions to give farmers more time to adjust to the requirements.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n* [China Evergrande Group Files Chapter 15 Bankruptcy in New York](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/china-evergrande-files-chapter-15-bankruptcy-in-new-york?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n* [\u2018Poor Man\u2019s Cocaine\u2019 Costing $3 a Pill Threatens to Proliferate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/-3-narcotic-pill-sold-in-the-gulf-worries-european-officials?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n* [Goldman Plans Hiring Spree to Fix Lapses After Increased Fed Scrutiny](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/goldman-sachs-facing-increased-fed-scrutiny-starts-hiring-binge?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n* [Niger Soldiers Killed in Attacks by Armed Group, Ecowas Says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-16/niger-soldiers-killed-in-attacks-by-armed-group-ecowas-says?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n* [China\u2019s Hidden Financial Dangers Erupt With Shadow Bank Crisis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-18/china-s-hidden-financial-dangers-erupt-with-shadow-bank-crisis?utm_campaign=bn&utm_medium=distro&utm_source=yahooUS)\n\nEmissions pricing will now start in the fourth quarter of 2025, rather than the first quarter, Agriculture Minister Damien O\u2019Connor said Friday in Wellington.

[GAO YUWEN/FOR CHINA DAILY] \n \n\nGreater efforts are needed to advance the technologies of market entities such as solar and wind energy generators, electricity storage facilities and virtual power plants to accelerate their transition into a new power system, experts said.\n\n\nMeanwhile, mechanisms that allow electricity users to take responsibility for their carbon emissions should also be introduced, they said.\n\n\nCompared to traditional methods, the new system envisages a move away from reliance on fossil fuels to one based on new energy sources to generate electricity.\n\n\nIt involves gradually increasing the proportion of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, in electricity generation.\n\n\nAt the same time, an upgrade to the transmission grid will ensure that the new power system will efficiently harness new energy sources and facilitate a smoother integration of various power loads, as well as enhance electrification use, the experts said, adding that these are essential to achieving China's green goals.\n\n\nZhang Jieqing, China program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the current power system is hampered by the large-scale integration of power generated from renewable energy sources and extreme weather.\n\n\n\"The evolving supply-demand dynamic is making power system operations more complex, with issues arising from intermittent new energy sources, insufficient system flexibility, and heightened difficulties in load control. Urgent low-carbon transformation of the power system is imperative to combat climate change,\" Zhang said.\n\n\nShe said the power sector is a major carbon emitter with a 2.6 percent year-on-year growth in 2022, despite a slight slowdown in emissions growth.\n\n\nThe concept of a new power system was first introduced in March 2021.\n\n\nIn the first half of this year, the National Energy Administration released a blue book on the development of the new power system, specifying the framework and key tasks for its establishment with an emphasis on technological and systematic innovation.\n\n\nAs renewable energy experiences a leap in development \u2014 transitioning from a supplementary to a primary energy source for newly installed power generation facilities \u2014 it is crucial to enhance the resilience, flexibility, and reliability of the new power system, said Shi Yubo, chairman of the China Energy Research Society. The system should involve market entities like solar and wind power generators, energy storage and virtual power plants for stable operations, Shi added.\n\n\nChina has comprehensively accelerated the development of the new power system, said Yang Kun, executive vice-chairman of the China Electricity Council.\n\n\nThe country has become a global leader in wind and solar installations, its electrification rates are ranked among the top in the world, and its energy market vitality has improved significantly, Yang said.\n\n\n\"Meanwhile, challenges remain, such as demanding breakthroughs in key technologies and the improvement of cost adjustment mechanisms. It is critical to improve relevant mechanisms, promote synergy between the electricity market and the carbon market, and coordinate between power system standards and digital applications,\" Yang added.\n\n\nAccording to data from the NEA, China's installed renewable energy capacity reached 1.32 billion kilowatts as of June, a year-on-year increase of 18.2 percent, surpassing coal-fired power and accounting for 48.8 percent of the country's total.\n\n\nWind and solar power generation have grown rapidly.\n\n\nIn the first half, renewable energy generation reached 1.34 trillion kilowatt-hours, of which wind and solar power contributed 729.1 billion kWh, representing a 23.5 percent yearly increase.\n\n\nJiang Yi, director of Tsinghua University's Building Energy Research Center, proposed the establishment of a carbon emissions responsibility mechanism to allow more power users to participate in the management of carbon emissions.\n\n\nJiang said there are abundant flexible power sources on the user side, such as electric vehicles, buildings, and industrial power loads. However, they cannot directly connect to the grid and are therefore, hard to manage.\n\n\nA carbon emission responsibility mechanism can track their carbon footprint, specify what they would have to pay in carbon trading markets \u2014 just like power generators and grids do \u2014 and facilitate the low-carbon development of all entities involved in the new power system, Jiang said.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Experts emphasize the need to advance technologies of solar and wind energy generators, electricity storage facilities, and virtual power plants to transition into a new power system.

This will then rise incrementally each year to 80% for cars and 70% for vans in 2030, and 100% for both by 2035.\n\n\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) plans to put the ZEV mandate rules to a vote in Parliament, according to a report in [The i newspaper](https://inews.co.uk/news/rishi-sunak-offer-mps-vote-electric-cars-tory-anger-net-zero-2552098).\n\n\nVehicle makers that fail to achieve the ZEV mandate sales targets will be subject to fines, with a system of proposed flexibilities and credits to support those that sell a low volume of electric vehicles (EVs).\n\n\nResearch from New Automotive shows that 32 car manufacturers would collectively be 44,000 credits short of meeting these targets, if the ZEV mandate had been in force over the last 12 months.\n\n\nIf a company misses the target, it will be made to pay the Government \u00a315,000 for every vehicle that doesn't comply. This totals \u00a3660m in borrowing costs, according to New Automotive.\n\n\nFears have already been raised that the proposals [could create another vehicle supply crisis](https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2023/04/25/fears-zev-mandate-could-impact-uk-new-van-supply), if manufacturers decide to cap the number of non-electric vehicles they sell.\n\n\nA number of [leading fleet operators are supportive of the targets](https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/latest-fleet-news/electric-fleet-news/2023/05/24/leading-fleets-call-for-ambitious-targets-for-zev-mandate), however.\n\n\nThe Government has been consulting on the ZEV mandate, since it [published a proposal of how the scheme could work](https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/latest-fleet-news/electric-fleet-news/2022/04/07/government-launches-consultation-on-zero-emission-vehicle-mandate), in April.\n\n\nThe proposals fail to define which vehicles will be permitted for sale between 2030 and 2035, which the Government has stated must have \u2018significant zero emission capability\u2019.\n\n\nThe consultation also states that only true \u201czero carbon\u201d technologies will be permitted post 2035, which could rule out synthetic e-fuels as an alternative to electrification or hydrogen.\n\n\nMike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said: \u201cWe want regulation that gives consumers choice and affordability, and enables manufacturers to transition sustainably and competitively.\n\n\n\u201cWhile the proposals rightly reflect the sector\u2019s diversity, late publication and lack of regulatory certainty make product planning near impossible, and the continued lack of clarity as to what technologies will be permitted beyond 2030 undermines attempts to secure investment.\u201d\n\n\n#### **Which manufacturers face the biggest penalties?**\n\n\nIn the first half of 2023, 16% of all new cars sold were electric. Only 11 car makers exceeded the proposed 22% target for EV sales, however, and a third of all the EVs sold in the UK between January and July came from just three brands.\n\n\nManufacturers such as BYD, GWM ORA, MG, Polestar, Smart and Tesla are significantly ahead of the target, due to their model ranges being mainly or entirely electric.\n\n\nBMW, Cupra, Jaguar, Porsche and Volvo are also close-to or already achieving the target, based on current registration figures.\n\n\n**Brands with the highest proportion of\u00a0EV sales in H1 2023:**\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Manufacturer** | **EV %** |\n| BYD | 100% |\n| Cupra | 26% |\n| Genesis | 76% |\n| Jaguar | 28% |\n| MG | 38% |\n| Polestar | 100% |\n| Porsche | 27% |\n| Tesla | 100% |\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBrands with no EVs include Alfa Romeo, Dacia and Seat, but they are all part of larger automotive groups and may benefit from credit sharing arrangements.\n\n\nJapanese brands Honda, Mazda, and Toyota Lexus face a particular challenge, as the bulk of their sales come from internal combustion engine (ICE) models.\n\n\nFord, equally, has a strong ICE mix, with EVs making up just 2% of its registrations in the first half of 2023.\n\n\nTim Slatter, Ford Motor Company chair, said Ford supports the ZEV mandate but has raised concerns that car makers will also face [increased trade tariffs from next year, as a result of changes to the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).](https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/latest-fleet-news/electric-fleet-news/2022/12/09/electric-vehicle-price-rise-threat-from-eu-tariffs)\n\n\nHe added: \u201cIntroducing EV tariffs at the same time will undermine the mandate and slow the growing EV trend.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cToday the industry does not have sufficient locally-sourced batteries and components to meet demand.\u00a0 Tightening trade rules at this point risks undermining the switch to EVs with tariffs and adding pointless cost to customers wanting to go green. Manufacturers who have invested most early in the transition will be hardest hit by tariffs as combustion engine vehicles will continue to move tariff-free.\u201d\n\n\nFord is calling for current trade requirements to be extended to 2027, to allow time for the battery supply chain to develop in UK-EU and to meet EV demand.\u00a0\n\n\n**Brands with the lowest proporton of EV sales in H1 2023:**\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Manufacturer** | **EV %** |\n| Alfa Romeo | 0% |\n| Dacia | 0% |\n| Honda | 1% |\n| Jeep | 1% |\n| Land Rover | 0% |\n| Lexus | 7% |\n| Mazda | 2% |\n| Seat | 0% |\n| Toyota | 1% |\n\n\nStellantis brands Citroen, Peugeot and Vauxhall all have multiple EVs in their respective line ups, yet the group\u2019s EV registrations currently make up only 15% of its total sales.\n\n\nA Stellantis spokesperson told Fleet News: \u201cWe welcome the flexibilities for banking, borrowing, trading and pooling and we welcome closed pooling being permitted.\u201d\n\n\nThey added: \u201cNo decision has been made on the specifics of our strategy to date.\u201d\n\n\nStellantis expects to see growth in the EV market for all its brands. \u00a0By next year Vauxhall will offer an electric variant of every car it sells, while Jeep is about to start selling its first EV in the UK.\n\n\nToyota Lexus declined to comment on the ZEV mandate, but [in a recent interview with Fleet News](https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/manufacturer-news/2023/07/17/toyota-lexus-develops-fleet-offering-with-electric-product-in-the-pipeline), Neil Broad, general manager of One Toyota Fleet Services, acknowledged that the brand faces a challenge in the short-term.\u00a0\n\n\n#### **Fleet buyers drive the majority of EV sales**\n\n\nDeeper analysis of UK new car registration figures highlight the importance of the fleet sector in the rollout of new EVs.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the first half of 2023, 60% of EVs were sold into the true fleet market while less than a quarter went to private buyers.\n\n\nFor premium brands, the fleet sector is an even bigger driver of EV sales and accounts for around three in every four registrations.\n\n\n", "summaries":
