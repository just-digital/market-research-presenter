Twenty-seven direct air capture plants have been commissioned worldwide, capturing under 10,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, [according](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage/direct-air-capture) to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

He said that \u201cscenarios show that even with mind-boggling amounts of carbon dioxide removal, coal, oil and gas drop rapidly\u201d.\n\n\nThe IEA [has said](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/05/18/iea-end-fossil-fuel-expansion-now-net-zero-energy-emissions-2050/) that, if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5C, there should be no new fossil fuel production facilities.

That makes it cheaper for them to get more oil out of the ground.\n\n\n\n> [**Mainstream economists** accused of playing down climate threat](https://climatechangenews.com/2023/08/08/economics-climate-threat-models/)\n> \n> \n\n\nShe explained to the podcast that carbon sucked from the atmosphere is \u201ca long term source, a non-declining source of CO2 and it could be at lower cost if we could get the facilities designed correctly and optimise over time \u2013 so that\u2019s what started us down the path\u201d.\n\n\nOn top of the two projects already selected, the energy department announced [19 projects](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/project-selections-foa-2735-regional-direct-air-capture-hubs-topic-area-1-feasibility-and) that it was talking to regarding funding.\n\n\nOil company Chevron were among those with projects chosen, as well as universities, engineering companies and green campaign groups like the Rocky Mountain Institute.\n\n\n*This article was updated on 16 August as it originally incorrectly said that a company called Fervo was an oil company.

That law, called the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, funnels hundreds of billions of dollars into clean-energy tax credits for power producers, rebates for electric vehicles and heat pumps, and other emissions-fighting measures. After decades of inaction on climate change, the IRA marked a new era in the nation\u2019s belated quest to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\nBut the fight over the law isn\u2019t over yet. Recent polling shows that a whopping [7 in 10 Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/07/biden-white-house-climate-policy/) say they haven\u2019t heard anything substantial about the IRA, an apparent indication that most voters aren\u2019t thinking about it as the 2024 presidential election approaches. Furthermore, even though most new investment from the bill [has flowed to red states](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/13/biden-inflation-reduction-act-climate-states-00110940), many Republican leaders are [pushing back against it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-11/desantis-says-no-thanks-to-377-million-in-federal-energy-funds?sref=wINQCNXe).\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s also far from guaranteed that the law will work as planned. The bill consists of more than a hundred different provisions, many of them involving complicated changes to the tax code, and some of those provisions are already hitting snags. Even if everything goes exactly right, experts believe the bill will [still leave the U.S. short of President Biden\u2019s stated climate goals](https://grist.org/politics/one-year-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-is-working-kind-of/). In all likelihood, the U.S. will need to pass more climate legislation to achieve those goals. The public\u2019s appetite for that will hinge on the success of the IRA.\u00a0\n\n\nThe man tasked with ensuring the bill\u2019s success is John Podesta, a veteran political strategist who served as a senior White House official under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama but became something close to a household name only after then-presidential candidate [Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were leaked](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-wikileaks.html).

[Here's How](https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist)\n\n\n\n\n**A.** Look, this is a multifaceted bill. There\u2019s 135 separate programs in the bill. A good deal of the work is being done through the tax code. So I spent a lot of time working with the Department of Treasury, the Department of Energy, and other related agencies \u2014 like the Labor Department on some of the provisions \u2014 just trying to get guidance out so that the private sector has clarity about how it can take advantage of the support for clean energy and clean technology that\u2019s in the bill.\n\n\nOne of the interesting elements of the bill was: it\u2019s just not a power-sector-only bill. It attacks all the emitting sectors: power, transportation, buildings, forestry and agriculture, as well as manufacturing and infrastructure. So given the sweep of that, there\u2019s a lot of detail that needs to be worked out. And in addition to talking to a lot of companies who are trying to plan for the future and raising issues about how to interpret various provisions of the bill, I spent a lot of time talking to my colleagues in other federal agencies to make sure that we get clarity. And then there\u2019s $100 billion worth of grants that we\u2019re working to move quickly and expeditiously. The money is available for some period of time, but we want to get it moving upfront because the need is so great.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q. A recent [Washington Post poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/07/biden-white-house-climate-policy/) found that 7 in 10 Americans don\u2019t know very much about the IRA at all. What does it tell you about the bill? Are there efforts underway to mitigate that?**\n\n\n**A.** It\u2019s really natural in today\u2019s political environment that people don\u2019t pay attention to legislation, particularly when you\u2019re talking about specific legislative names. They don\u2019t really relate to it on that basis. But they do relate to projects, jobs, companies coming into their communities, and I think the general level of public support remains high across the political spectrum.\u00a0\n\n\nI\u2019m a veteran of the Affordable Care Act, and the difference between the ACA and the clean energy investments in the IRA is that the Affordable Care Act, by the time it actually passed, was kind of unpopular. It took a while for people to feel the benefits of it. Now, notwithstanding Republican efforts, they can\u2019t tear it away, because people are really seeing its benefits. I think the same thing will be true of the Inflation Reduction Act. Whether people relate to the name of the bill or not, you know, that\u2019s for others to judge.\n\n\n**Q.** **You mention there\u2019s a lot of corporate investment happening right now, like big manufacturing investments in electric vehicles, and it\u2019s true that Americans will notice if there\u2019s a new factory in their town. But the consumer-facing side of the bill does rely on people knowing they can claim a tax credit for a home retrofit or a heat pump. Are you concerned that the lack of awareness is going to hinder the uptake of those consumer credits?**\n\n\n**A.** I think we\u2019re working hard to make sure it doesn\u2019t, and we need consumer-facing businesses to help people know what they can take advantage of. The Department of Energy, for instance, has made a series of grants to upgrade the training of people who are in the HVAC business, so that they know the benefits that are available to consumers. You mention heat pumps \u2014 generally those are point-of-failure purchases, so you\u2019ve got to know about the availability. It\u2019s a little easier on the auto side, because the auto companies are all over this movement toward electrification: They\u2019re advertising heavily on it, they\u2019ve committed very substantial capital to it. It\u2019s important for us, as the government, to be out there talking about the benefits, but some of this is neighbor to neighbor.\n\n\n**Q. Four Republican states have said that they won\u2019t take IRA money, even though most of the benefits of this bill are actually going to red states. Does that hold up the implementation? How much does that make your job harder?**\u00a0\n\n\n**A.** I mean, it\u2019s an unusual decision to refuse to support at a time when virtually every part of the country is feeling some kind of extreme weather. You don\u2019t have to go to the deadliest fire in the last hundred years of American history, in Maui. It was over 110 degrees for 31 straight days in Phoenix. The floods in upstate New York, in Vermont, and the extreme heat in the south and the Southeast. So, you know, putting your head in the sand and ignoring the reality, and ignoring the science, and ignoring everybody\u2019s lived experience to make a statement that everything has to be a culture war issue, is sort of unusual.\n\n\nFour [states] turned down the planning money, but 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico took it. So I feel like we\u2019re moving forward. I spend time talking to Republican governors, and unlike their counterparts in the House of Representatives, they\u2019re anxious to attract the investment. I saw Governor [Kevin] Stitt from Oklahoma, and he just landed a big solar plant in Oklahoma. And all he wanted to talk about is why the Volkswagen Battery plant got away from him and what more he could do to attract more clean investment.\n\n\n**Q.** **You\u2019re drawing a distinction between Republican governors, who obviously want to land these investments, and the House GOP \u2014 many members of which have said that they want to repeal the IRA. What happens if come 2025, the credits are rescinded or limited? How damaging do you think that would be for the decarbonization process in the U.S.?**\n\n\n**A.** This is the most significant piece of our ability to hit the pledge that President Biden made in 2021 to cut our greenhouse gas emissions between 50 and 52 percent by 2030. Around 40 to 42 percent of that is a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, and that depends on tax credits being available through the rest of this decade. House Republicans have tried on several occasions to repeal large parts of it, but I think the more people see and feel the benefits, the harder and harder that will be. These companies are investing [in renewable energy] because the structure of this law gives them certainty. Rather than the on-off, on-off [structure] of previous renewable credits, they have ten years of certainty. I think those investments will prove to be durable, and I don\u2019t know that Republicans, even if they had more power, would walk away from that.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q.** **A lot of the investments that you\u2019re talking about so far have gone to red states. In particular, a lot have gone to right-to-work states and states with lower prevailing wages. Is that outcome problematic for an administration that has prioritized union jobs?**\n\n\n**A.** Because [the legislation is] built into the tax code, companies are going to make individual choices. I think what we expect from them is to give everywhere a fair shot, and we want to push them towards labor neutrality. We saw a bit of success in the Blue Bird [electric school bus factory] [being organized in Georgia](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/26/23738451/blue-bird-electric-yellow-school-bus-factory-georgia). There\u2019ll be places where people want to take advantage of whatever state is offering tax breaks or lower personnel costs. But I think for the most part, we\u2019re seeing investment all over. And obviously our voice is critical, and we\u2019re trying to make sure that it\u2019s loud and in support of the right to organize.\n\n\n**Q.** **We have to ask you about [permitting reform](https://grist.org/climate-energy/transmission-impossible-are-democrats-punting-on-permitting-reform/), just because it seems like so much of this really hinges on that. Recent negotiations around permitting reform have sputtered out, and permitting reform has become one of those things that keeps coming back and keeps dying. Is that absolutely essential to the longevity of the IRA?**\n\n\n**A.** Cutting the time to permit and fixing the interconnection queue problems is absolutely essential. It would be great if we get some legislative support for that. But I think we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure these projects are indeed considered and permitted, and that any real concerns \u2014 whether those are environmental justice or environmental concerns \u2014 are considered early at the front end so that we can mitigate those concerns and move projects forward.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is my third White House, and my fourth presidential administration, and we\u2019re doing something I\u2019ve never seen before, which is Cabinet-level, White House-coordinated attention to permitting at a policy level and at an individual project level. We meet regularly at a Cabinet level to try to consider both: Are there things we can do to cut time and ensure quality in the permitting process at a policy level? And then going directly to the individual projects and saying: Why are they hung up? Can we find a way to fix that?\n\n\nI think when you have political accountability, starting from the [resident, saying, \u201cI want this done,\u201d things will happen. And I think they are happening. But could we use a lot from our friends on Capitol Hill? Yes, we could.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q.** **I\u2019m sure you know that local governments, especially in the Midwest, are putting up pretty significant opposition to the siting of wind and solar facilities. There\u2019s one report that [found 228 new laws in 35 states](https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/opposition-renewable-energy-facilities-united-states-may-2023-edition) that make it more difficult to build these projects. To what extent do you think the local opposition represents a challenge to the rollout of the IRA? And can you even do anything about that at the federal level to make it easier to site these facilities?**\n\n\n**A.** I think that we have a role in establishing the benefits of clean power: the economic benefits, the health benefits. But I think at the end of the day, some of those decisions are localized. There\u2019s a significant amount of money being spent to slow the buildout, that\u2019s coming from a variety of sources and people who oppose taking action to deal with climate change. We can\u2019t directly get involved, but we can encourage other voices to be involved in those local fights. This is going to be a little bit of hand-to-hand combat in the near term. People [from local political organizations] will come to us and say, \u201ccan\u2019t you make [decarbonization] go faster?\u201d And I think it\u2019s a fair point for us to say, \u201cYou know, you have local members. What are you doing about this?\u201d\n\n\n**Q.** **There\u2019s been a lot of debate over a lot of the provisions in the bill, including [green hydrogen](https://grist.org/energy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-ira/), [carbon capture](https://grist.org/technology/will-the-inflation-reduction-act-jumpstart-carbon-capture-45q/), and [biogas](https://grist.org/agriculture/biogas-boom-ira-incentives/), with many environmental justice advocates raising concerns about them. I just wonder how you think about balancing a strong momentum for decarbonization with the concerns of the communities that are going to be near this infrastructure.**\n\n\n**A.** In our view, it\u2019s going to be essential that we find a pathway for truly green hydrogen, because it\u2019s going to be a very important element of decarbonizing the industrial sector. It\u2019s also critical in terms of both air and marine fuels. But I think we also have to listen to the communities that are voicing concerns about it. There\u2019s also going to have to be a significant amount of carbon removal in order to hit the net-zero goals by mid-century, and some of that\u2019s going to happen by direct removal of carbon from the atmosphere. I think that it\u2019s incumbent in this decade that we begin to create strong environmental protections for the technologies that are going to be required if we\u2019re going to stabilize the atmosphere. We\u2019re trying our best to make sure we\u2019re listening to people and that we make good decisions.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q.** **A lot of the consumer-focused energy efficiency programs, plus the heat pumps and solar panels, require pretty significant upfront investment. Are you concerned that the takeup will lag behind in low-income communities? Even though you get a tax credit, it\u2019s still going to be out of reach for a lot of people.**\n\n\n**A.** We\u2019re trying to solve for that, particularly on the rebate side. If you\u2019re a low-income household you can switch out to a heat pump for a very, very low cost \u2014 in some cases free \u2014 but that has to be done at the point of sale, and we need to work with states to implement the credits so that there isn\u2019t a big upfront capital expenditure. It\u2019s a little bit different in terms of taking advantage of the tax rebate advantages, where you get that money back on your tax return, but we\u2019re trying as much as we can to make that consumer-friendly, including working with the auto companies and dealers.\n\n\n**Q.** **It sounds like you\u2019re kind of saying that, in addition to state and local governments, you guys need help from like, Lowe\u2019s, or something, to make this bill work.**\n\n\n**A.** I think that\u2019s where people get a lot of their information from, particularly in the home retrofitting area, as it relates to insulation for windows and doors and induction stoves. Those credits are generous, but people have to know about them. And so we\u2019re trying to work with individuals in the install community and with home improvement people to do that.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q. On the home improvement front, have you personally benefited from any of the provisions in the IRA?**\n\n\n**A.** Well, I could have, but I did it earlier. I was an early adopter of solar. I haven\u2019t replaced my furnace yet, but when I do, I\u2019ll get a heat pump.\n\n\n*Tik Root contributed reporting to this story.*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which invests heavily in clean-energy initiatives, is facing challenges as many Americans are unaware of the law and some Republican leaders oppose it.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article presents both positive and negative aspects of the law's implementation and public perception."}, {"summary": "John Podesta, the key figure in implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, discusses the various aspects of the law and efforts to promote awareness and support for it.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The interview provides information without explicitly expressing a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Major efforts are being made to clarify the provisions of the law and ensure that businesses and consumers are aware of the benefits and opportunities available.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The focus on providing clarity and guidance to businesses and consumers demonstrates a proactive approach to promoting the law's benefits."}, {"summary": "While a lack of awareness about the law is a challenge, there is optimism that its benefits will eventually become evident, similar to the Affordable Care Act.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Drawing a comparison to the Affordable Care Act, which gained public support over time, suggests a positive outlook for the Inflation Reduction Act."}, {"summary": "Republican opposition and refusal by some states to accept IRA funds pose hurdles to the law's implementation, but overall progress is still being made across the country.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Republican opposition and state refusals are highlighted as challenges to the law's implementation."}, {"summary": "The IRA is a crucial component of the US's decarbonization efforts and its long-term success will heavily depend on continued political support.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The IRA is described as a significant piece of legislation in achieving decarbonization goals, suggesting a positive view of its potential impact."}, {"summary": "Efforts are being made to ensure that the benefits of the law are spread evenly and that labor rights are protected in the clean energy sector.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The emphasis on fairness, labor neutrality, and protecting workers' rights suggests a positive approach to implementing the law."}, {"summary": "Streamlining the permitting process for renewable energy projects is crucial but faces challenges, and support from Congress would be helpful.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The concern about permitting reform is presented without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "Local opposition to wind and solar projects and concerns about environmental justice require a balanced approach to ensure the success of clean energy initiatives.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The focus on balancing decarbonization momentum with community concerns demonstrates a neutral and balanced perspective."}, {"summary": "Efforts are being made to address accessibility and equity concerns to ensure that low-income communities can benefit from the law's energy efficiency programs.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article highlights efforts to address accessibility and equity concerns, indicating a positive intent to support low-income communities."}], "semantic_commentary": "President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act supports clean energy initiatives.\n", "sentiment_score": 0.4, "classifications": [{"category": "category_o1", "reason": "The article is not related to carbon.

Both are the subject of increasing interest from investment firms.\n\n\nFor example, Pimco features a small allocation to carbon credits in its Pimco Commodity Real Return\u00a0[PCRIX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/pcrix/quote), and KraneShares offers KraneShares Global Carbon Offset ETF\u00a0[KSET](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/report/etf/performance.aspx?t=0P0001O799&lang=en-CA). Both funds argue investments in carbon may allow ordinary investors to benefit financially from decarbonisation efforts.\n\n\nEven so, carbon credits and carbon offsets are fundamentally different, with implications for investors seeking to understand how these instruments work in practice.\n\n\nIt starts with the philosophical problems that each security is trying to tackle. Carbon offsets are designed to help consumers counteract the impact of expected or past emissions.\n\n\nCarbon credits, meanwhile, make it more expensive for companies in regulated industries to pollute by charging them per unit of carbon they emit, which has the effect of disincentivizing future emissions.\n\n\nKey Differences Between Carbon Credits and Carbon Offsets\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![A table comparing and contrasting carbon credits and carbon offsets.](https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/FjoTXCsjra6MWiaIJhi9XYjslGM=/1600x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/LPP4YRRCJJF4JDIY3Z63NII6UU.png)\n\n\nAnother way to think about it is that carbon offsets are not unlike the\u00a0[indulgences of medieval Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence), in the sense that people buy them in order to atone for their environmental sins. Meanwhile, carbon credits are more like a toll on an expressway: A government may actually require companies to pay in order to emit, and carbon credits are the fare they pay for the right to do so.\n\n\nHow Does Carbon Pricing Work?\n-----------------------------\n\n\nFundamentally, carbon offsets and carbon credits answer two different questions. Offsets serve as a proxy for how much people are\u00a0*willing*\u00a0to pay to defray the environmental cost of their activities. Meanwhile, carbon credits address the question of how much businesses are\u00a0*able*\u00a0to pay to keep operating.\n\n\nCarbon offsets measure people's (and companies') willingness to pay for their own personal carbon footprint by pricing the cost of offsetting activities. These offsetting activities fall into two categories: avoidance, which can happen through things like stripping methane from a landfill, or removal, which generally happens through planting trees. Because offsetting activities differ depending on the program, carbon offsets themselves are heterogeneous, and prices tend to vary based on the activity they finance and the quality of the program.\n\n\nMeanwhile, carbon credits track companies' ability to pay for their operations if their emissions exceed preset limits. Because participation is required by law in most cases, the market for carbon credits is much bigger than the market for carbon offsets. This holds true in spite of the fact that offsets are more well-known. \n\n\nWhy is this? Certain businesses have to purchase carbon credits, whereas in most cases the choice to purchase an offset is purely voluntary. Consequently, according to the World Bank, carbon credits regulate around 18% of the world\u2019s emissions, while carbon offsets track far less than 1%.  \n\n\n\nCarbon Credits Market Dwarfs Carbon Offsets\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n![A graph displaying the amount of carbon represented by the carbon credit market as opposed to the carbon offset market.](https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/0mQVR9oju931djM_XnZ-rsZicOc=/1600x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/NBARW5FB4RFQFBXBMX5QGFKH7I.png)\n\n\nParticipation in the carbon credit markets is enforced through a special type of program called a \"cap-and-trade\" programme. The cap-and-trade programme mandates that businesses in specified sectors keep carbon emissions under a particular ceiling, called a \"cap.\" Firms that pollute less than their limit can \"trade\" their excess carbon on the open market. A carbon credit is the security that is created when a company opts to trade its extra carbon. The European Union has the oldest and largest market, but other places like California and China have them, too.\n\n\nMore Importantly,\u00a0*Does*\u00a0Carbon Pricing Work?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nDespite the depth and sophistication of these markets, there is still a lot of daylight between what carbon pricing programs aim to do and what they can feasibly accomplish.\n\n\nWhile awareness of carbon offsets has increased in recent years, participation in carbon offsetting remains\u00a0[muted](https://www.morningstar.com/sustainable-investing/when-it-comes-air-travel-sustainability-flyers-arent-walking-walk). The biggest audience for carbon offsets today is consumers, and for consumers other considerations like price and convenience tend to outweigh the environmental impact of the purchase they\u2019re about to make.\n\n\nThe chief issue plaguing cap-and-trade programs is that governments set the annual emissions caps a few years in advance. In doing so, regulators project how much they expect certain sectors will pollute in a given year. Our research finds most of these covered sectors are reducing emissions faster than government forecasts, which is a good thing. But when companies beat expectations, it leads to a glut of credits on the market, and that means carbon is cheap to trade.\n\n\nIn fact, carbon-linked securities don't charge enough of an economic penalty to directly assist in meeting climate agreements. Economists suggest that the price of carbon needed to meet the\u00a0[Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement)\u00a0is somewhere above $50 per tonne. As of 2023, no carbon offsets command a premium that high, and just four carbon credits across the 36 markets that we cover cost more than that.\n\n\nCarbon Credits Charge More Per Tonne of Carbon\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n![A bar chart showing the difference in prices between carbon offsets and carbon credits.](https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/a2xgg8ap44YuzRDLSIS2IBIo9P0=/1600x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/P4X3WCEDNREJLKPA5GB6HUM6SQ.png)\n\n\nWhat Are the Takeaways For Investors?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nAlthough they are very different, what carbon credits and offsets do have in common is neither carbon offsets nor carbon credits charge a price that could be considered punitive, and there\u2019s no guarantee that they ever will. Proponents of an allocation to carbon-linked securities argue that carbon securities are a \"sure thing\" because, conceptually, the price of carbon\u00a0*has*\u00a0to rise in order to meet climate agreements.\u00a0\n\n\nBut this conclusion rests on the assumption that the price of carbon\u00a0*can*\u00a0rise.\n\n\nFor carbon offsets, that assumption can only hold true if people (and companies) have the appetite and resources to follow through on their self-imposed commitments. For carbon credits, a similar principle applies, but it's a question of political willpower: for these programmes to produce consistent price signals, governments need to set the right standard and stick to it even when it's unpopular.\n\n\nOur research finds that, in most cases, regulators are a little better at it than individuals and companies, but not much. The sectors regulated under cap-and-trade programs have generally cut emissions faster than government forecasts, resulting in cheap carbon[.](https://morningstar.arcpublishing.com/composer/#_msocom_3)\n\n\nCarbon offsets and carbon credits obey fundamentally different principles. Importantly, carbon credits are creatures of regulation, and regulators can create a market and scale it much faster than individuals can. However, it also means that the price of carbon credits depends on the effectiveness of regulators at following through on their aims once those markets go live. Ultimately, though, investors' success in either security depends on the outcomes of carbon markets rather than the intrinsic value of carbon itself.\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Carbon offsets and carbon credits are two different instruments with implications for investors.

solid, despite an anticipated decrease from previous year, and confirm that the changes that we have made in recent years have been successful. EBITDA amounted to EUR 34.3 million, down from EUR 44.8 million in the same period last year which was a record second quarter. The streamlining measures that were taken in 2019-2020, followed by implementation of agile revenue management, improved our business model and created a basis for sustaining healthy profitability in our extensive operations internationally. On the other hand, in the last twelve months we have experienced a swift change in the global shipping market, where freight rates decreased substantially before stabilizing at current level, after the extraordinary rate increases driven by the supply chain disruptions of the Covid period, mainly affecting our international forwarding operations as well as the Trans-Atlantic liner services. This change in global environment has reduced the overall cost of transportation for our customers which is positive.\n\nOur liner services delivered sound results in the quarter, despite a slight decrease in volume. Import to Iceland has remained strong on back of a robust economy while export volume was on a lower level than last year, due to various external factors such as lower salmon production, less fishing activity and reduced industrial output. We are pleased with the outcome in Faroe Islands where activity has been on a good level for the better part of the year despite reduced output of farmed salmon. Our Trans-Atlantic services were affected by the global market conditions where we saw rates decline sharply and volume decrease from previous year while the US economy cooled down and international shipping lines shifted capacity from Asian trade lanes over to the Trans-Atlantic routes. Eimskip\u2019s international forwarding services performed quite well in the quarter, despite an anticipated decrease driven by the change in the global market conditions and there was a slight decrease in volume while margins were on a strong level.\n\nThe shipping industry will be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as of 2024. The purpose and goals of the regulation play an important role when it comes to reducing emissions from the industry. We have been preparing for this regulation for some time now, in order to reduce emissions and mitigate the impact it will inevitably have on cost of transportation. In recent years we have taken various initiatives to reduce emissions from our operations, such as investing in larger and newer vessels which are more fuel-efficient than the older vessels replaced, electrification of harbor cranes, the construction of a shore connection for container vessels in Sundah\u00f6fn and adjustments to our sailing system to optimize routes and operations, to name a few. The mitigation measures that we are already working on include further adjustments to the sailing system with the aim of reducing sailed miles and bunker consumption, further slow steaming where possible, increasing port efficiency to shorten berth time and exploring alternative fuel options. If we look further ahead, we aim to reduce emission even further and meet our ambitious Sustainability goals, by invest in new and more fuel-efficient vessels, hopefully running on alternative green fuel.\n\nWe firmly believe that the foundation for performance is based on employee satisfaction which is why we put strong emphasis on employee wellness and development, both in our strategy and daily operations. We conduct annual engagement surveys to monitor our employees\u2019 engagement, which is one of our most important KPI\u2019s. This year\u2019s survey was conducted in May and we were pleased with the results which show that our engagement level is not only increasing from previous year, but also that we are doing better on this measure that international companies in similar sectors.\n\nThe outlook for coming quarters is generally stable, where a lot of the uncertainty that has characterized the past year has faded out as the global shipping market has stabilized and the economic and geo-political turmoil following the war in Ukraine has somewhat reduced. Our home market in the North-Atlantic is quite robust, where we are experiencing a record tourist season in Iceland, the outlook for the salmon farming industry both in Iceland and Faroe Islands is promising, and we expect our reefer liner services in Norway to pick up in the fall after a traditional slow season during the summer months. The Trans-Atlantic rates have continued to decrease in Q3 which will inevitably affect our revenue in this trade lane, while the volume outlook remains solid thanks to our unique position as the only international carrier with direct services from Europe to Newfoundland and Portland, Maine. There is generally neutral outlook in our international forwarding operations in a market showing signs of stabilization.\u201d\n\n**INVESTOR MEETING 16 AUGUST 2023**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Eimskipaf\u00e9lag \u00cdslands hf. approved the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for 1 January to 30 June 2023 at its meeting on 15 August 2023.

and storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas. The project developers are tasked with removing one million tons of carbon dioxide per year from the atmosphere and storing the greenhouse gas deep underground.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is still far from profitable and the existing solutions [haven\u2019t shown](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/ieefa-relying-on-carbon-capture-in-fossil-fuel-sector-will-not-work/) sufficient [if any efficiency.](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/carbon-capture-projects-failing-but-still-may-play-role-in-energy-transition/) The market for sequestering carbon dioxide [at the source](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/three-carbon-capture-projects-in-balkans-get-grants-from-eus-innovation-fund/) of emissions, in industrial facilities, is undeveloped. The situation is even more difficult for investors in direct air capture (DAC), struggling to find funding, as carbon removal only spends money.\n\n\nProponents say things may change when demand rises for [synthetic fuels,](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/wabio-from-germany-to-build-20-biogas-plants-in-serbia/) which are produced from captured CO2. Carbon can be utilized in various industries, for instance in the production of concrete or even [diamonds or vodka.](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/new-york-city-startup-air-co-produces-vodka-from-captured-co2/)\n\n\nThe third and easiest way to sequester CO2 is to increase the ability of [soil](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/soil-carbon-storage-in-agriculture-for-climate-and-trade-bonds-and-profits/) to absorb carbon by sustainably managing agriculture and forestry and thus stimulating photosynthesis.\n\n\n### Critics claim CCS is excuse for fossil fuel industry to keep pumping oil, gas\n\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has acknowledged the need for DAC for long-term storage, to mitigate climate change. The United States is determined to come out on top in the field and it is competing with [the European Union](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/eu-launches-subsidy-plan-to-protect-its-green-industry/) in [supporting](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/eu-to-abolish-free-co2-emission-allowances-for-companies-in-2034/) and attracting such investments.\n\n\n\n> The carbon from CO2 can also be turned into rock\n> \n> \n\n\nCritics say public money should be spent on the clean energy transition and other forms of decarbonization, and accuse the fossil fuel industry of supporting and developing carbon capture, utilization and storage projects to have an excuse to keep producing oil, gas and petrochemicals.\n\n\n### Major oil company\u2019s subsidiary heads one of two winning projects\n\n\nThe Department of Energy in Washington DC has just declared the first two winners in its program and awarded a bunch of grants for research and studies from its DAC chest of USD 3.5 billion. It said it aims to pick the remaining two hubs next year.\n\n\nThe consortium that got up to USD 602 million approved is actually led by a subsidiary of [Occidental Petroleum](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/fossil-fuel-giant-occidental-to-capture-carbon-on-behalf-of-airbus/) (also known as Oxy) \u2013 1PointFive. With its partners \u2013 Canada-based Carbon Engineering and American-Australian engineering firm WorleyParsons, going as Worley, it is building the South Texas DAC Hub.\n\n\nLocated in Kleberg County, the complex would push the sequestered greenhouse gas more than three kilometers below ground to permanently store it. The idea is also to store CO2 captured in industrial facilities on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n### Both hubs to be powered by renewables\n\n\nThe second winner, Project Cypress DAC Hub, is under development in southwest Louisiana. It is eligible for USD 500 million to USD 600 million.\n\n\nThe project is run by private nonprofit scientific organization Battelle Memorial Institute from Columbus, Ohio, Climeworks and Heirloom Carbon Technologies. The last of the three is working on ways to mineralize carbon, like what the world\u2019s currently largest CCS facility in [Iceland](https://balkangreenenergynews.com/bulgarian-cement-plant-gets-eu-grant-for-innovative-carbon-capture-storage-project/) does. It is run by Climeworks.\n\n\n\n> Developers of the South Texas DAC Hub hinted that they aim to make more machines at the site to achieve an annual capacity of 30 million tons\n> \n> \n\n\nBoth projects are planned to be powered from renewable sources and are aimed at reaching an annual capacity of one million tons of CO2 each. The developers of the Texas hub said they aspire to build 29 more equivalent carbon removal units at the site and estimated the storage potential at three billion tons.\n\n\nThe two hubs are envisaged to employ a total of 5,000 people. Neither is intended for enhanced oil recovery, which is when captured CO2 is injected into almost depleted wells to squeeze out the remaining oil.\n\n\n\n Post Views: 23\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The United States approved up to USD 1.2 billion in grants for two planned direct air capture and storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas.

Rondo will use this funding to grow its international operations and to develop and build storage projects around the world.\u00a0\n\n\nRio Tinto, Aramco Ventures, SABIC, SCG, TITAN, and SEEIT have joined Rondo's Strategic Investor Advisory Board (SIAB).\u00a0\n\n\n\"We are honored and excited by this opportunity to go faster by working with these leaders. Our Strategic Investor Advisory Board will help Rondo focus on the simplest, fastest ways to power their operations with low-cost clean energy and shape our priorities for ongoing research and development.\" said John O'Donnell, CEO of Rondo Energy. \"To tackle our climate challenge, we need tools to build big, low-cost, clean energy infrastructure fast. The Rondo Heat Battery is one of those tools. This investment will help us grow our capacity to meet customer demand and begin to build at scale.\"\n\n\nIndustry uses more energy than any other part of the world economy. Industrial processes making every commodity from steel to baby food are powered by high temperature heat that consumes a quarter of all world energy and emits a quarter of global carbon pollution. Technologies have long been sought to cost-effectively transform this \"hard to decarbonize\" sector. U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm outlined DOE's vision to cut 85% of industrial heat in its [Industrial Heat Shot Initiative](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3945263-1&h=1012252309&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.energy.gov%2Feere%2Findustrial-heat-shot&a=Industrial+Heat+Shot+Initiative).\n\n\nDeclining wind and solar power costs are now becoming cheaper than the fuel industry burns for heat. The Rondo Heat Battery turns these intermittent power sources into the continuous, high temperature clean heat that industry requires, and opens the door to industrial decarbonization at a fraction of the cost of other technologies.\n\n\nIn 2023, Rondo began operations of its first commercial unit, lowering the carbon intensity of biofuel produced by Calgren Renewable Fuels. This project was the first commercially operating electric thermal energy storage system in the US, and the highest efficiency, highest temperature energy storage of any kind worldwide.\n\n\nIn 2023 Rondo, in partnership with Siam Cement Group (SCG), announced current Heat Battery storage production capacity of 2.4GWh/year, with plans to reach 90GWh/year.\n\n\nRondo Heat Batteries store energy at half the cost of other technologies such as green hydrogen and chemical batteries. Rondo based its innovative technology on materials that heavy industry has used for more than a century for heating and heat storage: brick and iron wire. By building Heat Batteries with materials already made at large scale for more than a century, Rondo has eliminated the safety, durability, and supply chain risks faced by other storage technologies.\n\n\nPolicymakers and business leaders face shareholder pressure to deploy cost-effective and reliable climate solutions, Rondo's technology is a proven and effective tool for rapid and deep decarbonization across the world's most energy intensive and difficult to decarbonize industries.\u00a0\n\n\nElectrification of industrial heat has been called \"the next trillion-dollar market.\" Recent studies have found that the decarbonized world will need twice as much heat battery storage as grid battery storage, and that heat batteries will greatly reduce energy costs to produce many key commodities in the coming few years.\n\n\n**Investor Quotes**\n\n\n**Microsoft** \n\n\n\"To avoid the worst effects of climate change, businesses and sectors must shift to low-carbon energy, including managing the intermittency of renewables through energy storage. We see a unique opportunity for Rondo's thermal storage solution to provide a pathway for industrial businesses to accelerate the clean energy transition.\" said Brandon Middaugh, Senior Director, Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund.\n\n\n**Rio Tinto** \n\n\nRio Tinto Chief Scientist, Nigel Steward, said, \"Rio Tinto and Rondo share a vision of a low-carbon future.\u00a0 It's vital we invest in innovative companies like Rondo to expedite the growth of energy storage technologies.

In light of the success in Held, it won\u2019t be the last.\n\nWhat is a green amendment?\n--------------------------\n\nThe U.S. Constitution does not contain a green amendment, but several state constitutions do.\n\n[Pennsylvania](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/pennsylvania), Montana, [Hawaii](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/hawaii), [Massachusetts](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/massachusetts) and [Illinois](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/illinois) all amended their state constitutions during the environmental movement of the 1970s to recognize the people\u2019s right to a clean and healthful environment.

At that time, Montana\u2019s environmental laws allowed the state to issue permits for projects that would discharge pollutants into Montana waters without conducting any environmental review. The Montana Supreme Court determined that such a law violated Montanans\u2019 fundamental right to a clean and healthful environment and was unconstitutional.\n\nThe next [green amendment success](https://casetext.com/case/robinson-twp-v-pa-pub-util-commn) took 14 years and occurred in Pennsylvania. In the early 2010s, Pennsylvania enacted a state law that gave the oil and gas industry the right to commence [hydraulic fracturing](https://www.epa.gov/uog/process-unconventional-natural-gas-production), or fracking, anywhere in the state. This law prevented local governments from making land use decisions to restrict or limit fracking in their jurisdictions. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court [struck down](https://casetext.com/case/robinson-twp-v-pa-pub-util-commn) this state law as violating Pennsylvanians\u2019 constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.  \n\n\nREAD: \n\n[A Push to Revamp Schools' Outdoor Spaces](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-08-03/rising-temperatures-fuel-changes-to-schools-outdoor-spaces)That Pennsylvania decision ignited an explosion of interest in green amendments.\n\nIn Hawaii, public interest groups began challenging the state\u2019s approval of carbon-intensive electricity generation on the ground that it violates Hawaiians\u2019 right to a clean and healthful environment. The state now relies on its green amendment to [reject new carbon-intensive electricity sources](https://law.justia.com/cases/hawaii/supreme-court/2023/scot-22-0000418.html) for powering Hawaii.\n\nIn 2022, [New York](https://nygreen.pace.edu/) became the first state since the 1970s to adopt a green amendment.

On these grounds, she struck down the state law as unconstitutional.\n\nThis result sets a groundbreaking precedent for climate litigation and demonstrates a new way in which green amendments can be invoked to elicit environmental change. It suggests that in other states with green amendments, state laws cannot forbid the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions and their climate impact during environmental review.  \n\n\n[### The Best States for Natural Environment\n\n![A red canoe rests on a rocky shore of a calm blue lake in the Boundary Waters of Minnesota\n](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/0000016b-fb29-d958-adef-fb3f06b70000/190716-bsenvmn-stock.jpg?update-time=1563287146352&size=responsive640)View All 14 Slides](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/the-10-states-with-the-best-natural-environment)However, Seeley made it clear long before trial that she [does not have the power](https://climatecasechart.com/case/11091/) to order the state to create a remedial plan to address climate change.\n\nFurther, the Montana legislature [repealed](https://www.desmog.com/2023/04/03/montana-repeals-state-energy-policy-as-climate-trial-nears/) the state policies promoting fossil fuel extraction just two months before the trial began, and a judge cannot generally rule on the constitutionality of a repealed law.

It makes use of the weathering process, which naturally sequesters CO2 in carbonate minerals. The concept is straightforward: accelerate weathering while also benefiting people.

[Download a free copy](/industry-focus/agritech-ebook?src=content-embed) The investigators wanted to look beyond national boundaries and further into the future, but a prior study used a different method for estimating carbon dioxide removal to evaluate carbon drawdown by the year 2050.\n\n\nThe scientists tested the sensitivity of enhanced rock weathering to climate and identified the regions where the technique could be most effective by simulating how applying crushed basalt to global croplands would draw down carbon dioxide.\n\n\nThe new model simulated augmented rock weathering on 1,000 agricultural sites worldwide from 2006 to 2080 under two emission scenarios. According to their findings, those agricultural sites would absorb 64 gigatons of carbon dioxide over the course of the 75-year study period. That means if this strategy were to be applied globally across all agricultural fields, up to 217 gigatons of carbon could be sequestered in that time frame.\n\n\n\n> \n> *The latest IPCC report said we need to remove 100 to 1,000 gigatons of carbon by 2100 in addition to steeply reducing emissions to keep global temperature from rising more than one and a half degrees Celsius. Scaling up to global croplands, the estimates of carbon removal we found are roughly comparable to the lower end of that range needed to have a fighting chance of meeting those climate goals*.\n> \n> \n> S. Hun Baek, Study Lead and Climate Scientist, Yale University\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSince weathering occurs more rapidly in hot and humid environments, enhanced rock weathering would occur more quickly in tropical regions than in higher latitudes, according to the study. Farmers and companies investing in carbon-drawdown solutions make cost- and carbon-efficient decisions by focusing on basalt applications in tropical fields.\n\n\nAnother encouraging finding was that improved rock weathering works just as well, if not slightly better, in warmer temperatures. Other carbon-drawdown strategies, like those based on soil organic carbon storage, become less effective as warming continues.\n\n\nBaek says, \u201c*Enhanced rock weathering is surprisingly resilient to climate change. Our results show that it\u2019s relatively insensitive to climate change and works about the same under moderate and severe global warming scenarios. This gives us confidence in its potential as a long-term strategy*.\u201d\n\n\nTo incorporate enhanced rock weathering at scale, Planavsky suggested gradually switching the type of rock used by farmers, who currently apply millions of tonnes of limestone (a calcium carbonate rock that can either be a carbon source or sink) to their fields to provide nutrients and regulate soil acidity.\n\n\nAccording to Planavsky, on a small scale, enhanced rock weathering has been used on farms all over the world. Working toward \u201crealistic implementation\u201d is the next step.\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n------------------\n\n\nBaek, S. H., *et al*. (2023).

Biochar, one form of biocarbon \u2014 charcoal is another that you'll be more familiar with \u2014 also improves soil quality, the reason why it's been used for agriculture for generations.\n\nToday, Finnish startup Carbo Culture has opened one of Europe\u2019s largest biochar plants, a short drive from Helsinki.\u00a0\n\nAdvertisementCarbo Culture says its facility will be able to remove 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a year \u2014 roughly equivalent to the emissions of 1,500 petrol cars. It's not a huge amount, but the team says this facility will lay the groundwork for more.\u00a0\n\nInterest in biochar is growing, particularly as the [voluntary carbon markets,](https://sifted.eu/articles/startups-carbon-credits-markets-offsetting/) where individuals and companies purchase carbon credits to reach their net zero goals, increasingly look for credits which actively remove carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nThe number of biochar production plants in Europe is expected to reach 180 by the end of 2023. Other European plants include Carbofex, which is also located in Finland and removes over 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. Globally, one of the largest biochar plants opened in Canada earlier this year \u2014 owned by CARBONITY, it has an initial capacity of storing 10k tonnes per year.\n\nCarbo Culture was founded in 2016 by Henrietta Moon and Chris Carstens, who are CEO and CTO respectively. It\u2019s raised $9.2m in total, from VCs including Cherry Ventures and \u00dcbermorgen Ventures, as well as angels including Icelandic entrepreneur David Helgason and Albert Wenger, managing partner at Union Square Ventures.\n\nThe new plant was funded by a \u20ac2.2m grant from the European Innovation Council. The plant is intended to show the industrial scalability of Carbo Culture\u2019s tech before it builds commercial-scale facilities.\n\nSifted Newsletters\n\nClimate Tech\n\nEvery Thursday\n\nThe green transition is underway \u2014 meet the startups driving it.\n\nJoin to Sign UpSifted Newsletters\n\nClimate Tech\n\nEvery Thursday\n\nThe green transition is underway \u2014 meet the startups driving it.\n\nJoin to Sign Up![Wind turbine](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/01212637/climate-tech1.png?w=400&dpr=2&q=75&auto=format,compress&crop=faces,edges)### How biochar works\n\nBiochar works by capitalising on the natural carbon-storing ability of plants, like trees or crops, which draw carbon out of the atmosphere into their biomass. When plants decompose, that carbon is released. But by heating the biomass up and turning it into biochar, the release of carbon can be circumvented.\n\n\u201cYou try to take the biomass to a high temperature without burning it,\u201d explains Moon. \u201cIf you burn all of it, you have no carbon left, so you try to take it to a high temperature without actually losing the carbon so that it converts into a biocarbon format.\u201d\u00a0\n\n![A close up of someone holding biochar in the palm of their hand.](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/08135605/carboculture-biochar-4-2.png?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75) Biochar has been used to enrich soil for centuries (Photo: Carbo Culture)The latest research suggests stable forms could lock in carbon emissions for millions of years.\u00a0\n\nThe attraction of biochar, Moon says, is that it's easier to scale at present than methods like [direct air capture](https://sifted.eu/articles/carbon-capture-storage-startups-europe-brnd/) \u2014 where machines remove carbon dioxide directly from the air. \u201cIf you look at the other removal methods, they might be able to scale in a decade or two,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the natural systems are scalable today.\"\u00a0\n\n### R3\n\nCarbo Culture\u2019s plant \u2014 dubbed R3 \u2014 will use dust pellets left over from nearby wood manufacturers as its feedstock. It\u2019s critical, Moon says, that the plant uses only waste wood that couldn\u2019t be used for another primary use, such as a building material.\n\nR3\u2019s feedstock will travel 10km to the plant. Keeping the feedstock supply chain local helps ensure the emissions associated with the process remain low.\n\nAdvertisement### What can we use biochar for?\n\nBiochar has a dual function. As well as locking in carbon, the resulting product can be put onto soil to improve its nutritional value and its water retention potential. That\u2019s particularly important in areas with flooding.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt acts as a sponge, retaining some of the nutrients and water, which is especially important for climate adaptation,\u201d says Moon.\n\nThe other output is energy. \u201cWe trap about 50% of the carbon that's contained in the original biomass, but 50% of the carbon we lose as gases,\u201d she adds. \u201cThose gases are used for district heating.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCarbo Culture also plans to partner with industrial companies for its first commercial deals, and build the plants on their land. The aim is that they\u2019d be able to both turn their waste biomass into biochar and use the energy produced in their industrial process too.\n\n### Selling credits and scaling up\n\nCarbo Culture has already started selling carbon credits for its first commercial facility \u2014 the one it\u2019ll build next. It's secured multinational investment bank Rothschild & Co as a client, as well as a deal with NextGen, a joint venture between South Pole and Mitsubishi, to buy carbon removal credits.\n\nThe facility that opened today is a critical milestone for Carbo Culture. For startups building infrastructure, getting the first facility off the ground can be a big hurdle \u2014 you need investor cash to do it, but many investors want to see a facility working before they fund it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cR3 is super important for investors or even for the government-backed lenders,\u201d says Moon.\u00a0\n\nThe next step for Carbo Culture will be building commercial facilities \u2014 they\u2019ll incorporate multiple biochar reactors, compared to R3 which has just one.\n\n\u201cThat's the serious debugging phase, because you're under contract, and you have to hit your run time and they have to operate for a decade,\u201d says Moon. \u201cThen you can think of a global rollout where you get to hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 removal.\u201d\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Finnish startup Carbo Culture has opened one of Europe\u2019s largest biochar plants, which can remove 3,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per year.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The opening of the biochar plant is seen as a critical milestone for the company."}, {"summary": "Biochar is gaining interest as a method to remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere and improve soil quality.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Biochar can store emissions and has been used for agriculture for generations."}, {"summary": "Interest in biochar is growing as voluntary carbon markets seek credits that actively remove carbon.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The demand for biochar is increasing in the carbon market."}, {"summary": "Carbo Culture's biochar plant was funded by a \u20ac2.2m grant from the European Innovation Council.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The funding reflects support and belief in the company's technology."}, {"summary": "Biochar can lock in carbon emissions for millions of years and is scalable compared to other removal methods.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Biochar offers a scalable solution for carbon removal."}, {"summary": "Carbo Culture plans to partner with industrial companies to build commercial facilities and turn waste biomass into biochar.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The plan for commercial partnerships and utilization of waste biomass is a strategic move."}, {"summary": "Carbo Culture has already started selling carbon credits and has secured clients and deals.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The company has successfully entered the carbon market and secured important partnerships."}, {"summary": "The next step for Carbo Culture is to build commercial facilities and achieve a global rollout.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The company has a clear plan for expansion and scaling up."}], "semantic_commentary": "Promising biochar plant with carbon removal potential.", "sentiment_score": 1.0, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions a startup that has opened a biochar plant, which is a system designed to remove carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions Carbo Culture selling carbon credits and planning to partner with industrial companies to build commercial facilities, indicating their commitment to reducing carbon footprint."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about biochar, which is a method to remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere."}]}, {"source": "Dialogo Chino", "link": "https://dialogochino.net/en/climate-energy/376869-can-new-tech-make-carbon-offsets-trustworthy/", "title": "Can new tech make carbon offsets trustworthy?", "content": "Carbon offsets have a reputation problem. The basic concept \u2013 that a reduction in carbon emissions or increase in carbon storage can compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere \u2013 sounds plausible, but successive scandals have plagued the market for years. Schemes have been accused of providing money to projects that would have gone ahead anyway, do not reduce carbon emissions, lead to an increase elsewhere, and damage local communities or biodiversity.\n\nMuch work is underway to rectify this. For example, [a raft of standards and guidance](https://icvcm.org/icvcm-and-vcmi-join-forces-to-operationalize-a-high-integrity-market-to-accelerate-global-climate-action/) is due this year, to define best practice and improve credibility in the use of carbon credits by companies. This kicked off in late June with [a code of practice](https://vcmintegrity.org/vcmi-claims-code-of-practice/) from the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) for businesses to follow when using and making claims about carbon credits as part of net-zero commitments.\n\nMonitoring tech leads the way\n-----------------------------\n\nMany believe one way to help fix offsets could be new technologies to digitise monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). This is a multi-stage process used to measure the amount of greenhouse gas emissions reduced or absorbed by a particular activity, such as reforestation, over a period of time. The findings are then reported to a third party to be verified so that carbon credits can be issued for trade on international carbon markets or used by corporations towards their net-zero targets.\n\nToday\u2019s conventional MRV techniques involve time-consuming manual processes and analogue data capture through in-person auditing of sites. Some digital technologies are already used, such as greenhouse gas inventory software, remote sensing and satellite positioning systems. But they comprise only around 10% of the process, according to a [report](https://www.goldstandard.org/our-story/digitising-mrv\"report) by a working group on the subject set up by Gold Standard, a carbon credit certification programme.\n\nDigital MRV would use various technologies \u2013 such as satellites and drones, artificial intelligence, blockchain encryption and \u201csmart sensors\u201d (which can analyse data, not just record it) \u2013 to automate data collection, analysis and validation, and provide more reliable and consistent data far more quickly. This will in turn reduce the costs and time associated with issuing new carbon credits.\n\nOne example, launched at last year\u2019s COP27 climate talks, is [CTrees](https://ctrees.org/), a nonprofit which claims to be the world\u2019s first-ever global system for accurately calculating the amount of carbon in every tree on the planet. It covers both carbon emissions and removals from all types of forests, at a resolution of one hectare \u2013 equivalent to just over one soccer pitch.\n\n\n> Our dataset observes everything\n\nDr Sassan Saatchi, NASA\u2019s\u00a0Jet Propulsion LaboratoryThe platform is built on AI-enabled satellite data, bringing near real-time data to buyers, project developers and regulators involved in carbon markets, as well as governments, the private sector and civil society.\n\nCTrees is led by Dr Sassan Saatchi, a senior scientist at\u00a0NASA\u2019s\u00a0Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a team of scientists and data engineers in the US, Brazil, Denmark and France. Supported by a combination of philanthropy and revenue from providing data products to partner nonprofits, it draws on more than 20 years of research and development by universities and space agencies worldwide.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEarly this year, CTrees started to provide operational data for project-level assessments of forest carbon. The fact that the dataset is global means it can track issues that have beset carbon markets for years \u2013 such as so-called \u201cleakage\u201d, where a policy or project designed to protect forests leads to deforestation shifting to another region, Saatchi says.\u00a0\n\n![low angle view of a spacecraft in a laboratory](https://dialogochino.net/content/uploads/2023/08/20230815_NISAR-flight-antenna-launch_NASA.jpg)A view of NISAR\u2019s flight antenna system. The radar technology used on the mission will image nearly all of Earth\u2019s land and ice masses, and the CTrees platform can integrate such data. (Image: [NASA](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/112/nisars-flight-antenna-system-undergoes-thermal-vacuum-testing-at-nasas-jet-propulsion-laboratory/))\u201cOur dataset observes everything \u2013 you can see easily if deforestation has gone up in the area, or 100 km away, or even in another jurisdiction, or another country. Social scientists and economists can use the data to really understand where the leakage is happening.\u201d\n\nCTrees\u00a0is to launch a free global alerts system for land-use change later this year that will produce notifications for activities like deforestation\u00a0or degradation every two weeks, increasing to every week starting in 2024. This will allow for faster interventions from governments, he explains, as\u00a0annual aggregations of carbon emissions and removals will provide policymakers with information that they can use to assess whether their programmes are generating the intended results.\n\nThe CTrees platform can integrate new data and science as it becomes available \u2013 for example, from the [NISAR](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/quick-facts/) mission, a joint Earth-observing project between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation due to launch next year. The radar technology used on that mission will image nearly all of Earth\u2019s land and ice masses, four to six times per month. Information on forest volume and biomass will be detailed enough to reveal changes on a human scale. The technology will halve the uncertainty associated with measuring the variability of changes in forest biomass, Saatchi says.\n\nBringing disparate data together\n--------------------------------\n\nAnother new digital platform, from the [Climate Action Data Trust](https://climateactiondata.org/) (CAD Trust), aims to link, aggregate and harmonise data from all major carbon registries, which may be run by governments or private companies. These registries track carbon projects, issue credits and record the ownership of offsets by giving each a serial number in order to mitigate the risk of double counting, where two organisations claim the same tonne of carbon removed.\n\nUntil it launches in the third quarter of this year, anyone wanting to cross-check registries for the same credit must do so manually, according to Yuvaraj Dinesh Babu, executive director of CAD Trust. This will only get more time-consuming as more countries set up registries and start to trade credits following the adoption of rules on international carbon trading at UN climate talks, he points out.\n\nCAD Trust\u2019s platform will provide a central place where anyone can check that credits are not being double counted \u2013 and, being run on blockchain technology, all actions that registries take on it will be auditable, he says.\n\nEventually, Babu hopes that all national carbon registries will be linked through the platform. It could then be used to prove what countries have achieved against their national climate strategies through the UN climate convention stocktaking process, a key part of the Paris Agreement through which countries assess what has been achieved against international climate targets, to help inform future action.\n\n![a satellite map of the amazonas](https://dialogochino.net/content/uploads/2023/08/20230815_Satellite-carbon-stock-CTrees_Screenshot_20230902.png)A screengrab from the CTrees portal showing the \u2018carbon density\u2019 of land in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, home to a large part of the Amazon rainforest. The darker the colour, the more CO2 stored per hectare of land. (Image: CTrees)Another carbon registry aggregation platform, [AlliedOffsets](https://alliedoffsets.com/), is also aiming to make it easier and quicker to find a variety of information, including what offset projects a particular company has bought credits from, whether they have bought the volume they say they have, and the quality of each project.\n\n\u201cWe realised how opaque the whole sector is [and] how poor information gathering was, and we started to ask questions such as why this one credit costs $2 and another $50, when they\u2019re supposedly for the same thing \u2013 a tonne of carbon. That seems insane,\u201d says Lars Kroijer, the firm\u2019s founder and managing director.\n\n\u201cWe aggregate all the ratings companies, the brokers, and the news sources so you can find everything in one place \u00ad\u2013 whether you\u2019re a buyer, a broker, a project developer or an academic,\u201d says Kroijer. \u201cIf someone wants to find all [the] nature-based solution projects in India, I could answer that question in three minutes. In the past, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019d start; it could take months.\u201d\n\nStandardising standards\n-----------------------\n\nGiven all these developments, offset certification bodies such as Gold Standard and Verra, as well as other organisations with an interest in carbon markets such as the World Bank, have been scrambling to assess, pilot and produce guidance, technologies and standards on digital MRV.\n\nVerra, which claims to be the world\u2019s largest carbon credits programme, is piloting a digital MRV platform that uses remote-sensing to measure forest carbon, provided by climate tech company Pachama.\n\nVerra says it will not be issuing credits using any data provided by the pilot, but rather will compare the digital system to its current approach in terms of accuracy, and assess if \u2013 and how \u2013 it could use the data. It will produce a document on its findings later this year for consultation with its stakeholders.\n\n[Benktesh Sharma](https://verra.org/staff/benktesh-sharma/), Verra\u2019s senior director of technology solutions, explains that current MRV methods mean reports sent by those carrying out a project for it to audit are inconsistent. \u201cThey have their own interpretation of how to use methodologies to come up with estimations of greenhouse gas reductions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut digital MRV will give us a standardised approach to handling this data, and we can check the data quality easily.\n\n\u201cIt will be shifting a mindset, from where you try to wrangle around various documents, to working on a digital interface. And users won\u2019t have to create a PDF document, or print a document and upload [it] into the system,\u201d he adds. \u201cRather, data will be moving from machine to machine.\u201d\n\nIn theory, digital systems will allow us to check the quality of data for a particular project, such as its location and how it was created. Incomplete or incorrect information would be flagged to Verra, according to [Rishi Das](https://verra.org/staff/rishi-das/), Verra\u2019s manager of technologies for natural climate solutions, who says that this should filter out any bad projects from its system. However, if malpractice is suspected in any project the programme has issued credits on, it will be far easier to scrutinise digital information rather than go through pages of PDFs provided by projects, he says.\n\nDemand for quality offsets in the voluntary carbon market outstrips supply, Sharma adds, and it currently takes many years from starting an offset project to the point where credits are issued. A more efficient, digital process could drastically reduce this timescale, meaning that carbon reduction projects could be scaled up much more quickly, he says.\n\nWhat are the downsides?\n-----------------------\n\nDigital MRV could save a lot of time, prevent human error, and improve transparency across the board, providing more companies and investors with confidence in voluntary carbon markets, acknowledges Ana Carolina Szklo, technical director of markets and standards at the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity initiative (VCMI). But she sees some disadvantages to digital MRV.\n\n\u201cDigital MRV such as satellite monitoring of forests is expensive, so we just have to be mindful that we don\u2019t exclude companies and developing countries that don\u2019t have the resources to promote and implement such modern technology systems,\u201d she says.\n\nTechnology doesn\u2019t solve all problems, she adds; it just flags up potential issues which would then need to be investigated with a physical visit to the site. For example, in Brazil, some images of forestry projects have captured other land-use changes. A satellite image on its own cannot prove if the project owner did it deliberately, or if fire could have been spread accidentally from a neighbouring area, she says.\n\n\n> It\u2019s easy to get up on your soapbox and yell, but the underlying solutions to climate change are sometimes technical\n\nLars Kroijer, Founder and managing director at AlliedOffsetsHuman auditors should also maintain a role in MRV systems, as their analysis of the data is very important, she stresses. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019re ready to just hand that all over to machines and technology, and not have any human brain capacity actually doing analysis behind all the data.\u201d\n\nMeeting targets for emissions reductions is not all about maths, she says. Some elements that need to be taken into account are subjective, such as the need for companies to have strong governance structures in place to be able to make good decisions on which projects in carbon markets to invest in.\n\n\u201cIt takes some time to process and disseminate technology to ensure that there\u2019s confidence behind everything, so that investors can bring resources, and the private sector can implement projects,\u201d she says, adding that many of these technologies have to go through a pilot phase.\n\nKroijer is optimistic that digital MRV can be part of the solution to overcoming scepticism to carbon markets. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get up on your soapbox and yell, but the underlying solutions to climate change are sometimes technical, and they need to be worked out over a long period of time,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s a lot of bad in this space, but find me any space with 25,000 projects where there isn\u2019t a flaw.\u201d\n\n*This article was originally published on\u00a0[China Dialogue](https://chinadialogue.net/en/business/can-new-tech-make-carbon-offsets-trustworthy/).*\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Carbon offsets have a reputation problem due to scandals and issues with credibility.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Scandals and issues have plagued the market for years."}, {"summary": "New technologies, such as satellite and drone monitoring, AI, and blockchain, could help fix the issues with carbon offsets by digitizing monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV).", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article focuses on the potential benefits of these technologies, but does not explicitly state a positive or negative sentiment."}, {"summary": "CTrees, a nonprofit, uses AI-enabled satellite data to calculate carbon emissions and removals from forests, providing near real-time data for buyers and regulators.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The use of AI-enabled satellite data brings near real-time data, which is a positive advancement."}, {"summary": "Climate Action Data Trust is developing a platform to link and harmonize data from carbon registries to prevent double counting of carbon credits.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The platform will mitigate the risk of double counting, which is a positive outcome."}, {"summary": "Verra is piloting a digital MRV platform using remote sensing to measure forest carbon, aiming to standardize approaches and improve data quality.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The digital MRV platform aims to standardize approaches and improve data quality, which are positive outcomes."}, {"summary": "Digital MRV has advantages in time-saving, error prevention, and transparency, but there are concerns about excluding companies and developing countries without resources for such technology.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The article presents both advantages and concerns, resulting in a neutral sentiment overall."}], "semantic_commentary": "Article: New technologies improve carbon offset credibility and transparency.\n", "sentiment_score": 0.3333333333333333, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article discusses new technologies that could help fix the issues with carbon offsets."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon offsets, such as scandals and credibility issues."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions nonprofit organizations and companies using AI-enabled satellite data to calculate carbon emissions and removals."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the development of a digital MRV platform using remote sensing to measure forest carbon."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article discusses the advantages of digital MRV, such as time-saving, error prevention, and transparency."}, {"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article raises concerns about excluding companies and developing countries without resources for the technology."}]}, {"source": "BusinessDesk", "link": "https://businessdesk.co.nz/article/sustainable-finance/carbon-offsetting-a-distraction-from-genuine-emissions-reductions", "title": "Carbon offsetting a 'distraction' from genuine emissions reductions | BusinessDesk", "content": "Unlock all stories free for 10 days\n\n \n Stay informed on business, government and financial developments across New Zealand from our team of 27 journalists.\n \n\n \n\n---\n\n * Deeply researched, twice-edited and fact-checked news\n* Reporters in Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown\n* Personalised email news alerts, plus gift up to 5 stories a month to non-subscribers\n* Access to FundSource - the deepest data on KiwiSaver and managed funds, updated daily\n* World news from Bloomberg\n \n\n---\n\n We won\u2019t charge for 10 days.

But in fact, the IRA was not intended to be, nor is it, protectionist. Its mission, coupled with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act, was to spark private- and public-sector investment across the U.S.\u2014in red and blue states\u2014and beyond, while restoring U.S. leadership on the global stage.\n\n In its first year of implementation, the IRA has been a game changer. It spurred a race to the top. The world\u2019s major economies rushed to develop their own competitive climate plans and opened up unprecedented opportunities to take a big bite out of global [carbon emissions](https://time.com/6205570/inflation-reduction-act-carbon-capture/) while enhancing domestic economies, growing good-paying clean energy jobs, saving families money, and improving air quality and health outcomes\u2014especially for communities most in need.\n\n \n The European Union\u2019s Green Deal Industrial Policy was announced in February this year. In March, Canada\u2019s budget included IRA-inspired tax credits to spark production of minerals and EV components while strengthening labor conditions. France\u2019s new climate [framework](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/france-offer-new-tax-credit-business-investments-green-technologies-2023-05-11/) was unveiled in May. And Germany plans to expand its battery cell production, create a new hydrogen center, and initiate [investments in chip manufacturing](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/new-chip-plant-key-german-success-climate-friendly-technologies-scholz).\n\n \n\nBiden Just Signed the Inflation Reduction ActMore Videos0 seconds of 3 minutes, 31 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledPlay/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume\u2191Decrease Volume\u2193Seek Forward\u2192Seek Backward\u2190Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemSeek %0-9\n \n\n\n facebook twitter Email Linkhttps://time.com/6305001/inflation-reduction-act-what-happens-next/Copied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive00:0003:3103:31\u00a0\n \nThese plans are designed to level the cost of renewables and other clean energy solutions. Doing so will allow clean sources to more effectively compete against coal and other damaging fossil-fuel-reliant technologies and products that have too often avoided accountability for the global climate and health damages they caused.\n\n \n **Read more:** *[How the Inflation Reduction Act Has Reshaped the U.S.\u2014and The World](https://time.com/6304143/inflation-reduction-act-us-global-impact/)*\n\n In the U.S., companies have announced or moved forward with projects in 44 states since the IRA was passed, accounting for more than [170,600 new clean energy jobs and $278 billion in new investments](https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2023/07/Clean-Energy-Boom-Anniversary-Report-1.pdf). Our [goals](https://americaisallin.com/Beyond50) under the Paris Agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 are now within reach. The U.S. can head to the global COP28 climate negotiations this fall ready to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\n\n \n But as we celebrate the biggest climate investment the U.S. has ever made, let\u2019s also recognize that we can, should, and must do more now to reduce\u2014and over time eliminate\u2014our reliance on fossil fuels. And we must support developing nations on this path as well. We cannot solely rely on the fast buildup of clean energy if we hope to deliver net zero by 2050. We must demand reductions in fossil fuel exploration, development, and use now to ensure the transition to a cleaner, safer, healthier, and more stable world for all countries.\n\n First, let\u2019s push harder to nudge fossil fuels out of domestic and international markets and shift to energy systems that meet the needs of developing countries at lower costs. This will not only help strengthen economies but also create cleaner air to breathe. African nations, for example, can benefit greatly from leapfrogging to a clean energy future and yet over the last 20 years, [only 2%](https://www.irena.org/publications/2022/Jan/Renewable-Energy-Market-Analysis-Africa) of global renewable energy investments were made in Africa. Meanwhile, investments for polluting oil and gas projects, including from American and European multinationals, continue to pour in, at a great cost to the continent.\n\n Second, we must push to ensure that every developed country meets or exceeds its country-level commitments already made to the developing world, as well as marshall the global public finance resources commanded by the World Bank and regional development banks. And we must demand full and fair consideration of the costs of political inaction versus the full benefits of public investment in climate action. As Barbados Prime Minister [Mia Motley](https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2022/6177695/mia-mottley/) so clearly articulated when announcing the [Bridgetown Initiative](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-bridgetown-initiative-asking-paris-financial-summit-2023-06-20/) last [September](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/09/23/mia-mottley-builds-global-coalition-to-make-financial-system-fit-for-climate-action/), developing nations need multilateral development banks to focus on their missions, not just higher returns, so nations can open up private investments in ways that work for them, define their own paths toward economic security, and deliver the transition to clean energy we need.\n\n \n **Read more:** *[Here's How to Actually Make Rich Countries Pay For Their Climate Impact](https://time.com/6225264/climate-reparations-rich-countries-barbados/)*\n\n Third, public investments are simply not enough; we must entice more private sector investment in the developing world if we hope to preserve and protect the world\u2019s critical natural resources and support the growth and development of clean energy economies that align with country-specific needs and opportunities.\n\n A functioning carbon credit trading system can entice private investments\u2014lowering project costs as credits are generated and sold to corporations and other institutions\u2014as a way to meet their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments. Unfortunately, concerns about greenwashing and months of debate about new and improved carbon market rules have left both sellers and buyers facing significant uncertainties that are stalling investment and frustrating corporations and institutions. What we need is a more realistic and credible system that utilizes the latest technologies, ensures transparency, and jumpstarts finance to prevent further deforestation and meet the clean energy needs of developing countries.\n\n It is time for all of us to stop turning a blind eye to the developing world when it continues to be hit by climate impacts first and worst, when it has contributed the least to the climate crisis, and when it literally has the fewest resources available to respond to the havoc that climate change is wreaking. Just last month, for example, India [stopped exporting rice](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-prohibits-export-non-basmati-white-rice-notice-2023-07-20/#:~:text=NEW%20DELHI%2C%20July%2020%20(Reuters,inflation%20on%20global%20food%20markets)\u2014food that 40% of the world currently relies on as a staple in their diets\u2014when they were hit by heavy monsoon rains that damaged domestic crops. The impact will be far-reaching: Farmers will lose crops and money, while families suffer from hunger, malnutrition, and other life-threatening health challenges.\n\n \n So on this one-year anniversary of the IRA, let\u2019s do more than celebrate its ongoing success and push to keep implementing its provisions fast and furiously. Let\u2019s push [Congress](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-thwaites/us-international-climate-finance-fails-again-meet-moment) to meet our international climate financing commitments to provide $11.4 billion per year by 2024 to the developing world. Let\u2019s equip developing nations with the resources they need to secure their place in a clean energy future. Let\u2019s encourage our government leaders to work across all international venues to open up public and private sector investments for the good of our families, our communities, our countries, and our world.\n\n \n\nMore Must-Reads From TIME\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n* **[She Wasn't Able to Get An Abortion.

The non-profit initiative [Ecosystem Marketplace](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/the-art-of-integrity-state-of-the-voluntary-carbon-markets-q3-2022/) painted an optimistic picture for 2022 in its annual \u201cState of the Voluntary Carbon Markets\u201d report, as carbon prices trended upwards.\n\n\nIn 2021, carbon prices soared to a global average of US$4 per tonne \u2013 a value not seen since 2013 \u2013 driven largely by rising prices for nature-based credits, which often trade at a premium due to the additional non-carbon benefits they bring, such as local community development and biodiversity conservation.\n\n\nHowever, since its peak at the start of 2022, the price of nature-based offsets has slumped by over 90 per cent, to US$1.82 at the time of publication,\u00a0coinciding with macroeconomic headwinds and media reports that have called into question the environmental claims surrounding\u00a0certified rainforest credits, which are used by notable international corporations.\n\n\n![NGEO Prices 2022 to 2023](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/ngeo_prices_falling_2022_to_2023.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nNature-based Global Emissions Offsets (N-GEO), or carbon credits generated by projects that reduce, remove, or prevent carbon emissions through nature-based solutions, were trading at a premium over other offsets in the voluntary carbon market in 2022. However, their prices have since plummeted. Source: CarbonCredits.com\n\n\n\nCriticisms of REDD+ are not new.\u00a0As a type of avoidance carbon credits, which focus on preventing greenhouse gas emissions that would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere, most observers have pointed to how REDD+ offsets can never perfectly predict long-term emission reductions.\u00a0\n\n\nCharles Bedford, chief impact officer of the global carbon markets investing firm Carbon Growth Partners, shares this sentiment. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to pick fights in the carbon market because all carbon projects are based upon a prediction about the future, and all predictions about the future are wrong. It\u2019s just about how much.\u201d\n\n\nBefore becoming a carbon markets investor, Bedford was the Asia Pacific managing director of The Nature Conservancy, a global non-profit conservation group. He left The Nature Conservancy\u00a0to start Carbon Growth Partners in 2021, with the aim of unlocking more funding for nature conservation and restoration projects \u2013 traditionally the realm of philanthropic causes \u2013 while generating financial returns for investors.\n\n\nHaving worked on conservation solutions, including market-based solutions, for over two decades, Bedford has seen the carbon offsets market develop since its infancy. He believes that REDD+ projects remain the best bet for incentivising developing countries with significant forest cover \u2013 which tend to be nations with low governance, as Bedford points out \u2013 to prevent deforestation.\n\n\n\u201cNot cutting down a forest means forgoing income from harvesting timber. So if we don\u2019t figure out a way to replace the income that poor countries can get from harvesting the forest, then they will harvest the forest,\u201d Bedford said.\n\n\nUnder the REDD+ framework, developing countries can receive results-based payment for reducing emissions from deforestation. But there have been controversies around how the financial incentives and benefit-sharing mechanisms are structured in these projects, and how consent is obtained from [Indigenous peoples](https://www.eco-business.com/news/tag/indigenous-peoples/) and local communities that own the land.\n\n\nFor these reasons, it takes \u201ca lot of effort\u201d to get comfortable with such projects. \u201cWe believe in REDD+, but it takes a fair bit of due diligence to be comfortable with REDD+ projects, so we\u2019ve only invested in a few of them,\u201d Bedford shared with Eco-Business on a trip to Cambodia\u2019s Keo Seima and Southern Cardamom REDD+ projects that several media outlets were invited to.\n\n\n![Mountain of confiscated chainsaws](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/DSC_0854.jpg?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nCharles Bedford (middle) looking at a pile of over 6,000 confiscated chainsaws amassed from the last decade at the Sre Ambel Patrol Station within the Southern Cardamom REDD+ project. Image: Eco-Business/Gabrielle See\n\n\n\nBedford said his firm has done \u201cshallow\u201d due diligence on all 30 REDD+ projects that have issued considerable credits, and \u201cdeep\u201d due diligence on the top ten projects**,** which account for about 90 per cent of these issued credits. To date, Carbon Growth Partners has only invested in REDD+ projects in Asia and Latin America, like Cambodia\u2019s Keo Seima and Colombia\u2019s Selva de Matav\u00e9n, but is starting to look at Africa after a recent hire there.\n\n\nAmid the market turbulence last year, the firm\u2019s original fund, Carbon Growth Opportunities Fund, outperformed other benchmarks like the global derivatives marketplace CME Group\u2019s Nature-based Global Emissions Offsets (N-GEO) and GEO. The investment manager has attributed this performance to its focus on high-quality carbon assets and diversified portfolio.\n\n\nIn terms of project type, the fund was less exposed to REDD+ and non-CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) renewables, and more exposed to blue carbon and cookstoves, which held up better in value compared to the first two project types last year.\n\n\nAs the VCM seeks to restore trust, \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d have become the latest buzzwords among industry players. For this reason, numerous guides for companies looking to buy credible forest carbon offsets have also been freshly penned this year by the [World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)](https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy/Climate/Natural-Climate-Solutions/The-Natural-Climate-Solutions-Alliance/Resources/A-Buyer-s-Guide-to-Natural-Climate-Solutions-Carbon-Credits) and [eight conservation and Indigenous organisations](https://tfciguide.org/).\n\n\nBedford ran Eco-Business through a checklist his firm uses to \u201cgo deeper\u201d into the quality of REDD+ projects, once basic due diligence, such as verifying credentials of the project on a trusted registry and assessing counterparty risks, has been done.\n\n\n#### The three factors he looks out for in REDD+ offsets:\n\n\n**1. A conservative baseline**\n\n\nThere are two main components in a conservative baseline, Bedford said. First, the deforestation rate in the country must not be overestimated at the time of assessment. Second, the deforestation rate for the country where the project is located must not go below what was estimated. For instance, if the deforestation rate for a country was conservatively estimated at 1 per cent but turned out to be 2 per cent after a decade, the project is theoretically generating credits twice as good as it claimed.\n\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest carbon credits certifier Verra recently updated its [new consolidated methodology](https://verra.org/verra-reaches-key-milestones-in-finalizing-new-redd-methodology/), which uses a jurisdictional allocation approach to determine project baselines so that\u00a0projects no longer have to rely on a reference region \u2013 or a nearby area with similar drivers of deforestation \u2013 to project future deforestation. Project baselines are also now re-assessed every six years instead of ten.\n\n\nProject design documents (PDDs) typically have 60 to 70 pages dedicated to complex calculations of the baseline emissions and carbon stocks within the project, which is particularly important in the avoided deforestation world.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a REDD+ problem,\u201d said Bedford, who added that a conservative baseline is also important in other project types like cookstoves and renewable energy, \u201cBut it\u2019s a REDD+ problem because it\u2019s just a little harder to make predictions about the future and be right about them.\u201d\n\n\nCarbon Growth Partners outsources the work of poring over PDDs and cross-checking the historical data cited in them to third party vendors with skill sets in remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) analysis in forestry.\n\n\nRating agencies, like Sylvera, offer subscription access to baseline estimations, which Carbon Growth Partners also uses. \u201cThat gives us an easy first step and if we feel like we need to get deeper, then we\u2019ll hire somebody to go even deeper,\u201d said Bedford. \u201cOften, the big buyers in the corporate sector will use rating agencies as a surrogate to do the hard due diligence for them.\u201d\n\n\n![Jahoo camp biodiversity monitoring](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/carbon_surveying.JPG?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)\nA staff from the Jahoo Gibbon Camp, a sustainable ecotourism\u00a0camp\u00a0within the Keo Seima REDD+ project, conducting a maintenance check on an arboreal camera trap, which contributes to the biodiversity monitoring at the site. Image: Eco-Business/Gabrielle See\n\n\n\nBedford emphasised that his firm is \u201cnot dependent\u201d on rating agencies. They are either employed as upfront screening tools to weed out poorly rated REDD+ projects, or from a defensive perspective, to keep up to date with rating changes for projects it owns, in case the changes affect the market value of these projects.\n\n\n**2.\u00a0Strong implementation capacity**\n\n\nPotential buyers should look at the track record and experience of project developers, who are non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or private companies, to assess how well they can implement projects with rural communities in low governance countries.\n\n\nWhile most of this due diligence can be done online, Bedford said that he prefers to meet project developers and partners where the project is located, so they can walk him through it. For this reason, Bedford visited Cambodia\u2019s Keo Seima REDD+ project, which is supported by the international conservation NGO Wildlife Conservation Society, before investing in it. He is also considering investing in the Southern Cardamom REDD+ project which he visited.\n\n\nAs of 19 June, Verra has opened up a\u00a0review of the Southern Cardamom project on the back of allegations of rights abuses by the NGO Human Rights Watch. The project is suspended from any new credit issuances while the investigation is ongoing.\n\n\n**3.\u00a0Ownership of the project by\u00a0Indigenous peoples and local communities**\n\n\nFor more qualitative aspects of the project, like its ownership by\u00a0Indigenous peoples and local communities, Bedford said the company would send independent people on the ground to assess them. These people will need to be knowledgeable about the country, the local contexts, and what a good development project looks like.\n\n\nThe issue of ownership concerns both figurative buy-in from the communities \u2013 determined by speaking to people on site \u2013 as well as literal ownership, around deal structure and funds flow. \u201cThe traceability of funds from the retiree [of the carbon credit] back down to where and how much is spent on the ground is important both from a project success and equity perspective,\u201d said Bedford.\n\n\n[![Keo Seima Funds](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/Keo_Seima_Funds.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=45&w=680)](https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/Keo_Seima_Funds.png?auto=format&dpr=2&fit=max&q=45&w=2000)\nA flowchart showing how the Keo Seima REDD+ revenue feeds back into government, project, and community funding. Source: WCS Cambodia\n\n\n\n#### Additional factors:\n\n\n**1. Country risk**\n\n\nA country can have high sovereign risk, which is\u00a0the risk of a government defaulting on its debt,\u00a0but potentially still carry less risk of reversal in emissions avoidance. Bedford cited the example of Cambodia, which has relatively high economic and political risks, but generally \u201cscores well\u201d in his view for REDD+ projects due to its commitment to the REDD+ model, as well as the clarity around its nationally determined contribution (NDC) and the financing needed to achieve it.\n\n\n**2. Implementation risk**\n\n\nThis refers to how well partners can execute the project on the ground, which depends on their experience, political connections, and sensitivity to local communities.\n\n\n**3.\u00a0Reputational risk**\n\n\nThis concerns the benefit sharing agreement of projects and the values of the partners, which Bedford prefers to assess by visiting them in person on the ground. Such site visits helps him to get to know who they are and how they think about the project, as well as their reputation on the ground, said Bedford.\n\n\n*Media access to the sponsored trip to Cambodia\u2019s Southern Cardamom and Keo Seima REDD+ projects was facilitated by Everland.*\n\n\n*Read more about the complex dynamics behind REDD+ projects in Cambodia in [this special report](https://www.eco-business.com/news/behind-cambodias-big-bet-on-redd-projects/).*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### \n Did you find this article useful?

The Science-Based Targets initiative is making the case for direct action on carbon management, and more business leaders are joining the movement. Those left behind may find themselves at risk of reputational damage unless they do their homework and approach carbon offsets with caution.\n\n\nScience-Based Targets: Follow the money\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nThe Science-Based Targets initiative [launched in 2015](https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2015/why-we-need-science-based-targets-cop21/57471) as a means to\u00a0steer the massive resources of private capital toward [effective climate solutions](https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2019/what-science-based-targets-mean-sports-and-entertainment-sector/83361) that are based on science. SBTi provides companies with the tools to set [net-zero carbon emission goals](https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2020/inevitability-sustainable-covid-19-recovery/120351) for their own operations and take effective steps toward reaching those goals.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cScience-based targets show companies and financial institutions how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent the worst effects of climate change,\u201d SBTi explains.\n\n\nThe organization\u2019s ability to muster financial firepower has been growing. It launched in partnership with business and environmental organizations including the\u00a0United Nations Global Compact,\u00a0CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), WRI (World Resources Institute) and WWF (the World Wide Fund for Nature). The We Mean Business Coalition also signed its members on to the initiative. And in 2021, SBTi closed out its net-zero [Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/business-ambition-for-1-5c/) after recruiting 1,000 companies.\n\n\nMembers of the campaign now represent more than $23 trillion in market capitalization, topping the entire GDP of the United States, according to SBTi.\n\n\nBy the end of last year, membership climbed to more than 4,000 companies accounting for more than 33 percent of the market capitalization of the entire global economy. The number includes those committed to setting targets as well as those that have already started the process.\n\n\nWhat a difference the U.S. makes\n--------------------------------\n\n\nAnother indication of the growing influence of the Science-Based Targets initiative\u00a0came on August 3 when the U.S. branch of the global organization [Ad Net Zero](https://adnetzero.com/) updated its recruiting numbers.\n\n\nThe Ad Net Zero parent organization formed in the U.K in 2020 with the goal of shifting consumer behavior, as well as helping the advertising industry reduce its carbon footprint. Last June, the organization announced that its members are required to commit to net-zero targets through the SBTi or a comparable alternative, such as the U.N. Race to Zero or The Climate Pledge.\n\n\nThe U.S. branch launched in February 2023 under a partnership with 18 leading industry organizations, including the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A\u2019s), the\u00a0Association of National Advertisers and\u00a0Interactive Advertising Bureau.\u00a0\n\n\nThe addition of a branch in the U.S. had a significant impact on the global reach of Ad Net Zero. As described by the U.S. branch, the global organization now covers a market that accounts for 45 percent of all advertising expenditures, with the U.S. market alone accounting for 40 percent.\n\n\nIn its latest update, [Ad Net Zero U.S.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/03/2718018/0/en/Ad-Net-Zero-US-Triples-Supporter-Base-In-First-Six-Months.html) listed brands and advertisers including Molson Coors, Uber, 51toCarbonZero, Acceptable Ads Committee, Brand Safety Institute, BSV Digital Displays, GMR, Integral Ad Science, LoopMe, woman- and LGBT-owned The Mixx, Murphy Cobb and Scope3 among its most recent members. The firm ThanksToYou also recently joined as its first member focusing on the Latin America market.\n\n\nThe power of collaboration\n--------------------------\n\n\nOf course, it is easy for companies to sign on to various pledges and letters of support to advocate for climate action. Following up with actual action steps is the hard part. But collaboration can help companies pool their resources and share best practices.\n\n\nThe companies that sign on to the Ad Net Zero organization are leveraging collaboration to maximize their effectiveness. In addition to insisting on concrete action steps consistent with science-based targets, Ad Net Zero draws on the diverse resources of its members and partners to provide industry-specific training and guidance.\n\n\nThe U.S. branch, for example, reports that its 70-strong membership includes global-level supporters and agency holding company subsidiaries. Together, the 70 members represent \u201ca spectrum of companies across the advertising ecosystem, from brands and agencies to production, advertising technology and media.\u201d\n\n\nTo the extent that the U.S. advertising industry of the 20th century steered consumer behavior toward carbon intensity, perhaps the 21st-century advertising model will become equally effective in the opposite direction.\n\n\nThe signs are pointing in the right direction. The global Ad Net Zero organization has partnered on education, measurement and training initiatives with other organizations including the World Advertising Federation\u2019s Global Alliance for Responsible Media and the U.K. nonprofit carbon calculator AdGreen. In addition, experienced members like Meta and Accenture are combining their expertise and communications resources.\n\n\nAd Net Zero also notes that eight of the 10 biggest advertising agencies in the world are members, along with three of the biggest brand advertisers. The top three companies in the ad tech sector are also represented. In 2021, these three companies alone serviced 74 percent of online ad spending, as well as 47 percent of all advertising dollars.\n\n\n\u201cAll for None\u201d and the potential power of carbon offsets\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs befits the creative resources at its disposal, the global Ad Net Zero organization adopted the clever slogan, \"All for None.\u201d By evoking the capability of each individual to make a difference in collaborative action toward net zero, that message can resonate with individual consumers as well as business leaders.\n\n\nThe consumer angle could offer a way forward for carbon offsets, which have increasingly come under fire for promising more than they can deliver.\n\n\nIn January, for example, The Guardian [reported on an investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) into the leading voluntary carbon offset standard Verra, in which the news organization concluded: \u201cForest carbon offsets approved by the world\u2019s leading certifier and used by Disney, Shell, Gucci and other big corporations are largely worthless and could make global heating worse.\u201d\n\n\nIn May, [CNBC reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/registries-in-carbon-offset-market-allowing-dubious-credits-report.html) on an analysis of almost 300 global carbon offset projects, accounting for 11 percent of all carbon credits sold to date. The analysis was undertaken by researchers at the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project. \u201cMajor registries in the carbon offset market are systematically over-crediting projects and delivering dubious carbon offsets, allowing some companies to claim more climate benefits than deserved,\u201d wrote Emma Newburger of CNBC in summary.\u00a0\n\n\nStill, global groups like the World Economic Forum [continue to support](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/carbon-offsetting-rainforest-sylvera/) carbon offsets, and the availability of new data could improve transparency and reliability. However, WEF also cautions that carbon accounting is \u201cfiendishly complex.\u201d\n\n\nCompanies seeking to reduce their carbon footprints are best advised to join the Science-Based Targets initiative\u00a0or a comparable organization. SBTi, for example, requires companies to take direct action within their own operations and value chains, without relying on offsets.\n\n\nOn the other hand, SBTi does not entirely exclude carbon offsets. \u201cOffsets are only considered to be an option for companies wanting to finance additional emission reductions beyond their science-based targets (SBT) or net-zero targets,\u201d\u00a0[the organization explains](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/faqs).\n\n\nThat leaves the door open for consumer engagement. Deloitte is among the analysts expecting more companies to use point-of-purchase offsets to promote their brands, with the help of apps and other user-friendly technologies.\n\n\n\u201cSeveral categories of consumer spending, including food, transportation and entertainment, could easily incorporate an option to purchase carbon offsets,\u201d Deloitte noted in a [July report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions.html#consumers-increase).\n\n\nIn that regard, the creative talent of the advertising industry could provide a loud, meaningful counterbalance to the [torrent of Republican-led attacks on ESG](https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2023/anti-woke-legislation/764301) (environmental, social and governance) business principles.\n\n\nRed flags about carbon offsets abound, but with sufficient transparency, reliability and user-friendliness, they could become an important way to stimulate individual action on climate change and help motivate consumers to adjust their purchasing habits to prioritize sustainability and circularity.\u00a0\n\n\n*Image credits:\u00a0[Markus Spiske](https://unsplash.com/photos/d7FbDJkJSFw)/Unsplash*\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Companies relying on carbon offsets may face reputational damage if they do not take direct action on carbon management, according to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

President Biden needs to run, not walk, away from the climate catastrophe of fossil fuels. Every time his administration approves another oil or gas project, it pushes us toward a more hellish future. Biden should use all his executive powers to speed the end of the fossil fuel era, because every tenth of a degree matters. Unless he does, these projects will perpetuate human suffering, environmental racism, and wildlife extinction. They\u2019ll just keep on cooking the planet.\u201d\n\nThe IRA failed to directly curb oil, gas and coal, which make up 85% of climate-heating pollution. Even if every renewable incentive in the Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion package [works perfectly](https://rhg.com/research/climate-clean-energy-inflation-reduction-act/), in tandem with existing measures the law will not meet Biden's commitment to cut carbon pollution 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Biden\u2019s use of executive powers to curb fossil fuels directly can make up this gap.\n\nThe IRA fails to stop U.S. exports of fossil fuels abroad. The United States is the leading exporter of oil and gas around the world. That production perpetuates pollution and environmental racism in communities at the site of extraction and export. The combustion abroad of U.S. fossil fuels also increases global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe Act also contained several fossil fuel poison pills, including new oil and gas leasing mandates and credits for dangerous and unproven technologies like carbon capture and storage. The IRA deal was struck with a promise to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) to greenlight the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which [passed](https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/debt-ceiling-deal-stains-bidens-legacy-on-climate-environmental-justice-2023-06-01/) in June.\n\nUnder Biden\u2019s [ordinary executive powers](https://climatepresident.org/Legal-Authority-for-Presidential-Climate-Action.pdf) and [emergency executive powers](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/energy-justice/pdfs/Climate-Emergency-Powers-Report.pdf), he can:\n\n* Curb fossil fuel production where the Inflation Reduction Act did not, including stopping all approvals of [new oil and gas projects](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/pdfs/Maritime-Administration-climate-petition-2022-11-10.pdf?_gl=1*10cnd9w*_gcl_au*MTIzNjQ3Nzg1NC4xNjgyMjgyNjMz), [phasing out](https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/biden-administration-rejects-calls-to-phase-out-oil-gas-on-public-lands-by-2035-2023-06-29/?_gl=1*1ng2gzb*_gcl_au*MTQ4NDgyMjg4MS4xNjg5NjIwMTEz) the production of oil, gas and coal on our public lands and waters, and halting fossil fuel exports.\n* Stop the hundreds of billions of dollars in public and private finance for fossil fuel projects abroad through his powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n* Direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies to deploy distributed energy systems, like community and rooftop solar, with post-disaster funds and IRA financing to maximize resilient and affordable clean energy systems.\n* Declare heat as a major disaster event under the Stafford Act. This will allow states to access more heat-relief funds for things like cooling and water centers in areas accessible to those most affected by heat, including poor and unhoused people, as well as agricultural and other workers.\n\nOn Sept. 17 thousands of people will participate in the [March to End Fossil Fuels](https://www.endfossilfuels.us/), urging Biden to declare a climate emergency and use all his executive powers to speed the end of the fossil fuel era. The New York City march is part of a [mass global escalation to end fossil fuels](https://fightfossilfuels.net/), with mobilizations occurring around the world on Sept. 15.\n\nThe mass mobilizations support the U.N.

Sent to your inbox every other Wednesday.\n\n**NO TIMELINES:** Indigenous leaders and Amazon experts told Carbon Brief that they are worried about the implementation of the declaration due to the lack of specific targets. Prof David Lapola, an ecologist at the State University of Campinas in Brazil, said: \u201cWe are always expecting more than these big summits tend to deliver for us in terms of concrete measures or actions.\u201d But he and other experts noted that bringing these countries together to discuss the Amazon is an achievement in itself. Fany Kuiru, a Colombian Indigenous leader, told Carbon Brief: \u201cIf governments do not work hand in hand with Indigenous peoples, local communities and other sectors that live in the Amazon, we will not be able to materialise the declaration into real actions.\u201d\n\n\n**ECUADOR OIL VOTE:** Elsewhere in the Amazon basin, Ecuadorians will soon vote in a binding referendum on whether they want oil drilling to continue in a national park \u201cdeep in the northern Amazon rainforest\u201d, [Mongabay](https://news.mongabay.com/2023/08/can-upcoming-referendum-in-ecuador-stop-oil-drilling-in-yasuni-national-park/) reported. On 20 August, voters will take to the polls to decide on the future of oil drilling in Yasun\u00ed National Park, which has \u201clong been considered one of the most biodiverse [areas] on the planet\u201d, the outlet said. A second referendum will also take place to decide the future of mining in the Andean Choc\u00f3 forest. The forest is designated as a UNESCO biosphere reserve, but there are currently a dozen mining concessions \u201cin the early stages of exploration in the region\u201d. The two referendums are scheduled on the same day as the country\u2019s next presidential election.\u00a0\n\n\n### **Hawaii\u2019s wildfire aftermath**\n\n\n**\u2018ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE\u2019:** The death toll from last week\u2019s wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui has reached 106, with about one-third of the affected area searched, [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/15/us/hawaii-maui-wildfires-death-toll-tuesday/index.html) reported. The fires are already the deadliest to hit the US in more than a century. \u201cExperts fear a broader environmental catastrophe is only just starting to unfold,\u201d the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/11/maui-fires-environmental-impact/) wrote, pointing to \u201cimpacts on native plants and animals that aren\u2019t adapted to thrive with fire\u201d. The newspaper added that the native flora and fauna \u201ccarry cultural significance to Indigenous Hawaiians, support the local economy and contribute to driving tourism to the islands\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\n**WATER WORRIES:** Toxic runoff, debris and ash from the fires could all harm the island\u2019s coral reefs, which are some of the oldest in the state, the Washington Post reported. It noted that \u201cthe fires come at a time when Hawaii\u2019s coral reefs are already stressed\u201d by bleaching, coastal development and pollution. The US Coast Guard is now turning its attention \u201cto cleaning up debris and pollution in the sea\u201d, the [Honolulu Star Advertiser](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/08/15/hawaii-news/focus-moving-to-pollution-water-hazards-on-maui-coast-guard-says/) wrote, adding that the fires have left the waterfront \u201clittered with debris and potential toxic leaks\u201d. Fresh water continues to be a concern as well, as \u201can unsafe water advisory continues to be in effect\u201d for several parts of the island, the [Maui News](https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2023/08/unsafe-water-advisory-still-in-effect/) wrote. It added: \u201cResidents are unable to treat the water in any way to make it safe.\u201d\n\n\n**INVASIVE GRASSES:** The Washington Post wrote that the wildfires \u201cwere exacerbated by a dried-out landscape and the spread of flammable invasive grasses across abandoned farm fields\u201d. It added that non-native grasses can \u201cbounce back more easily after a blaze, crowding out the regrowth of native species and creating more fuel for the next fire\u201d. Experts told the newspaper that it will take time to understand if native plants will be able to recover. The interim manager of the Maui Invasive Species Committee, Teya Penniman, wrote in the [Maui News](https://www.mauinews.com/news/community-news/2023/08/stopping-wildfires-parallels-containing-invasive-species/) that \u201cefforts to restore native ecosystems impacted by invasive species can\u2019t reset the clock \u2013 we can never truly regain what was lost\u201d. She added: \u201cBut it\u2019s worth it to try.\u201d\n\n\n**CLIMATE CONNECTION:** Many outlets made the connection between the wildfires and climate change, pointing to a warming and drying climate that left the island susceptible. The [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/hawaii-wildfires-warning-climate-change/674974/) wrote: \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t need more reminders that climate change is accelerating. But we\u2019re going to keep getting them.\u201d The magazine added that \u201cwe are running out of time to protect ourselves\u201d and \u201cwhen something beautiful burns, you can never truly get it back\u201d. [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02571-z) wrote that \u201cwildfires are not new to Hawaii\u201d but they are \u201cgetting worse and more frequent\u201d. It added that forecasters \u201cwere predicting below average precipitation and drought for Hawaii\u201d in May. Climate data is particularly lacking in Hawaii, the publication added, as it is the \u201conly state without a dedicated climate division within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u201d.\n\n\n### **Indonesia peat investigation**\n\n\n**RESTORATION DOUBTS:** Large areas of \u201crestored\u201d peatland in Indonesia may be more vulnerable to burning than the government has acknowledged, according to a new investigation by the [Gecko Project](https://thegeckoproject.org/articles/success-of-indonesian-peatland-restoration-in-doubt-as-fire-season-sets-in/). The Indonesian government has claimed that up to 3.66m hectares of peatland have been restored, meaning the peat has been rewetted in order to reduce fire risk. But the investigative journalism nonprofit found that, based on government data, the average area registered as rewetted has stayed at around 2.7m hectares since 2018 \u201cand has not increased over time\u201d. The outlet said the government appeared to use a narrow definition of \u201crestoration\u201d but that, even by their definition, the restored areas \u201chave never reached the figures cited in official documentation and may in fact be far lower\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\n**\u2018DEVASTATING\u2019 FIRES:** In [2015](https://www.carbonbrief.org/indonesian-fires-now-on-a-par-with-brazils-total-annual-emissions/), a \u201cnotorious wildfire season\u201d burned through hundreds of thousands of hectares of Indonesia\u2019s tropical peatlands and resulted in a \u201cnoxious haze\u201d blamed for sickening hundreds of thousands of people in south-east Asia, the Gecko Project said. Years of draining peatlands for agricultural development left them vulnerable to decomposition and burning. The \u201cdevastating\u201d 2015 fires prompted the country\u2019s president to launch an \u201cambitious plan to restore the nation\u2019s peatlands\u201d, the nonprofit wrote. The government\u2019s \u201cclaims to have made huge progress\u201d on this are \u201cnot supported\u201d by publicly available data, it added.\u00a0\n\n\n**EL NI\u00d1O RISKS:** The Gecko Project found multiple peatland areas where water levels were consistently lower than required for the government\u2019s restoration threshold. This highlighted a \u201cpossibly heightened fire risk as this year\u2019s [El Ni\u00f1o](https://www.carbonbrief.org/state-of-the-climate-growing-el-nino-threatens-more-extreme-heat-in-2023/) event progresses\u201d, the outlet said. Prof David Taylor, a peatland expert at the National University of Singapore, added: \u201cBig El Ni\u00f1os over the last thirty years or so have been associated with drought here in south-east Asia [and with] peatland fires\u2026I think it\u2019s going to be a test of claims that have been made that these peatlands have been restored.\u201d The Gecko Project said that the Indonesian ministry of environment and forestry did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0\n\n\n**News and views**\n==================\n\n\n**COLD TURKEY:** Turkey has officially withdrawn as the host of COP16, the UN biodiversity summit set to take place next autumn, according to a statement released by the [Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int/doc/notifications/2023/ntf-2023-082-cop16-en.pdf). The statement cited the three earthquakes that devastated the country in February 2023 as the reason for the move. The [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/03/turkey-withdraws-as-host-un-cop16-biodiversity-summit-blaming-earthquakes) wrote that the upcoming summit \u201cwill be an important test of international commitment to the ambitious targets\u201d agreed upon at last year\u2019s COP15, \u201cwhich need to be met by the end of the decade\u201d. It further noted that \u201cinformal talks on progress\u201d will occur at the COP28 climate summit, which begins in Dubai in late November.\n\n\n**MASS BLEACHING:** Coral reefs across the world \u2013 from China to the Caribbean \u2013 are at high risk of bleaching, according to the latest [Coral Reef Watch](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/bleachingoutlook_cfs/index.php) report from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Coral Reef Watch coordinator Dr Derek Manzello told the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/11/coral-bleaching-central-america): \u201cWe are marching towards a Caribbean-wide coral bleaching event in the next month if things don\u2019t change.\u201d The newspaper added that many of these regions are still weeks away from when they typically reach peak temperatures, \u201csuggesting the situation could worsen without sustained cloudy weather or major storms\u201d. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s [ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-09/mass-coral-bleaching-halts-great-barrier-reef-recovery/102706194) covered the newly released 2022 Great Barrier Reef report card, which found that bleaching on the reef occurred last year for the first time during a La Ni\u00f1a episode, which is characterised by cooler ocean temperatures off Australia. While not as deadly as previous bleaching events, it \u201cdid enough damage to counteract gains\u201d, the outlet wrote.\n\n\n**FOREST LAW FLAK:** [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-changes-forest-conservation-law-draw-flak-environmentalists-2023-08-03/) reported that the Indian government\u2019s changes to a 1980 law aimed at reducing deforestation \u201cis drawing protests from environmental activists who fear the changes will lead to unchecked commercial activity and infrastructure development in green areas\u201d. Some activists are \u201cexploring a legal challenge\u201d, while the government is maintaining the position that the changes are vital \u201cto the livelihood aspirations of the local communities\u201d. The newswire added: \u201cOpponents say India\u2019s new law will also change how it defines forests, and so it will apply to fewer green zones, leading to about 20-28% of existing forest cover losing regulatory protection.\u201d\n\n\n**COVERT CARBON CONTRACT:** The west African country of Liberia is \u201cset to concede 10% of its territory\u201d to a United Arab Emirates-based company that will use the 1m hectares of forest to generate carbon credits, [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2023/08/02/liberia-set-to-concede-10-of-its-territory-to-emirati-company-for-carbon-credit-production_6077402_124.html) reported. The agreement will be officially announced at COP28, the newspaper added. According to Le Monde, the \u201csecretly negotiated contract is raising serious concerns\u201d about the rights of the landowners and populations living in the territory earmarked for conservation. [Africa Times](https://africatimes.com/2023/08/04/emirati-firms-carbon-credit-deal-sparks-scrutiny-over-liberias-forests/) wrote that \u201cit\u2019s not clear how a new deal would affect\u201d an existing agreement between Liberia and Norway for forest conservation.\u00a0\n\n\n**CASH FOR WILDLIFE:** A large protected area in Mozambique is \u201cthriving\u201d, partly due to local involvement in wildlife conservation, [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/niassa-reserve-mozambique-conservation-success) reported. The outlet called the Niassa Special Reserve, which is larger than the country of Switzerland, \u201cone of the biggest African wildernesses the world has never heard of\u201d. The magazine detailed one project that aimed to boost community income, food production and local needs, while also including people in conservation projects. The organisation that runs the project pays money into a fund to reward \u201cwildlife-friendly behaviour\u201d \u2013 $8 for every lion or elephant spotted by a tourist, for example. \u201cVillagers are encouraged to protect wildlife and habitat. The more animals, the more tourism dollars, the rationale goes,\u201d National Geographic said.\u00a0\n\n\n**WYE OH WYE:** The largest poultry supplier in the River Wye\u2019s catchment area, which covers more than 4,000 square kilometres across the England-Wales border, will no longer sell poultry litter \u201cto be used as fertiliser on fields within the river catchment because of the impact it has on water quality\u201d, [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-66466562?zephr-modal-register-exp1-meter2) reported. The outlet wrote that \u201c24m chickens are farmed and their waste is spread as fertiliser, but some of it washes into the river when it rains\u201d, leading to the recent downgrading of the river\u2019s status by Natural England. [Farmers Weekly](https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/poultry/chicken-processor-avara-moves-to-help-clean-up-the-river-wye) added: \u201cThe move has received a \u2018cautious welcome\u2019 from environmental campaigners.\u201d A separate [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-66440390) piece quoted the head of the Welsh farmers\u2019 union as saying that halting production \u201cis not the method for addressing these issues\u201d, but pointed out that research has shown that \u201cup to 70% of the phosphate load in the River Wye originates from agriculture\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\n**Watch, read, listen**\n=======================\n\n\n**HAWAIIAN WILDFIRES:** The[Heated](https://heated.world/p/lahaina-used-to-be-wetland) newsletter interviewed the national director of the Green New Deal Network, an Indigenous Hawaiian, about the root causes of the recent wildfires \u2013 and how to rebuild.\n\n\n**OCEAN POWER:** A piece in [Energy Monitor](https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/carbon-removal/blue-carbon-do-oceans-hold-the-key-to-carbon-removal/) looked at \u201cblue carbon\u201d and its possibilities \u2013\u00a0 and limitations \u2013 for carbon removal.\u00a0\n\n\n**NEW IPCC HEAD:** The new chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Prof Jim Skea, spoke to the BBC\u2019s the [Climate Question](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct5bkc) podcast about climate concerns and the challenges ahead for the scientific body.\u00a0\n\n\n**AMAZON\u2019S UNDERWORLD:** An investigative collaboration by [InfoAmazonia](https://amazonunderworld.org/) explored the \u201cdevastating impact\u201d of illegal mining and drug trafficking on the Amazon.\n\n\n**New science**\n===============\n\n\n[**Enumerating soil biodiversity**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304663120)  \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n\n\nNew research found that soil could be the \u201cmost biodiverse singular habitat\u201d, housing around 59% of species on the planet. Researchers reviewed biodiversity literature around global species predictions to identify the different estimates of global and soil-specific species richness. The researchers said their estimates showed approximately two times greater soil biodiversity than previous studies. The study noted that soil biodiversity research is \u201chighly fragmented and speculative\u201d, and therefore these estimates are an initial attempt to bring efforts together and highlight future knowledge gaps. The figures provide \u201ca staggering enumeration to the value of conserving soil biodiversity\u201d, the study authors wrote.\u00a0\n\n\n[**Pathways framework identifies wildfire impacts on agriculture**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00803-z)  \nNature Food\n\n\nA new study identified three main pathways through which wildfires impact agricultural resources, labour and products. Researchers performed an \u201cextensive\u201d review of the scientific literature, reports and news articles. They found that agriculture can be harmed through a \u201cdirect\u201d pathway, such as by damage to livestock or cropland; through a \u201cdownwind\u201d pathway, such as by particulate matter and other pollutants; or through a \u201cdownstream\u201d pathway, such as by impacting water quality. The authors wrote that the work \u201chighlight[s] the complexity of wildfire-agriculture interactions and the need for collaborative, systems-oriented research\u201d to better understand wildfire-agriculture interactions and \u201cinform the adaptation of agricultural systems to an increasingly fire-prone future\u201d.\n\n\n[**Coral reefs benefit from reduced land-sea impacts under ocean warming**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06394-w)  \nNature\n\n\nCoral reef ecosystems are being \u201cfundamentally restructured\u201d by human impacts and marine heatwaves, according to a new study. Researchers developed a 20-year dataset spanning the time before, during and after an \u201cunprecedented\u201d marine heatwave in Hawaii which took place from 2014-16 to analyse human impacts on land and sea and the environmental factors known to affect coral reefs. The findings showed that mitigating local human impacts on the land and sea simultaneously can promote reef persistence after severe heat stress and also reduce coral loss during a marine heatwave. The researchers concluded that actions to support coral reef resilience, alongside reducing greenhouse gas emissions, \u201cmay buy reefs more time to adapt and persist into the future\u201d.\n\n\n**In the diary**\n================\n\n\n\n* **18-19 August:** [38th UN-Water meeting](https://sdg.iisd.org/events/38th-un-water-meeting/) | Stockholm, Sweden\n* **22-26 August:** [Seventh assembly of the Global Environment Facility](https://www.thegef.org/events/seventh-gef-assembly) | Vancouver, Canada\n* **28 August-2 September:** [10th session of the Plenary of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service](https://www.ipbes.net/notification/save_the_date_IPBES10) | Bonn, Germany\n\n\n\n*Cropped is researched and written by* [*Dr Giuliana Viglione*](https://www.carbonbrief.org/author/giulianaviglione)*,* [*Aruna Chandrasekhar*](https://www.carbonbrief.org/author/arunachandrasekhar)*,* [*Daisy Dunne*](https://www.carbonbrief.org/author/daisydunne)*,* [*Orla Dwyer*](https://www.carbonbrief.org/author/orladwyer/) *and* [*Yanine Quiroz*](https://www.carbonbrief.org/author/yanine-quiroz/)*.

Kathy Catsor (D-FL) in the State Dining Room of the White House August 16, 2022 in Washington, DC.\n\n\n\n \n Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n \n \n\n\n\nThe law directs at least $369 billion \u2013 [and potentially much more](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/business/ira-climate-tax-breaks-biden.html) \u2013 toward incentives for nearly every sector of the economy to adopt renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies. \n\n The goal is to make alternatives cheaper \u2013 and more attractive \u2013 than fossil fuels, said Jesse Jenkins, a professor at Princeton University who advised on the law.\n\n \"What the Inflation Reduction Act effectively does, is it aligns the full financial might of the federal government behind the push towards cleaner energy resources,\" Jenkins said. \"In essence, it puts clean energy on sale for households and businesses and industries all over the country.\" \n\n The law faces opposition among Republican lawmakers. It passed along party lines, with only Democrats voting in favor. Since Republicans gained control of the U.S. House this year, many have [called for repealing its incentives](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/20/house-gop-debt-limit-plan-inflation-reduction-act-00092891), arguing the price tag is too high, and transitioning away from fossil fuels shouldn't be a priority. \n\n \n\n\nHere are three takeaways as the first major U.S. climate policy turns one. \n\n ### \"Rocket fuel\" for renewable energy, but hurdles remain\n\n Nearly $200 billion in tax credits at the center of the IRA aim to clean up the two biggest sources of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions: transportation and power plants.\n\n The incentives are meant to help speed the transition to electric vehicles and boost the deployment of low-carbon energy like wind and solar power, while also encouraging companies to build those vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines in the U.S. \n\n One year in, that's starting to happen, say analysts and industry representatives.\n\n \"The IRA really has acted like rocket fuel across every segment and corner of our industry,\" Heather O'Neill, head of the trade group Advanced Energy United, told reporters Monday.\n\n Projects like wind and solar farms take years of planning, so it's too soon to see the law driving new power onto the grid, said Chris Seiple at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.But Wood Mackenzie estimates the amount of renewable power added to the grid each year will roughly triple by 2030 as a result of the IRA, he said. \n\n \"This is legislation that is going to result in a radical transformation of the electric supply in the United States,\" Seiple said.\n\n Meanwhile, companies have issued a steady stream of announcements for new factories in the U.S., especially for electric vehicles, batteries, and solar panel components. The vast majority of solar and battery manufacturing currently takes place outside the U.S., [much](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/16/business/china-ev-battery.html) [of it](https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary) in China.\n\n But both automakers and renewable energy developers face major challenges.\n\n [Auto workers are worried](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/26/1189928190/uaw-union-talks-auto-workers-trump-biden-shawn-fain-2024) they'll be left behind in the transition to electric vehicles. Wind and solar developers say their projects face increasing opposition from local communities, some of it [fueled by misinformation](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/16/1164050912/activists-spread-misleading-information-to-fight-solar). The electric grid is also struggling to accommodate new projects, with many already [waiting years](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176462647/green-energy-transmission-queue-power-grid-wind-solar) for permission to connect.\n\n \n\n\nGregory Wetstone, president and chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy, an industry trade group, said on some level he welcomes the current challenges. They're a result, he said, of \"trying to get so much done really rapidly, which is the pace we need to go to address the climate crisis.\"\n\n ### There's money to \"electrify everything\" \u2013 but it may roll out slowly\n\n Another focus of the law? You. Or at least your car, your gas stove and your furnace. \n\n The Inflation Reduction Act makes billions of dollars available to help households switch to electric vehicles, replace fossil fuel-powered heating and cooling systems with more efficient electric [heat pumps](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/01/1166267716/6-things-to-know-about-heat-pumps-a-climate-solution-in-a-box#:~:text=Heat%20pumps%20can%20work%20for,cool%20air%20on%20hot%20days.), install solar panels and insulate homes.\n\n The law makes the electrification of American households the \"hinge point\" of U.S. climate policy, said Ari Matusiak, the chief executive officer of Rewiring America, a nonprofit campaigning to cut household emissions, which offers an [online guide](https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/) to the subsidies. \n\n Some of the money is available now, as credits when you file your tax return. For instance, the law offers a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of certain electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs. \n\n Credits, however, often cover only a fraction of the cost of major retrofits, like installing a heat pump. \n\n Some benefits for low- and moderate-income households may not become available for months or years. The law creates a rebate program to reduce the up-front cost of electric appliances and home retrofits for households making up to a certain amount. Those programs will be administered by states, which have indicated it will take some time to staff up. Virginia's state department of energy [has said](https://whro.org/news/local-news/40483-electric-cars-solar-panels-and-more-here-s-how-virginians-can-access-millions-through-the-inflation-reduction-act) it could take one or two years before the program is up and running.\n\n ### Yes, the law reduces U.S. climate impact. But it's not enough.\n\n Studies indicate the IRA will help significantly reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The think tank Rhodium Group [found](https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2023/) the IRA could cut emissions up to 48% from their peak by 2035.\n\n \n\n\nThe act still falls short of the U.S. commitment under the international Paris Agreement, to cut emissions in half from their 2005 peak by 2030. The U.S. has committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, which means contributing no new greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere.\n\n [Scientists say](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) those targets are necessary to limit warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels, and avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.\n\n The Biden administration is rolling out other efforts to close the gap. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed [new rules](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/11/1169967646/an-epa-proposal-to-almost-eliminate-climate-pollution-from-power-plants) to cut emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants, and to restrict emissions of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas.\n\n Sonia Aggarwal is now the chief executive officer of the California-based environmental policy firm Energy Innovation. She says two things are true: the U.S. is moving faster than seemed possible just a few years ago. And it's still not fast enough. \n\n But she sees the IRA ushering in a new phase. \n\n \"We have completely changed direction on our energy policy such that we will actually have a chance to meet our climate goals, which certainly was not the case even just a couple of years ago,\" Aggarwal said. \n\n *NPR's Camila Domonoske contributed to this reporting.* \n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the cost of installing rooftop solar panels by 30%, which will in turn lower monthly electricity bills.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The tax credits will result in cost reduction and savings for consumers."}, {"summary": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) sets expansive goals to dramatically decrease the U.S. contribution to climate change by slashing greenhouse gas emissions and shifting the economy away from fossil fuels.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The act aims to address climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels."}, {"summary": "The IRA provides incentives of at least $369 billion to encourage adoption of renewable energy and low-carbon technologies, making them more affordable and attractive than fossil fuels.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The incentives aim to promote the use of clean energy resources throughout the country."}, {"summary": "The IRA has acted as 'rocket fuel' for the renewable energy industry, resulting in announcements for new factories in the U.S. and an expected tripling of renewable power added to the grid by 2030.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The act has boosted the renewable energy industry and is expected to increase renewable power generation."}, {"summary": "The law makes funds available to help households switch to electric vehicles, replace fossil fuel-powered heating and cooling systems, install solar panels, and insulate homes, but major retrofits may still be costly.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The availability of funds for household electrification may vary, and major retrofits may still be expensive."}, {"summary": "The IRA will help reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, but it falls short of the U.S. commitment under the Paris Agreement and the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "While the act helps reduce emissions, it does not fully meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement."}, {"summary": "The U.S. is making progress in addressing climate change, but more needs to be done to meet climate goals.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Further efforts are required to fully meet climate goals and limit the impacts of climate change."}], "semantic_commentary": "Article relates to Intent: Selling carbon credits to organizations aiming to reduce carbon emissions.\nInsightful Commentary: Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes renewable energy adoption.", "sentiment_score": 0.5714285714285714, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions the installation of rooftop solar panels, which is a system that removes carbon from the atmosphere."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions incentives and funds provided by the Inflation Reduction Act to encourage the adoption of renewable energy and low-carbon technologies, indicating a commitment to reducing carbon emissions."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions climate goals and the U.S. commitment under the Paris Agreement, which are related to carbon news."}]}, {"source": "Financial Times", "link": "https://www.ft.com/content/2bcb3332-a557-42f9-9d09-71c09a261db8", "title": "Letter: UK is missing a big opportunity in voluntary carbon markets | Financial Times", "content": "\n\n### What is included in my trial?\n\n\nDuring your trial you will have complete digital access to FT.com with everything in both of our Standard Digital and Premium Digital packages.\n\n\nStandard Digital includes access to a wealth of global news, analysis and expert opinion.

I think actually there's agreement on it,\" the British PM told ITV Wednesday, when asked if he would put the emissions target to a referendum.\n\n\nThe U.K.'s pledge to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 has been the [subject of much debate](https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-climate-consensus-net-zero-green-policy/) lately. While still committed to the legally-binding headline target, Sunak has called for a \"pragmatic and proportionate\" approach to cutting emissions and made a show of expressing his support for motorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome in his party want Sunak to go further, citing the impact of a switch to clean energy on voters already hit by rising prices. Those calling for a rethink were boosted by a recent narrow London by-election win for Tories who campaigned against the expansion of a clean air plan.\n\n \n### \n \n You may like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[UK banks shun companies trading with Ukraine](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-bank-close-accounts-british-smes-trading-with-ukraine/)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Sebastian Whale](https://www.politico.eu/author/sebastian-whale/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Former Finnish PM Alexander Stubb to run for president](https://www.politico.eu/article/former-finland-pm-alexander-stubb-to-run-for-president/)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Elisa Braun](https://www.politico.eu/author/elisa-braun/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Russia lifts rates to 12 percent to boost ruble](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-lifts-rates-to-12-percent-to-boost-ruble/)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n \n By \n [Izabella Kaminska](https://www.politico.eu/author/izabella-kaminska/) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Brexit Party leader Farage on Wednesday renewed his longstanding call for the government to put the target to a referendum, telling [the Telegraph newspaper](https://twitter.com/dominicpenna/status/1691718625617485926?s=46&t=ad99pZjtYc1b_NC_IsMSfQ) the target is \"unrealistic, unaffordable, and our politicians, to date, are unaccountable.\" \n\n\n\"The only way we'll get change is through a referendum, just like with the EU,\" he argued.\n\n\nAsked directly about such calls for a referendum, Sunak said Brits were already behind the target.\n\n\n\"I think most people are committed to getting to net zero but getting there in a proportion and pragmatic way ...

Only 4% believe their potentially detrimental impact would outweigh their positive impact.\n\n\n**SEE:** [**Sustainability**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/gartner-top-trends-list/) **tops Gartner\u2019s 2023 strategic tech trends list (TechRepublic)**\n\n\n\u201cOne of the things I would highlight is that the tech industry has been very forward on the sustainability agenda,\u201d said John Grant, sustainability expert, author and co-founder and former head of strategy at London creative shop St Luke\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cCompanies including Microsoft have said they are going to remit all the carbon they have ever emitted historically,\u201d he said, adding that Spotify is also a big investor in carbon removal technology. \u201cGenerally, tech companies are trying to be really good actors in this space.\u201d\n\n\nNet zero, carbon neutral, carbon free or carbon negative?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n### Net zero\n\n\nThe World Economic Forum [defines net zero](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/net-zero-emissions-cop26-climate-change/) pretty much the way it sounds: taking out what you put into the atmosphere, or as the WEF puts it, \u201cCarbon dioxide emissions are still generated, but an equal amount of carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere as is released into it, resulting in zero increase in net emissions.\u201d\n\n\n### Carbon neutral or carbon free, similar but\u2026\n\n\nSome disambiguation from [Energy Tracker Asia](https://energytracker.asia/carbon-neutral-vs-carbon-free-whats-the-difference/) helps: The regional energy guide describes carbon neutral as a balancing act between greenhouse gas emissions through offsetting an equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere, usually through buying carbon credits.\n\n\n**SEE: How about hardware? Check out how** [**semiconductor makers**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/deloitte-semiconductors-sustainability/) **are going beyond carbon offsets (TechRepublic)**\n\n\nCarbon free, a more challenging proposition, means directly reducing emissions to zero. \u201cFor example, if a country or company is carbon-free, all the energy and electricity comes from renewable sources, like wind or solar,\u201d the group said, noting that Washington, California, New Mexico and Hawaii have carbon-free targets in place requiring 100% clean or renewable electricity.\n\n\n### Carbon negative\n\n\n\n### More about Innovation\n\n\n* [ChatGPT cheat sheet: Complete guide for 2023](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/chatgpt-cheat-sheet/)\n* [GPT-4 cheat sheet: What is GPT-4, and what is it capable of?](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/gpt-4-cheat-sheet/)\n* [7 Best AI Art Generators of 2023](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/best-ai-art-generators/)\n* [Hiring kit: Prompt engineer](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/hiring-kit-prompt-engineer/)\n\n\n\nHow about carbon negative, which companies like [Microsoft](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/un-global-climate-action-awards/climate-neutral-now/microsoft-carbon-negative-goal) have committed to? Carbon offset company [Terrapass](https://terrapass.com/) explained in a blog that a carbon negative would mean, in theory, emitting less than zero carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) greenhouse gasses. \u201cSince it is impossible to emit a negative amount of carbon (or any other physical substance), being carbon negative refers to the net emissions you create. To be carbon negative means to offset more carbon, through carbon capture, sequestration or avoidance, than you contribute to the environment.\u201d\n\n\n### Scope 1,2, 3 carbon emission schedule\n\n\nMany companies, tech and otherwise, adopted carbon-reduction targets based on the [Scope 1, 2 and 3](https://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/greenhouse-gases-epa) carbon emission schedule (**Figure B**) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This three-part agenda defines emissions by government entities:\n\n\n* **Scope 1:** A company\u2019s own emissions from on-site combustion, processes, transportation, etc.\n* **Scope 2:** Indirect emissions from the sources of generated power consumed by a company.\n* **Scope 3:** Emissions associated with water treatment, employee travel and waste disposal.\n\n\n**Figure B**\n\n\n![Visual description of Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions.](https://www.techrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tr-2023-08-16-Figure.B.Sustainability-770x579.jpeg)Visual description of Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions.

The company has approached sustainability from several fronts, including applying AI to search in order to provide carbon-emissions data to travelers. In addition, Google plans to invest in carbon removal solutions to neutralize emissions with a goal of running on carbon-free energy worldwide on every grid it uses by 2030.\n\n\nThe company [reported](https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/) that last year it achieved 64% carbon-free energy globally. The company said it consumed around 7 GW of renewable energy globally last year (**Figure C**).\n\n\n**Figure C**\n\n\n![An example of an hourly heat map from a Google data center.

The maps provide hourly visuals on the proportion of energy it consumes that are from wind, solar and other green sources. Image: Google\nGrant pointed out that Google managed to drop the energy used to cool its data centers by up to 40% [by using AI developed by DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-by-40), and for years has been buying renewable energy from wind farms physically close to its data centers. He added, \u201cThese are key projects Google is including in its calculation of how to reduce their carbon emissions.\u201d\n\n\nMicrosoft launched Cloud for Sustainability, cut operational emissions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMicrosoft, which set its first carbon emission goals in 2009 and was carbon neutral in 2012, committed in 2020 to being [carbon negative by 2030](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/). They said that by 2030 it will remove more carbon than it emits, \u201cSetting us on a path to remove by 2050 all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded.\u201d\n\n\nThe company said its [Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability/cloud) helps users take such actions as:\n\n\n* Unify their data intelligence around Scope 1, 2 and 3 energy use goals.\n* Build a sustainable IT infrastructure.\n* Create green end-to-end value chains.\n* Meet other environmental, social and governance goals.\n* Innovate around resilience and other sustainable business models.\n\n\nIn [Microsoft\u2019s most recent environmental sustainability report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report), the company said that In 2022, when business grew by 18%, its overall emissions declined by 0.5%. This is in part because of a 22.7% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 (operational) emissions.\n\n\nApple is using its Daisy robot to turn phones to dust\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nApple, which has [committed to being carbon neutral by 2030](https://www.apple.com/environment/), has been using technological innovations such as its [Daisy](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apple-expands-the-use-of-recycled-materials-across-its-products/) robot to recycle basic materials.In April 2023, [Apple reported progress on its climate goals](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/04/apple-announces-major-progress-toward-climate-goals-ahead-of-earth-day/), which included:\n\n\n* It had decreased its carbon footprint by over 45% since 2015.\n* It had directed over 40,000 metric tons of electronic scrap toward recycling.\n* 20% of all materials shipped in its products came from recycled sources. Apple said the majority of aluminum in its products are recycled, and that it employs a new, zero-carbon smelting process.\n\n\n\u201cApple is one of the most aggressive companies in the world in terms of reclaiming minerals,\u201d said Grant. \u201cHowever, while they are using their Daisy robots to grind up phones to reclaim the component materials, there are numerous regulations preventing e-waste from being moved across borders. So the collection and delivery of materials is proving very difficult,\u201d he said. This year, [Apple pledged to use 100% recycled cobalt batteries by 2025](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/04/apple-will-use-100-percent-recycled-cobalt-in-batteries-by-2025/).\n\n\n**SEE:** [**Sustainable solutions**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/tech-impact-reduce-single-use-plastics/) **for tacking plastic waste (TechRepublic)**\n\n\nCloud and security firms looking to greener processes\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMost cloud, software-as-a-service and security firms are looking at ways to reduce their hardware and server farm footprints through renewable sources of energy and recycling plans, partnerships and consumer programs. Below we focus on efforts from Cisco, Akamai, WithSecure and Gigamon.\n\n\n### Cisco aims for net zero by 2040\n\n\nIn 2021, [Cisco announced its goal to be net zero by 2040](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/csr/environmental-sustainability/net-zero.html), including products, operations and supply chain. The company\u2019s plan aligns with Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions targets, using 2019 as a benchmark.\n\n\nThe company is aiming for:\n\n\n* 90% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse emissions by 2025. Cisco said it would neutralize any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere.\n* 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution and use of sold products by 2030.\n* Net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2040.\n\n\n### Akamai aims for 100% renewable energy and waste recycling\n\n\nIn 2021, cloud services and web security company Akamai Technologies said 50% of its energy needs had already been met by renewable sources. [Akamai also announced 2030 sustainability goals](https://www.akamai.com/newsroom/press-release/akamai-announces-new-2030-sustainability-goals) toward 100% renewable energy at data centers, offices, network program partners and other sources of electricity, and said it will use \u201cattestable and traceable sources of renewable energy certificates\u201d to reach them.\n\n\nOne focus is on efficiency of its edge platform, which Akamai characterized as its greatest point of energy consumption, comprising approximately 325,000 servers in more than 135 countries and nearly 1,435 networks around the world as of 2021. In addition, Akamai announced a global expansion of its 100% electronic waste recycling program.\n\n\n### WithSecure launches W/Sustainability initiative\n\n\nEarlier this year, threat intelligence and response firm WithSecure launched [W/Sustainability](https://www.withsecure.com/en/about-us/corporate-responsibility), designed to make sustainability and transparency part of its strategy and operations, including a green coding initiative to lower energy consumed by software.\n\n\n### Gigamon creates power savings calculator\n\n\n[Gigamon recently launched an Energy Savings Calculator](https://blog.gigamon.com/2023/05/16/put-your-carbonivore-data-center-on-a-diet/) as part of its [Network Efficiency Appraisal Team](https://go.gigamon.com/NEAT) to get customers to cut power consumption, carbon footprint and costs associated with data centers by as much as 87% over five years. The calculator looks at the volume of network traffic sent to tools and the annual growth rate in network traffic to see where energy efficiencies are achievable.\n\n\nAre ecommerce and cloud services like eBay and AWS inherently sustainable?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGrant asserted that the business models of ecommerce and cloud services companies like eBay and AWS are inherently green because they are marketing their spare capacity. He said, for example, that Amazon\u2019s web service came about because the company was sitting on huge unused capacity, and therefore unnecessary energy costs on unused service.\n\n\n\u201cAWS was invented, to some extent, because they needed so much capacity at peak moments that they were not using 80% of their service at other times,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, renting some of that spare capacity out to people that didn\u2019t have the same peaks that they did made a lot of sense. And that is actually a sustainability business model \u2014 it\u2019s like a service economy rental that takes some amount of physical resources and passes it around. So, if I were counting Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint, I\u2019d put a big tick in the margin for that on the positive side. It\u2019s a commercial and sustainable win-win.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n![](https://www.techrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/trnls-nextbigthing-270x170.jpeg) \n\n\n### Subscribe to the Innovation Insider Newsletter\n\n\nCatch up on the latest tech innovations that are changing the world, including IoT, 5G, the latest about phones, security, smart cities, AI, robotics, and more.\n\n\nDelivered Tuesdays and Fridays\n\n\n[Sign up today](https://www.techrepublic.com/sign-up/) \n\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Dire climate news on the potential of the world to breach a 1.5c temperature increase threshold by 2027 is increasing the pressure to slash carbon emissions.

The second site, the South Texas DAC Hub, is slated for Kleberg County.\n\nThe $1.2 billion in federal funding for the projects represents the largest investment in engineered carbon removal to date, with each hub expected to remove more than 250 times more carbon dioxide than the largest facility currently in operation, according to the Department of Energy.\n\nIn total, both projects are expected to remove 2 million metric tons of CO2, equivalent to the annual emissions of roughly 450,000 gasoline vehicles. The DOE cites estimates that the Biden administration's plan to reach net-zero emissions will require between 400 million and 1.8 billion metric tons of CO2 removed from the atmosphere annually by 2050.\n\n\"Cutting back on our carbon emissions alone won't reverse the growing impacts of climate change; we also need to remove the CO2 that we've already put in the atmosphere\u2014which nearly every climate model makes clear is essential to achieving a net-zero global economy by 2050,\" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards contends the state's \"talented energy workforce and embrace of lower carbon technologies make us the perfect fit for innovative projects like this Direct Air Capture Hub.\"\n\n\"Louisiana's climate action plan has positioned us as a leader in the global energy transition, and this major announcement will create thousands of good-paying jobs while lowering the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement comes as 39 Republican senators including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy have signed on to a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan to spell out their objections to Clean Power Plan 2.0 proposed in May to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants for the first time.\n\nThe letter says the plan violates the Clean Air Act by imposing carbon capture technologies that have not been \"adequately demonstrated,\" and would require fuel switching in conflict with the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA.\n\nThat ruling struck down the initial Clean Power Plan, pushed by the Obama administration in 2015, to set limits on carbon from power plants, finding the EPA lacked authority to implement the plan without congressional approval.\n\nThe proposed Clean Power Plan 2.0 would require coal and natural gas plants to \"co-fire\" with 30% clean hydrogen in 2032 and ramp up to 96% by 2038, and to operate carbon capture technology with a 90% carbon dioxide capture rate by 2030.\n\n\"This proposed rule will drastically increase costs and reduce electricity supplies,\" senators wrote. \"These effects will not only be borne by the regulated community, but by every American, manufacturer, and small business that relies on the electricity grid.\"\n\nThe plan, coupled with the EPA's Electric Generating Unit Strategy, is \"a way to shutter fossil-fuel power plants and bolster President Biden's climate goals,\" senators wrote.\n\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "The U.S. Department of Energy will spend $1.2 billion to create Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs in Louisiana and Texas, creating 2,300 jobs.

As he pointed out, we need to reach net zero carbon emissions much faster than the present plan, as well as sequester the carbon dioxide already in our atmosphere.\n\nThe facts demonstrate that on the topic of transitioning our energy sources to zero emissions, we need to be open to all energy sources including nuclear energy. To help all those energy sources compete, we need a market-driven legislation, such as carbon fee or tax and dividend. The carbon fee or tax gives the market signal that we need to get to energy sources with zero emissions as quickly as possible.\n\nThis is most effectively done at the federal level, but we can do something similar with the Climate Crisis and Environmental Justice Act introduced previously to the Maryland General Assembly. Presently, the plan is to have a prescriptive \u201ccap and invest\u201d plan, the basis of which is the statement that it is alright to cap carbon emissions to a certain level and that government knows where the investments should be.\n\nIn place of \u201ccap and invest,\u201d we need to place in market signals that allow multiple energy sources (and conservation) and communities to all work toward net-zero energy transition as part of a more ambitious Maryland Climate Pathway Plan.\n\n\u2014 Sabrina S.

Thanks to the partnership, we've been able to invest in solar and desalination technology which has both lowered our emissions and allowed us to supply delicious tomatoes to Coles customers all year round,\" said Steve.\n\nMeat and Livestock Australia Managing Director Jason Strong congratulated Coles on working with its suppliers to take positive action on climate, as the Australian red meat and livestock sector works towards achieving its target of being carbon neutral by 2030.\n\n\"Initiatives like this from Coles have potential to provide direction and leadership to help achieve our target of carbon neutrality by 2030. We look forward to seeing the progress Coles can make with its supply chain in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nThis new target and resulting emission reductions will help Coles and its suppliers support the delivery of Australia's national Paris Agreement commitment to reduce emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\nTo further support suppliers to drive innovation and sustainability, Coles continues to award grants of up to $500,000 to small and medium sized businesses as part of the Coles Nurture Fund.

(MHI) has delivered and installed a compact CO2 pilot capture system \"CO2MPACT\u2122\" at its cement plant in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n\n\nThrough a partnership between Heidelberg Materials, the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta, the facility is expected to become the first full-scale carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) solution for the cement industry globally. The new facility, which Heidelberg Materials anticipates being operational by late 2026, will capture more than 1 million tonnes of CO2 annually from its Edmonton cement plant and the combined heat and power facility that is integrated with the capture process.\n\n\nAlberta Minister of Environment and Protected Areas, Rebecca Schulz, joined the Heidelberg Materials and MHI teams at the Edmonton cement plant to formally initiate operations of the pilot CO2 capture system. \"Alberta is widely recognized as a leader in developing CCUS technology thanks in large part to industry trailblazers like Heidelberg Materials,\" said Minister Rebecca Schulz. \"Our province has invested billions of dollars to help industry cut emissions and will continue to support practical innovations that create jobs and grow the economy. We look forward to seeing this exciting Alberta success story continue in the years ahead.\"\n\n\nThis project supports Heidelberg Materials' vision of leading the decarbonization of the cement industry. Actively contributing to the development of the new 1.5\u00b0C framework, Heidelberg Materials was the first company in the cement sector to have its targets endorsed by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in 2019.\n\n\n\"Today is substantial milestone in our journey to building the world's first full-scale carbon capture project in the cement industry,\" said Joerg Nixdorf, Vice President Cement Operations, Northwest Region for Heidelberg Materials North America. \"This initiative focuses the cement industry's decarbonization efforts on the Province of Alberta, and we are encouraged by this significant step to lead the sector in CCUS.\"\n\n\nThe Edmonton cement plant will leverage MHI's proprietary Advanced KM CDR Process\u2122 using the KS-21\u2122 solvent (jointly developed with The Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc.) and will initially pilot the technology by testing different fuel sources and various plant operating modes. The pilot plant will enable Heidelberg Materials to validate the effectiveness of MHI's technology on its specific flue gas as part of a two-stage competitive process that is currently underway to inform the final design. At full operation, captured CO2 will be transported via pipeline and permanently sequestered. MHI's involvement also includes providing remote support services for the facility, using its proprietary remote monitoring system. \"MHI Group is proud to collaborate with Heidelberg Materials as an innovative solution provider for decarbonization of the cement sector, which is still a new frontier for CCUS and excited to contribute to the effort on carbon neutrality in the Province of Alberta.\" said Kenji Terasawa, CEO and Head of Engineering Solutions.\n\n\n\n\n![With Alberta Environment Minister in front of MHI's newly installed carbon capture system at Heidelberg Materials' cement plant in Canada, Aug. 15, 2023 \n(photo courtesy of Heidelberg Materials.)](/jp/media/406351/download \"With Alberta Environment Minister in front of MHI's newly installed carbon capture system at Heidelberg Materials' cement plant in Canada, Aug. 15, 2023 \n(photo courtesy of Heidelberg Materials.)\")With Alberta Environment Minister in front of MHI's newly installed carbon capture system at Heidelberg Materials' cement plant in Canada, Aug. 15, 2023 (photo courtesy of Heidelberg Materials.)\n\n\n\n**About MHI Group's CO2 Capture Technologies**  \n\nMHI has been developing the KM CDR Process \u2122 (Kansai Mitsubishi Carbon Dioxide Recovery Process) and Advanced KM CDR Process \u2122 in collaboration with Kansai Electric Power since 1990. As of August 2023, the Company has delivered 15 plants adopting the KM CDR Process \u2122, and three more are currently under construction. The Advanced KM CDR Process \u2122 uses KS-21 \u2122, which incorporates technological improvements over the amine-based KS-1 \u2122 solvent adopted at all 15 of the commercial CO2 capture plants MHI has delivered to date. The advanced version offers superior regeneration efficiency and lower deterioration than the KS-1 \u2122, and it has been verified to provide excellent energy saving performance, reduce operating costs, and result in low amine emissions.\n\n\nFor further information on MHI's CO2 capture plants:\n\n\n* [https://www.mhi.com/products/engineering/co2plants.html](/products/engineering/co2plants.html\n)\n\n**About Heidelberg Materials**  \n\nBased in Irving, Texas, Heidelberg Materials North America is part of Heidelberg Materials, one of the world's largest integrated manufacturers of building materials and solutions.

It includes new decarbonisation targets, in review by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an assessment method Z\u00fchlke is introducing to measure and improve the impact of its projects, and examples of client collaborations that are driving positive outcomes for people, planet, and profit. \n\n\nInformed by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, Z\u00fchlke\u2019s sustainability strategy centres on climate action and health improvement, with a threefold focus on positive project impact, community engagement, and sustainable ways of working. The report explores the company\u2019s 2022 performance in these key areas, emphasising how technology and collaboration were key to its progress. \n\n\nPositive project impact   \nThe report explores how innovation and technology can create positive impact, outlining some of Z\u00fchlke\u2019s client collaborations in 2022, such as: enabling a railway operator to take concrete steps in its green IT journey, co-developing a data platform that advances medical research while protecting patient privacy, and co-innovating a new sensor that detects methane leaks. \n\n\nTo further improve the impact of client collaborations, Z\u00fchlke has developed and piloted a Project Impact Assessment (PIA) method, providing clear targets and a strong measurement framework to put its aspirations into action. \n\n\nCommunity engagement   \nZ\u00fchlke\u2019s community and social impact activities included donations and sponsorship, pro bono work, and volunteering. Key partners in 2022 included non-profit Aiducation (improving access to education in Kenya and the Philippines), Boozt your Business (empowering startups through mentorship), and Swiss Triple Impact (a sustainability initiative). The company also expanded its \u2018Sustainability Circle\u2019 network, bringing together 150+ business stakeholders in 40+ companies to advance sustainability across diverse sectors within the field of manufacturing. \n\n\nSustainable ways of working   \nWith a commitment to net zero, the business has adopted science-based targets \u2013 currently in review by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Z\u00fchlke aims to achieve net zero Scope 1+2 emissions by 2030, and to become net zero across the entire value chain by 2040. This requires a wide range of measures to reduce emissions by 90% against the company\u2019s 2021 baseline. \n\n\nCompared with its targets, Z\u00fchlke\u2019s overall results for 2022 were disappointing, with a total emissions rise of 41% to 8,489 t CO2e. This was the result of three main drivers: team growth of 20%, an increase in post-pandemic travel and office use, and long lead times for several reduction activities. Despite these challenges, the business was able to lower operational emissions (Scope 1+2) by 5% compared to 2021. It also reduced Scope 2 against overall growth, mainly through switches to renewable electricity. \n\n\nAs part of its focus on sustainable ways of working, Z\u00fchlke also announced steps to ensure \u2018equal pay for equal work\u2019 and committed to publishing dedicated reporting on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). \n\n\nIn the report\u2019s opening letter, Z\u00fchlke Chairman Philipp Sutter stressed the importance of collective business action to advance sustainability: \u2018The long-term success of our clients, and Z\u00fchlke in turn, is deeply connected with the world around us. To thrive in the future, we will need business models, innovation systems, and solutions that positively impact people, planet, and profit. By teaming up with diverse partners with complementary data, capabilities, and a shared goal, we have the means to co-create better solutions \u2013 efficiently, effectively, and at scale\u2019. \n\n\n\"At Z\u00fchlke, we\u2019re convinced that borderless innovation and technology can be a positive force of change for business and society. We take our organisational responsibility here very seriously. Our first Corporate Responsibility Report showed how we made sustainability a strategic goal and consolidated a group-wide approach to decarbonisation. In this report, we explore our 2022 milestones and onward journey.\"  \nFabrizio Ferrandina,  \nGroup CEO, Z\u00fchlke\n\nZ\u00fchlke Group  \n\n[asia@zuhlke.com](mailto:asia@zuhlke.com)  \n\n Lorraine Lai  \n\n Visit us on social media:  \n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zuehlke.group/)  \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zuehlke_group)  \n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zuehlkegroup)  \n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zuehlkegroup/)  \n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/zuhlkegroup)\n\n\n![](https://www.einnews.com/tracking/article.gif?aid=650030232&section=einpresswire&a=qPPXJOhtM2I-u2BI&i=E018UZw7P5TEJgK1)\n\nYou just read:\n\n\nCo-innovating a sustainable future: Z\u00fchlke publishes 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report\n=========================================================================================\n\n\n\n\nNews Provided By\n\n[Zuhlke](https://www.einpresswire.com/sources/u456491?promo=4700)\n\n\n August 15, 2023, 23:15 GMT\n \n\n\nShare This Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Distribution channels:\n [Banking, Finance & Investment Industry](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/banking-finance-investment?promo=4700), [Business & Economy](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/business-economy?promo=4700), [IT Industry](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/it?promo=4700), [Technology](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/technology?promo=4700), [World & Regional](https://www.einpresswire.com/channel/world-regional?promo=4700)\n\n\n  \n\n EIN Presswire's priority is source transparency.

In the eastern province of Zhejiang, villagers in Qingshan have seen their lives transformed after their efforts to protect the Qiantang river allowed biodiversity to flourish. Yang Shanshan tells us more.\u00a0\n\nRen Haibao is a dedicated biologist, and he's spent nearly two decades working in the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest of Kaihua, where the Qiantang River originates. He says the forest is a Chinese treasure.\n\nREN HAIBAO Scientist, Chinese Academy of Sciences \"Every tree in this area has a unique ID, and we monitor their growth by measuring the growth ring every half year. Most primitive forests at low altitudes have already disappeared, but here at the Qianjiangyuan National Park we still preserve this rare and continuous forest.\"\n\nThe falling leaves and seeds of the forest are regularly collected and sent to the nearby observation and research station.\n\nREN HAIBAO Scientist, Chinese Academy of Sciences \"The seeds help us understand why so many species in the forest coexist harmoniously. Biodiversity is the foundation of human existence and sustainable development. It is essential for food, materials, water and soil conservation, carbon storage and even medicine. If we want to live harmoniously with nature, we must preserve biodiversity.\"\n\nThe source of Qiantang River is known as the seed bank of East China. A national park was established to protect thousands of rare plants and wild animals. This not only facilitates scientific research but also safeguards the ecosystem of the whole Qiantang River, which flows through China's most populated and industrialized regions.\u00a0\n\nYANG SHANSHAN Kaihua, Zhejiang Province \"To protect the origin of the Qiantang River, a monitoring center was set up here. They utilize satellites, drones, remote sensors, and other technologies to track climate changes, prevent disasters, and preserve biodiversity.\"\n\nYU SHUNHAI Staff, Qianjiangyuan National Park \"Our remote cameras capture thousands of pictures of rare and wild animals every day. This is crucial for research and the protection of animals. We also provide residents with subsidies to discourage human intervention and protect the environment. And we have established a community to educate people about the importance of ecological protection.\"\n\nEvery year, lots of children visit the national park to study the plants and animals. But more importantly, they experience and learn about the significance of the biodiversity and how the harmonious co-existence of humans and nature is an important resource passed down through the generations.

It embodies the steadfast determination to promote the construction of a Beautiful China and also demonstrates China's firm stance in actively participating in global environmental and climate governance, as well as its commitment to fostering a shared future for humanity.\n\n\n**Vigorous efforts**\n\n\nAccording to a bluebook on China's ecological conservation red lines released by the Ministry of Natural Resources on Tuesday, the red line of ecological conservation is approximately 3.19 million square kilometers, covering all 35 priority areas for biodiversity conservation in China and over 90 percent of typical ecological system types.\n\n\nThe ecological conservation red line refers to areas within an ecological space that have particularly important ecological functions and must be strictly protected on a mandatory basis, including water conservation, biodiversity maintenance, soil and water conservation, windbreak and sand fixation, and coastal ecological stability, as well as environmentally sensitive and fragile areas prone to soil erosion, land desertification, rock desertification and salinization.\n\n\nChina is a mega-diverse country in terms of biodiversity. The protection of biodiversity has been elevated to a national strategy and has become a consensus and action for the entire society, Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, told the Global Times on Tuesday.\n\n\n\"Over the past years, China has actively promoted biodiversity conservation, taking a series of robust measures, including the innovative establishment of the ecological conservation red line system,\" Ma said.\n\n\n\"Based on what we have observed, the demarcation of the ecological red line has been essentially completed across the entire country,\" he added.\n\n\nBesides drawing the red lines, Chinese authorities make full use of resources such as satellites, manned and unmanned aircraft, fixed ground and mobile patrol monitoring to construct an integrated ecological quality monitoring network from \"sky to ground,\" according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.\n\n\nThose monitoring measures focus on natural reserves, ecological conservation red lines and key ecological function areas, Huang Runqiu, head of the ministry, told a press conference on July 27.\n\n\nMore than over 5,000 key issues were identified in national nature reserves, and 79 ecological damage issues were found in five pilot provinces with ecological conservation red lines up to July 27.\n\n\nCurrently, China has over 30 laws on ecological and environmental protection, more than 100 administrative regulations, and over 1,000 local regulations, the National People's Congress said in a post on Tuesday. They lay a solid foundation for establishing and improving the system of ecological civilization.\n\n\nChinese authorities released a guideline on Tuesday to enhance the integration of law enforcement and administering justice in forestry and grassland affairs.\n\n\nJointly issued by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, the guideline is centered on building a coordination mechanism for administrative law enforcement and prosecutorial public interest litigation in forestry and grassland affairs.\n\n\nIn the past decade, the national forest coverage rate increased from 21.63 percent to 24.02 percent, according to a statement sent by the National Forestry and Grassland Administration to the Global Times on Tuesday.\n\n\nChina has contributed one quarter, the most in the world, to the increase in global green coverage. Grasslands have an overall vegetation coverage of 50.32 percent and their status has transformed from production to ecological purposes, the authority said.\n\n\n**Core concept**\n\n\nAs the birthplace and first demonstration site of the concept that \"lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,\" residents in East China's Zhejiang Province, especially Huzhou, have a more vivid experience of the concept.\n\n\nHuzhou's Yucun village, previously the largest limestone mining area in Anji county, is an example as it transformed the local economy from mining to greener industries.\n\n\nThe air in the village used to be shrouded with coal dust and the green bamboo leaves on the mountains were covered in soot. Miners who came out of the mines looked all the same - all covered in black.\n\n\nThe change started in 2002 when Yucun village began shutting down the mines. The momentum of green development became stronger after Xi, then Party Chief of Zhejiang, raised the \"two mountains\" concept on August 15, 2005 during his inspection trip to the county.\n\n\nNowadays, former miners are able to wake up breathing fresh air every day and have sought out ways to make a living in industries related to eco-tourism, such as running guest houses and shops, as well as high-tech agriculture.\n\n\nThe \"lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets\" concept for local people is that they are able to enjoy beautiful and green ecology and at the same time live an abundant life, Chen Guangju, the deputy head of the \"Two Mountains\" Concept Research Institute affiliated with Huzhou University, told the Global Times.\n\n\nWhat other places can learn from the Zhejiang experience is that the practice should first prioritize ecology and seek a development path that fits local conditions so as to reach the goal of common prosperity, Chen said.\n\n\nThe \"two mountains\" concept is and will lead to a new form of human civilization, Chen said.\n\n\nChina's ecological governance approach not only addresses domestic environmental issues but also has a positive impact on global sustainable development and climate management, Sun Shao, a senior researcher at Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.\n\n\nChina's practices in ecological restoration and sustainable development can offer insights and lessons for other countries, propelling worldwide environmental conservation efforts, Sun said.\n\n\n\"Through collaborative initiatives, technology sharing and international cooperation, China plays a vital role in global environmental management, contributing to addressing global challenges such as climate change,\" he added.\n\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN86679&sd=2023-08-16 \"Cision\") View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-times-xis-moment-national-ecology-day-debuts-to-raise-awareness-commitments-301903163.html>\n\n\nSOURCE Global Times\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "China celebrates its first National Ecology Day, with President Xi Jinping urging the whole society to promote the concept that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets for the sustainable development of the Chinese nation.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The article highlights the importance of ecological conservation and the efforts made by China, including setting ambitious goals for carbon neutrality, establishing ecological conservation red lines, and implementing monitoring measures for ecological quality.

The results of the study are described in the journal *Conservation Biology*.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegraded forests include selectively logged areas and others damaged by human activities, but which still retain important natural features. Previous studies have primarily focused on reforestation of clearcut areas, or those converted to agricultural use\u2014including pastures\u2014and subsequently abandoned.\n\n\nHowever, this overlooks the substantial gains to be made by enabling degraded forests to recover. These degraded areas are often found next to intact forest, and their [restoration](https://phys.org/tags/restoration/) could help further protect and enhance these remaining [natural areas](https://phys.org/tags/natural+areas/).\n\n\nRestoring degraded forests represents a strategic and cost-effective option for meeting national and global [climate](https://phys.org/tags/climate/) and biodiversity goals. Degraded forests retain many similarities to natural forests in terms of structure and types of plant species and ecosystems, hence they are more likely to recover rapidly, regain biodiversity levels and store more carbon than cleared land where complete forest restoration will take more time and is less likely to succeed.\n\n\nRestoring degraded forest is also often more cost-effective than reforestation as it may not require the same level of investment in [tree planting](https://phys.org/tags/tree+planting/) and maintenance.\n\n\nThe study highlights the Five Great Forest landscapes of Mesoamerica\u2014an area encompassing parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia that is critical for wildlife, carbon sequestration, clean water, and food security. The inclusion of degraded forests doubled the area of forest restoration opportunity in those landscapes and increased the climate mitigation potential by almost 70%, when compared with reforestation of cleared land.\n\n\nThe study provides a model for prioritizing [restoration efforts](https://phys.org/tags/restoration+efforts/) based on where they can best deliver rapid improvements in forest integrity , where integrity is a metric that represents the opposite of degradation. This prioritization will help land managers and governments target their restoration interventions to maximize efficiency and impact.\n\n\nTim Rayden, WCS Forest Restoration Lead, and lead author of the paper said, \"Forest restoration is sometimes presented as a tradeoff between food security and nature. This is unfortunate, as there is so much scope to restore biodiversity to our farmed landscapes without compromising on food production. But also, as this study shows, because there are such extensive opportunities for nature restoration in degraded forests that don't displace farming activity.\"\n\n\nDr. Kendall Jones, WCS Conservation Planning Specialist and co-author for the paper said, \"Mapping degraded [forest](https://phys.org/tags/forest/) areas means coming to restoration decisions with better information and a better representation of the opportunities\u2014especially those that would bring rapid biodiversity gains, strengthened climate resilience, and valuable benefits for local communities.\"\n\n\nJohn Lotspeich, Executive Director of Trillion Trees commented: \"This study provides us with hope and optimism in what can seem a bleak outlook in the climate crisis. With careful, scientific application we can identify [forest areas](https://phys.org/tags/forest+areas/) that are more cost-effective to restore, and where restoration can rapidly make a significant impact for people, biodiversity and the climate.\"\n\n\nFurther research is needed to more fully quantify the costs and benefits of restoring degraded forests, including those areas that are currently managed for selective logging. This analysis is the first step in recognizing the untapped potential of these areas for climate and [biodiversity](https://phys.org/tags/biodiversity/) solutions.\n \n \n\n\n**More information:**\n Tim Rayden et al, *Conservation Biology* (2023) [DOI: 10.1111/cobi.14163](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14163)\n\n\n\n\n**Journal information:**\n[Conservation Biology](https://phys.org/journals/conservation-biology/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Provided by\n [Wildlife Conservation Society](https://phys.org/partners/wildlife-conservation-society/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Citation**:\n Restoring degraded forests: An under-appreciated climate solution (2023, August 15)\n retrieved 17 August 2023\n from https://phys.org/news/2023-08-degraded-forests-under-appreciated-climate-solution.html\n \n\n This document is subject to copyright.

Carbon Sync is leading a soil carbon sequestration pilot project involving up to 80,000 hectares of the region\u2019s cropping and grazing region. The project is Chevron\u2019s first nature-based carbon offset project in the country, the company said in a news release Friday.\n\n\n\u201cI am thrilled that a large multinational organization has recognized the potential of Carbon Sync to change the carbon equation for WA\u2019s agricultural industry, as well as create jobs and further investment for our state\u201d, Carbon Sync Founder and CEO Louise Edmonds said. \u201cThrough these pilot projects, we aim to enhance the sustainability of WA\u2019s agricultural sector and improve biodiversity outcomes\".\n\n\nChevron has also joined a multiyear research project with Deakin University\u2019s Blue Carbon Lab to explore potential carbon dioxide sequestration opportunities in the region\u2019s coastal wetlands. The Blue Carbon Lab offers \u201cinnovative research solutions aiding to help mitigate climate change and enhance our blue economy, while simultaneously supporting aquatic biodiversity, economic growth, capacity building, and community wellbeing\u201d, according to the news release.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been great mystery into the size of WA\u2019s blue carbon assets and the potential for new blue carbon opportunities through the conservation and restoration of coastal wetlands. This research project seeks to address this knowledge gap\u201d, Blue Carbon Lab Director and Professor Peter Macreadie said.\n\n\n\u201cThe two projects we are part of in WA are examples of the multiple pathways on that lower carbon journey\u201d, Chevron Australia General Manager for Energy Transition David Fallon said. \u201cOur collaboration with Carbon Sync is expected to provide critical insights related to soil carbon projects, in a region with large potential for scale to help meet the forecasted demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units\".\n\n\n\u201cWith the Blue Carbon Lab contribution, we are excited to explore the opportunities for blue carbon in WA\u2019s saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass environments\u201d, Fallon added.\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that the future of energy is lower carbon\u201d, Chevron New Energies Vice President of Offsets and Emerging Barbara Harrison said. \u201cAustralia is not only an essential part of Chevron\u2019s established portfolio, but we also see tremendous potential to develop businesses that help achieve our lower carbon aspirations\".\n\n\n#### Thevenard Island Decommissioning Completed\n\n\nIn an earlier news release, Chevron Australia said it has completed onshore decommissioning work at Thevenard Island, \u201cmarking a significant milestone for Western Australia\u2019s emerging decommissioning industry\u201d.\n\n\nThe Chevron-operated Thevenard Island Joint Venture oil and gas facility, located around 13.7 miles (22 kilometers) from Onslow, produced approximately 150 million barrels of oil over its 25-year lifespan until 2014. The area will be returned to the WA Government once it is restored to a condition similar to and compatible with the adjacent environment, Chevron said.\n\n\nChevron Australia said the decommissioning process involved the plugging of 11 onshore production wells, three water disposal wells, one exploration well and the safe dismantling and removal of three 150,000-barrel oil storage tanks in addition to production tanks, separator vessels, flowlines, associated process infrastructure and ancillary accommodation facilities and utilities including the controlled toppling of the 124.7-foot (38-meter) communications tower. In total, the project resulted in the removal of more than 5,000 metric tons of scrap metal from the island for recycling.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the decommissioning of the Chevron Australia-operated Barrow Island Joint Venture oil facility and associated infrastructure on Barrow Island is expected to start in 2025.\n\n\nChevron Australia\u2019s Director of Operations Danny Woodall said that decommissioning is a growing industry that provides economic opportunities as assets enter the later stages of their lifecycles. \u201cDecommissioning is an enormous economic opportunity that will grow as existing assets enter the later stages of their lifecycles\u201d, Woodall said.\n\n\n\u201cThe Thevenard Island Retirement Project is an example of Chevron\u2019s commitment to progressing decommissioning and rehabilitation activities in a systematic and timely manner to deliver positive outcomes for the environment and local community,\u201d Chevron Australia\u2019s Thevenard Island Retirement Project Manager Chris Jones said.\n\n\nLiberty Industrial\u2019s General Manager Barry Crossey added that the Thevenard Island project \u201cset a new benchmark for transforming end-of-life sites into rehabilitated areas, that can be carried through to future projects in the region and further afield\u201d.\n\n\nChevron Australia engaged several contractors including Liberty Industrial, AGC, Bhagwan Marine, TAMS Group, Golder Associates, and Astron Environmental Services to assist with the decommissioning process, according to the release.\n\n\n**Read the latest issue of the OGV Energy magazine\u00a0[HERE](https://ogv.energy/magazine-item/magazine-78)**\n\n\n\n Published: 15-08-2023\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing Permissions\nOGV Energy will use the information you provide on this form to be in touch with you and to provide updates and marketing.

However, what conditions these \u2018canopy soils\u2019 form in, and what kind of biodiversity they support, has been difficult to study.\n\n\n\n> The fact it\u2019s taken until now to even start to recognise [canopy soils'] importance is amazing \u2013 not least because we may be destroying them faster than we can study them. Dr Bonnie Waring\n\n\nNow, researchers from Utah State University and Imperial College London have surveyed dozens of trees in Costa Rica, mapping the canopy soils to determine where they form and how they might be affected by a changing climate. The results are published in *[Geoderma](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116609)*.\n\n\nFirst author Jessica Murray, from Utah State University, said: \u201cWe found canopy soils most often form in cool, foggy areas in these tropical forests where there are large, old trees. Unfortunately, this describes some of the most at-risk forest types, which are threatened by changing climate and deforestation.\u201d\n\n\nHer PhD supervisor [Dr Bonnie Waring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.waring), now at the Department of Life Sciences (Silwood Park) at Imperial, added: \u201cCanopy soils in tropical cloud forests are rich in life and nutrients and could be large carbon stores. The fact it\u2019s taken until now to even start to recognise their importance is amazing \u2013 not least because we may be destroying them faster than we can study them.\u201d\n\n\nUnique habitat\n--------------\n\n\nTo study the soils, Murray climbed trees in six primary (i.e. untouched) rainforest sites in Costa Rica. These included sites along one of the last continuous lines of primary rainforest in South America, with elevations ranging from 67\u20132700 m above sea level and mean annual temperature ranging from 10\u201324\u00baC, plus variable rainfall and fog abundance.\n\n\n![The legs and feet of a person on a branch looking down into the forest far below](//www.imperial.ac.uk/ImageCropToolT4/imageTool/uploaded-images/pc-marco-molina_1692116890493_x2.jpg?r=4807)\nCredit: Marco Molina\n\nShe scaled trees up to heights of 15-30m to find canopy soils and measure their biodiversity and soil chemistry. This revealed a great diversity in composition, even along a branch and between trees close to each other \u2013 making each soil mat (soil + moss + plants) its \u201cown little forest\u201d.\n\n\nThese forests-in-miniature contain abundant plant and animal life, with invertebrates also supporting varied bird species. The plants include epiphytes \u2013 plants that live on other plants \u2013 which are especially common in cloud forests.\n\n\nCanopy soils are nutrient-rich, thanks to mosses that convert nitrogen from the air, meaning the epiphytes that live there are healthier than other types that live directly on tree bark (commonly known as air plants). There is even evidence that the trees themselves take advantage of the soils, growing roots into them to obtain some of the nutrients.\n\n\nUnder threat\n------------\n\n\nThe results show canopy soils in general were most abundant in higher, cooler areas with plenty of fog and larger, older trees. While it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how long they take to form, the team estimate some soil mats could take more than a hundred years to reach full maturity.\n\n\n\n> If these soils are crucial for the forest to be an optimum carbon sink, then their formation should be a final marker of a truly recovered forest. Jessica Murray\n\n\nUnfortunately, this means they could be difficult to replace if they are lost. As the climate heats up, the fog cloud levels are rising in these forests, meaning many soils could disappear and there may not be trees high enough to replace them.\n\n\nMany such forests have also been logged or face future deforestation, and even where forests have been allowed to recover (secondary forests), few if any would have had sufficient time to regrow mature canopy soils.\n\n\nMurray said: \u201cDetermining the contribution of canopy soils to forest carbon budgets is important for assessing their role in mitigating climate change. It could also be an important marker for recovery: if these soils are crucial for the forest to be an optimum carbon sink, then their formation should be a final marker of a truly recovered forest.\u201d\n\n\nThe rich habitat of canopy soils also means they hold a lot of carbon, and could be an important missing factor in carbon balance models \u2013 whether a forest as a whole is releasing or drawing down carbon. To determine the contribution, Murray says the next steps in the research will be to find a way to determine how much canopy soil there is within a landscape, for example via remote sensing.\n\n\nDr Waring concluded: \u201cThis research shows the value of intact forest ecosystems: restoration of logged forests is important, but some features can\u2019t be put back. We need some policies that focus on preserving landscapes that are ecologically diverse and carbon rich.\u201d\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u2018[Climate, as well as branch-level processes, drive canopy soil abundance and chemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706123002860)\u2019 by Jessica\u00a0Murray,\u00a0A.

The review by scientists from France explained that almost all C3 plants \u2013 which employ the C3 pathway for photosynthesis where the first carbon compound has three carbon atoms \u2013 that are exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide show reduction across nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, zinc, magnesium and sulphur.\n\n\n[Estimates reveal](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide) that compared to the pre-industrial era, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are now 50 percent higher. In 2022, global average carbon dioxide levels rose to 417.06 parts per million, resulting in a new record increase.\n\n\nIn May this year, carbon dioxide levels measured by NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory averaged 424.0 parts per million (ppm), an increase of 3.0 ppm over May 2022.\n\n\nWhile being a vital resource for plants, carbon dioxide is also among the prominent greenhouse gases. Considering that the majority of plants on the planet, including cereals like wheat, rice, barley and oats, use the C3 pathway, the review article raised alarm bells about increasing carbon dioxide levels not only impact the quantity of food produced but also its quality.\n\n\nAlthough this phenomenon was recorded about two decades ago, recent evidence has aided in establishing the extent of its impact, states the review article.\n\n\n![The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (blue line) has increased along with human emissions (gray line) since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750.

According to the [Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022](https://www.globalhungerindex.org/pdf/en/2022/India.pdf), India ranked 107 out of 121 countries and has a hunger issue that has been designated as serious. GHI 2022 also stated that India has the highest child wasting rate (children who are too thin for their height) in the world. In 2022, a report published in the BMJ Global Health highlighted that severe acute malnutrition has drastically [increased\u00a0in India](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9024259/) over the last two decades.\n\n\nIn light of these findings, the fact that crops are becoming inherently less nutritious is worrisome, said Dr. Hemapriya Natesan, Founder & CEO [My Little Moppet](https://shop.mylittlemoppet.com/about-little-moppet-foods/), an e-commerce platform for children\u2019s food products.\n\n\nDr. Natesan explained that early food choices are vital in establishing healthy eating patterns in the future, and optimal nutrition at the right time makes all the difference. While this may seem like a well-established fact, as a mother and a doctor, Dr. Natesan has both seen the impacts of inadequate nutrition and faced challenges in providing optimal nutrition in a landscape where sugar-laden cereals are the norm.\n\n\n![A study shows that plants growing in elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide conditions are showing a decline in mineral, protein and vitamin content.

Ravikanth](https://www.atree.org/users/dr-g-ravikanth), Associate Professor in the Suri Sehgal Centre For Biodiversity And Conservation, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore.\n\n\n\u201cWhen plants are exposed to more carbon dioxide, there is increased photosynthesis, which in turn leads to more biomass. To meet the new demand, plants try to draw more nutrients from the soil. Additionally, the carbon dioxide also affects the soil\u2019s microflora, thereby impacting the decomposition rates in the soil and influencing the nutrients available to plants,\u201d he said. The vicious cycle makes it difficult to grow crops without the addition of external nutrients, he remarked.\n\n\nJust like India\u2019s troubled nutritional landscape, the Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas published in 2016 revealed that [India\u2019s soil organisms are at high risk](https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/publications/1187/files/original/LPR2018_Full_Report_Spreads.pdf) due to various threats such as pollution, intensive agriculture, erosion and climate change, among others.\n\n\nA separate research study [published in 2018](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaq1012) revealed that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide impacts not only micronutrients but also the protein and vitamin content of rice grains. The study found that apart from protein, zinc and iron, carbon dioxide levels also lead to a decline in B1, B2, B5 and B9 vitamins. While the exact health outcomes are difficult to measure, considering the fact that rice is the [primary food source](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/wbt-staple-food-crops-world/) for more than half of the world\u2019s population, these deficiencies can pose significant health risks.\n\n\n[Lewis H. Ziska](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/lewis-ziska), Associate Professor in the Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, who is one of the co-authors of the study, writes in a related [blog post](https://cupblog.org/2023/04/06/the-truth-about-rising-co2-and-its-effect-on-plant-biology-lewis-h-ziska/) that these silent changes to plant physiology are often not part of mainstream narratives about the effects of rising carbon dioxide as they are hard to envisage. In an email interview, Ziska reiterated the importance of understanding these underlying changes. \u201cThe larger implications of reduced nutritional values are enormous, not only in terms of human health through CO2-induced effects on protein, vitamins and micronutrients, but the role that this will also play in regards to the global food chain,\u201d said Ziska, who has also written a book on the impact of carbon dioxide on plants and life.\n\n\n![Deficiencies in the mineral, protein and vitamin content of crops due to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide can have significant impacts on India\u2019s nutritional and agricultural landscape.

Photo from Unsplash.\n**Diversity in crops can help address nutrition**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTalking about a possible solution to the issue, Ravikanth of ATREE admitted that it is a complex problem to solve, but one way to prepare for a nutritionally challenged future is to grow plants that better assimilate nutrients from the soil and provide optimal yields. Trials are ongoing at various research centres such as the University of Agricultural Sciences, GKVK, Bengaluru.\n\n\nZiska added that at the policy-level, crop lines that have higher nutrient content must also be incentivised to encourage their cultivation.\n\n\n\u201cThe earth provides a wide array of genetics among plants that we consume. Encouraging diversity in both time (crop rotation) and space (planting different crop lines in the same location) are absolutely essential in addressing the nutrition issue,\u201d said Ziska.\n\n\nNatesan further added that the approach is paramount not only on the field but also on the plate. \u201cClimate change mitigation requires all stakeholders to work together and come up with long term solutions. But what we can do right now is focus on consuming more traditional grains and ensuring a healthier diet, free of chemical inputs, so we address these deficiencies early on to the best of our abilities,\u201d she said.\n\n\n**CITATION:**\n\n\nGojon A, Cassan O, Bach L, Lejay L, Martin A.

These credits allow businesses to enhance their sustainability efforts and contribute to environmental projects. However, the market has faced challenges, with both prices and volumes declining.\n\nOne of the flaws in the market is that carbon credits are traded as commodities, which has led to a lack of trust and the proliferation of poor quality credits. Unlike other commodities where physical delivery takes place, carbon credits representing emissions reductions or removals are not physically settled. Buyers must rely on the honesty and monitoring of the supplier, creating a potential for fraudulent activity.\n\nAnother problem is that all carbon credits are treated as equal and interchangeable, despite significant variations in quality. Factors such as the type of project and its management can impact the quality of carbon offsets. Risks include accurate accounting of emissions reductions, additionality (whether emissions would have been avoided or removed without the credit), permanence of emissions storage, and sustainable development considerations.\n\nThe lack of regulation in the market has allowed for a lack of scrutiny. To address this, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market has introduced its Core Carbon Principles benchmark, defining high-quality credits. However, this binary interpretation of carbon credits is insufficient in capturing the differences and risk factors between projects.\n\nCalls for a standardized global rating system for carbon credits have grown louder. Such a system would assign grades to projects based on their likelihood of success in reducing emissions. Higher-rated credits would then be more valuable, providing incentives for high-quality projects. Increased transparency and standardized disclosure throughout a project\u2019s life cycle are also necessary to allow for better evaluation and rating.\n\nWhile ratings can help, there needs to be a mechanism to link a project\u2019s rating with its actual carbon reduction performance. This could involve adjusting the value of credits based on their performance. The goal is to establish higher standards and ensure that carbon credits genuinely contribute to emissions reductions.\n\nIn conclusion, the market for voluntary carbon credits is facing challenges due to the trading of credits as commodities and a lack of quality stratification. Higher standards, increased transparency, and a standardized global rating system are needed to build trust and ensure effective emissions reductions.\n\n\n [AI](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/ai/), [Business](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/business/), [News](https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/news2/)", "summaries": [{"summary": "The market for voluntary carbon credits has seen significant growth but is facing challenges due to flaws such as lack of trust and poor quality credits.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The market is facing challenges and has flaws."}, {"summary": "Carbon credits are treated as equal and interchangeable despite variations in quality based on factors like project type and management.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The lack of quality stratification is a flaw."}, {"summary": "Calls for a standardized global rating system and increased transparency have grown for carbon credits.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The calls for a global rating system and increased transparency are neutral positions."}, {"summary": "Establishing higher standards and linking project ratings with actual carbon reduction performance are necessary for effective emissions reductions.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Higher standards and linking ratings to performance are positive steps towards effective emissions reductions."}], "semantic_commentary": "Important to establish standardized global rating system for carbon credits.", "sentiment_score": -0.25, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions carbon credits and the need for standardized global rating system and increased transparency."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon and the challenges facing the market for voluntary carbon credits."}]}, {"source": "Traders Magazine", "link": "https://www.tradersmagazine.com/tech-tuesday/tech-tuesday-trends-in-carbon-markets/", "title": "TECH TUESDAY: Trends in Carbon Markets\u00a0 - Traders Magazine", "content": "\n[Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradersmagazine.com%2Ftech-tuesday%2Ftech-tuesday-trends-in-carbon-markets%2F)[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=TECH+TUESDAY%3A+Trends+in+Carbon+Markets%C2%A0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradersmagazine.com%2Ftech-tuesday%2Ftech-tuesday-trends-in-carbon-markets%2F)[Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradersmagazine.com%2Ftech-tuesday%2Ftech-tuesday-trends-in-carbon-markets%2F)\n**[TECH TUESDAY](https://www.tradersmagazine.com/category/tech-tuesday/)\u00a0is a weekly content series covering all aspects of capital markets technology. TECH TUESDAY is produced in collaboration with Nasdaq.**\n\n\nSupported by\u00a0[marketplace technology](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/marketplace-services-platform/carbon-credit-exchanges)\u00a0that boosts institutional confidence, carbon markets can continue to develop and grow. Traders Magazine spoke with\u00a0[Gerard Smith](https://www.nasdaq.com/authors/gerard-smith),\u00a0Vice President, Head of Product- Digital Assets & Carbon at Nasdaq\u2019s Marketplace Technology business, about the current landscape and the outlook for future, both globally and in the key region of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\u00a0\n\n\n**What is the current state of play for carbon trading and markets globally?**\n\n\n\n![](https://www.tradersmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/14-kopiera.jpg)Gerard Smith, Nasdaq\nOne issue is the fragmentation of markets. Another issue that is hampering these markets is that there\u2019s little to no consistency between jurisdictions on how carbon credits are considered legally \u2013 some jurisdictions consider carbon credits as an expense, some think about it as an asset, some think about it as a commodity. And depending on the legal structure around those assets, that has a knock-on impact with respect to how they\u2019re treated from a tax perspective and an accounting perspective. So that\u2019s one barrier to participation in these markets, especially if you\u2019re thinking about them from a global perspective.\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest issue is a lack of liquidity, due to a lack of supply. The whole concept of carbon markets is to channel capital into projects \u2013 whether it be forestation, solar, or direct air capture of carbon \u2013\u00a0through market mechanisms. The investments channeled into those projects are what create the credits in the first place. Therefore the lack of supply of credits should be addressed as other barriers to market participation are addressed.\n\n\n**Has market infrastructure kept up with the emergence / growth of carbon markets? Where are the gaps?**\n\n\nThe growth of carbon markets has been significant, and it should become more significant as more corporates set net-zero targets and must purchase credits to meet those targets. Right now, a lot of corporates tend to buy the credits and then retire them, so there isn\u2019t a great deal of secondary market activity. This causes a problem with price transparency, which in itself can be a problem for the growth of these markets.\n\n\nAnother gap is a lack of intermediaries in the market. There is some custodian bank and broker activity, but lots of banks come to us and say they have clients who are interested in buying credits, but they would prefer for their banking and custody partners to deal with the sourcing, purchase, custody and retirement process on their behalf, i.e they want someone to take that pain away. So more participation of intermediaries, custodians, and brokers especially, would generate more secondary market activity and more institutionalization of these markets.\n\n\n**How can FMIs (Financial Market Infrastructures) such as Nasdaq support the development of carbon markets?**\n\n\nWe are seeing some FMIs, who typically act as the local exchange in a particular jurisdiction with clearing and settlement facilities, beginning to become interested and step into carbon markets. Sometimes that\u2019s because the local government has asked them to set up a carbon trading facility for that country.\u00a0\n\n\nThe alternative to that is a growth of global marketplaces that tend to be driven by startup companies.\u00a0\n\n\nIt will be easier for FMIs to step into carbon markets when there\u2019s more clarity around legality, regulation, tax, etc. So in the short term, the main goals for FMIs will be to seek more clarity around some of those aspects, before they dive fully into facilitating those markets.\u00a0\n\n\n**As an area susceptible to climate change impacts, why is MENA an ideal staging ground for the growth and maturation of carbon markets?**\n\n\nFor one, the Middle East has seen incredible development of their capital markets, especially over the past 20 years. Looking at UAE or Saudi Arabia for example, they have sophisticated capital markets infrastructure in terms of exchanges, clearing, settlement, and risk management, so they are well-placed to take on a new asset class like carbon.\n\n\nSecond, most countries in the Middle East are big producers of oil and natural gas. Thereare many projects in the Middle East that can capture the carbon emissions from oil and gas production, and actually create carbon credits from avoiding what they would have emitted otherwise.\n\n\nAnd third, the Middle East is a place where you can find vast amounts of capital. Deploying that capital from the Middle East into projects, especially in the global south, is an important route for capital to get into the projects in the first place. So, you see capital from the Middle East finds its way into places like Africa, where you can fund and invest in these projects to create the offsets that they need in the Middle East, or as an alternative to their own carbon capture and storage projects.\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, the channeling of capital to projects in the global south can also assist with sustainable development goals.\n\n\n**What do you see for the future of carbon trading and markets, both in MENA and globally?**\n\n\nWe are likely to see many more corporates making net-zero commitments, which means that demand for carbon credits will grow. That\u2019s good for voluntary carbon markets, because increased prices would make more projects viable in terms of being able to sell the credits they produce. That should bring more supply onstream over time.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also likely to be more regulation, institutionalization and legal clarity. That\u2019s a good thing, because people need to understand how to deal with carbon as an asset class.\n\n\nFinally, there\u2019s something in the Paris Agreement called Article 6.4, which makes it possible for countries to enter into an agreement with each other to trade emissions. So if the UK has a target of reducing emissions by 10, but they\u2019ve only managed to reduce them by 8, they can go and find the other two from another country that they have an agreement with. It\u2019s not yet fully understood how this mechanism for cross-border trading of carbon credits will work in relation to voluntary carbon markets, but as the framework becomes more operational, that should stimulate the market.\u00a0\n\n\n*Creating tomorrow\u2019s markets today.

CFTC and FTC Both Scrutinize Fraud in Carbon Markets | Holland & Knight LLP - JDSupra", "content": "\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have recently and aggressively signaled their intent to ramp up enforcement activity regarding the use of carbon offsets to make environmental claims. These moves should encourage market participants to understand and evaluate the impact of agency actions on any current and planned activities to make environmental marketing claims about use of offsets.\n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n\nCarbon offsets represent carbon emission reductions or removal and are traded in either in the over\u2011the\u2011counter market or on exchanges. There are futures contracts on various types carbon offsets, many of which allow physical delivery of the offsets at settlement. The market is global and has grown to $2 billion as of 2022, with projections valuing the market at upwards of $10 billion by 2030.\n\n\nOffsets are a popular tool that companies use to reduce their net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and live up to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, as well as promises to consumers. By purchasing carbon offsets, businesses are typically financing renewable energy projects that remove GHG emissions from the atmosphere or avoid GHG emissions \u2013 such as commitments to preserve forests or the construction of facilities to capture carbon emissions \u2013 without being involved directly in these projects.\n\n\nDouble Regulation of Carbon Offset Markets and Related Environmental Claims\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFor the first time since 2012, the FTC is evaluating potential updates to its Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims (Green Guides or Guides) to provide clarity to marketers labeling products or making environmental claims, including stricter guidance for marketing claims made in connection with carbon offsets.[1](#_edn1) The proposed update seeks to add more teeth to the guidance by addressing how companies link their use of offsets to claims that products or businesses are carbon-neutral, have net\u2011zero emissions, or are low\u2011carbon or carbon-negative.[2](#_edn2) Because the Guides provide the definitive interpretation of how the FTC will exercise its broad statutory authority over unfair and deceptive practices with respect to environmental claims, failure to follow the Guides may result in an increased risk of enforcement by both the FTC and its counterpart state regulators.\n\n\nThe update to the Green Guides is happening at the same time as several actions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) signifying its increased focus on environmental markets. **Historically viewed as a futures and swaps regulator, the CFTC also has jurisdiction to bring enforcement actions for fraud and manipulation in physical commodity markets. The CFTC has turned that jurisdictional focus to environmental markets.**\n\n\nNew Environmental Fraud Task Force: Watch for Increased Enforcement\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe CFTC recently created an Environmental Fraud Task Force to scrutinize fraud and other misconduct in regulated and voluntary carbon markets. The task force will examine, among other things, fraud with respect to the purported environmental benefits of purchased carbon offsets, as well as registrants' material misrepresentations regarding ESG products or strategies.\n\n\nThe CFTC also issued a whistleblower alert seeking tips related to misconduct in carbon markets. The CFTC's whistleblower program offers a monetary reward, not only to the victim of the fraud, but also to company insiders and any other market participant who voluntarily provides information about violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or CFTC regulations that lead to successful enforcement.\n\n\nThe Environmental Fraud Task Force will use the whistleblower alert as a tool to gather information to bring cases. In particular, the CFTC is interested in:\n\n\n* manipulative and wash trading or other violations of the CEA in carbon market futures contracts\n* fraud in the underlying spot markets related to ghost (illusory) carbon offsets listed on carbon market registries\n* double counting or other fraud related to carbon offsets\n* fraudulent statements relating to material terms of the carbon offset\n* manipulation of tokenized carbon markets\n\n\nThe CEA gives the CFTC the far\u2011reaching authority to pursue enforcement against \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in connection with \"a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce,\" regardless of a business' intent.[3](#_edn3) And the characterizations of double counting and fraud in the whistleblower alert are incredibly broad. Under these descriptions, **the CFTC could potentially bring enforcement actions outside of the trading context**. For example, the CFTC could prosecute a project developer that uses deceptive claims in marketing offsets or a company that markets cargos of \"carbon-neutral\" crude oil. To avoid potential enforcement by both the CFTC and the FTC, businesses will need to be careful in structuring not only their trades in carbon offsets, but also in crafting their project documentation and in making marketing claims related to their use of carbon markets to offset their emissions.\n\n\nDouble Enforcement?\n-------------------\n\n\n**Could both the FTC and the CFTC bring separate enforcement actions against a company for the same underlying fact pattern involving fraud in carbon markets? Right now, without further guidance from either agency, the answer is yes.**[4](#_edn4) Comments to the Green Guides illustrate that businesses are concerned about the possibility of double enforcement and recommend that the FTC consult with the CFTC and other agencies asserting jurisdiction over carbon markets.\n\n\nBelow is a nonexclusive list of interrelated potential problems with carbon offsets that may lead to enforcement actions by the FTC or CFTC or both:\n\n\n* **Fraudulent Claims that Offsets Are \"Additional.\"** \"Additionality\" refers to the guarantee that a business' use of carbon offsets leads to carbon reduction actually occurring in addition to any reductions that would have occurred in a business-as-usual scenario or as required by law. Several commenters in response to the FTC's proposed update of the Green Guides responded in favor of requiring that parties using offsets demonstrate additionality, and the CFTC's whistleblower alert specifies that a fraudulent or deceptive claim about additionality in the material terms of a carbon offset constitutes misconduct that could lead to enforcement. Parties using offsets should take care to understand the actual carbon reduction or removal linked to the offset and ensure that the reduction or removal is \"additional.\"\n* **Double Counting and Ghost Credits.** The CFTC has stated that it is examining fraud in the underlying spot markets related to \"ghost credits\" (illusory offsets), as well as double counting of offsets (when the same offset is claimed by more than one entity without an additional carbon benefit). Ghost credits and double counting exist because there is currently no legal requirement that companies verify the quality of offsets used to make climate claims, although many parties are currently voluntarily verifying through bodies such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM). Comments to the Guides supported the idea that verification of the quality of offsets should be required for their use. Likewise, entities have suggested that the CFTC create a registration framework for offsets, offset registries and offset brokers and conduct greater oversight of the existing registries; however, it is not clear that these actions are within the CFTC's authority. Companies should be careful not to make marketing claims about the use of offsets to create a \"net\u2011zero\" supply chain, for example, before verifying that the offsets exist and are not being double-counted.\n* **Fraudulent Claims Related to Sustainability and ESG.** The CFTC and FTC could both potentially bring an enforcement action based on a company's fraudulent use of offsets to create a \"sustainable\" business in line with its ESG goals. The FTC asked whether it should provide specific guidance on the use of \"sustainability\" or \"sustainable\" claims, given that Guides do not currently define the terms. In response, commenters criticized some companies' current use of offsets to substantiate misleading sustainable or net\u2011zero claims. Similarly, the CFTC's new Environmental Fraud Task force will specifically look for \"material misrepresentations regarding ESG products or strategies.\"[5](#_edn5) It is difficult for companies to know when statements about sustainability and ESG in relation to carbon offset trading, projects or marketing are fraudulent because the terms are not currently defined in the Guides or by the CFTC.\n\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\n\nThe CFTC has limited resources, and the actions discussed above signify that carbon markets are an area of increased focus for the CFTC. As agency enforcement in carbon markets develops alongside the markets themselves, businesses will face increasing challenges when both trading in carbon offsets and making advertising claims based on the use of offsets. We anticipate that actions of the FTC and CFTC, among other agencies, will overlap in the carbon market space. Agency authority over carbon markets has not yet been tested in courts, although it is expected that these challenges are coming.\n\n\nIn the meantime, businesses will need to comply with agency actions concerning carbon markets to avoid adverse enforcement consequences.

From Maui to New York, Portland to Texas, and across the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, America\u2019s electricity grids are buckling under extreme summer heat. Earlier severe weather events, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Superstorm Isaias in 2020, alerted New York\u2019s Long Island to vulnerabilities in its transmission and distribution network. Sandy alone caused more than $19 billion in damage to New York state. On Long Island, high-speed winds, heavy rains and a 14-foot storm surge left a half-million people without power for more than a week and wreaked havoc on Long Island\u2019s grid. The Long Island Power Authority last week issued $400 million in bonds to fund much-needed grid improvements to boost the utility\u2019s resilience to extreme weather events and accommodate more renewable energy. \u201cElectric systems that are operating today and that will be operating for decades should consider, and prepare for, the possible range of future environments,\u201d writes **Rose Fadjia Joseph** of HIP Investor, which gives Long Island Power a rating of 86.9 out of 100, connoting outperformance on health, equality, trust and other pillars.\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Dealflow: Blue Economy\n\n\n\n**Gabon raises a $500 million blue bond to swap debt for nature.** Investing in ocean health represents one of the best opportunities for slowing climate change, protecting billions of livelihoods, and preserving biodiverse ecosystems. Yet Sustainable Development Goal No. 14, \u201clife below water,\u201d is the least funded of the 17 global goals. The US International Development Finance Corp. provided a $500 million political risk guarantee to support marine preservation and restoration in the central African nation of Gabon. The insurance helped Gabon to buy back more than $430 million of its international debt and roll it into a $500 million \u201cblue bond\u201d at a lower rate. The capital, which will be used marine conservation, is expected to unlock an additional $163 million over 15 years. **The Nature Conservancy**, which helped design debt-for-nature swaps, advised the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Signals: Carbon Markets\n\n\n\n**African leaders want a bigger slice of a bigger market for voluntary carbon credits.** Africa needs $250 billion a year to finance climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Yet the continent of 1.2 billion people attracts just $30 billion, or about 2% of global climate funding. One potential source of climate financing: the $2 billion global market for voluntary carbon credits, reports **Lucy Ngige** for ImpactAlpha from Nairobi. Carbon credits have been criticized for greenwashing and poor quality projects, but African leaders see an opportunity to boost oversight and fund sustainable development. Kenya\u2019s President **William Ruto** has called carbon credits Kenya\u2019s \u201cnext significant export.\u201d The Carbon Credit and Benefit Sharing bill, now making its way through Kenya\u2019s parliament, splits carbon proceeds among project owners, local and national governments, and communities.

Yet the vast continent of nearly 1.5 billion people attracts just $30 billion, or about 2% of global climate funding. \n\n *One promising source of climate financing:* the $2 billion global market for voluntary carbon credits. \n\n Carbon credits have been criticized for greenwashing and poor quality projects, but African leaders see an opportunity to boost oversight and fund sustainable development. Kenya\u2019s President **William Ruto** has called carbon credits Kenya\u2019s \u201cnext significant export.\u201d \n\n The Carbon Credit and Benefit Sharing bill, now making its way through Kenya\u2019s parliament, splits carbon proceeds among project owners, local and national\u00a0governments and communities. A project in a community forest, for example, would channel 55% of proceeds to communities, 25% to national governments, and 15% to county governments. Another bill, the Climate Change Amendment, regulates trading and engagement in carbon markets. \n\n Ruto helped launch the [Africa Carbon Markets Initiative](https://www.energyalliance.org/news-insights/acmi-adsw/) at last year\u2019s COP27 in Egypt to help African nations unlock up to $120 billion from carbon markets and create more than 110 million jobs by 2050. The world has \u201ca golden opportunity,\u201d Ruto [said](https://www.energyalliance.org/news-insights/acmi-adsw/), to develop carbon markets that \u201ccan yield attractive income and development opportunities for communities at the frontlines in the fight against climate change.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n ### **Everyone in**\n\n Malawi launched an initiative in June to regulate carbon projects on its land and ensure that the government and local communities benefit. In May, Zimbabwe abruptly declared that it would take a 50% cut of all carbon projects. \n\n One of the largest and earliest forest conservation projects, the Kariba Project in Zimbabwe, was the subject of a July [investigation](https://www.ftm.eu/articles/renowed-carbon-credit-project-lacks-transparancy?share=cHi%2Fzsg0VVHEU%2FC4vV5bIUY%2FqxdsVZCK%2Fe2vpM9ckaHSyufCO%2FHmMhz993lGPbM%3D) by *Follow The Money* that found that communities received very little from the $100 million generated from the sale of credits to buyers like Gucci and Volkswagen.\u00a0\n\n ### **Carbon capture**\n\n Kenya issued more than 20% of all carbon credits in Africa between 2016 and 2021. The nation has the potential to mobilize up to $600 million per year by 2030, based on an average price of $20 per ton, according to the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative. That would require it to generate credits from a broader range of projects.\n\n Nairobi-based direct air capture startup Octavia Carbon is working with New York-based Cella Mineral Storage to remove carbon from the air and store it in mineral rock in Kenya\u2019s Great Rift Valley.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n ###### \nGuest Author\n\n #### Lucy Ngige\n\n  ###### \nImpactAlpha Editor\n\n #### Amy Cortese\n\n   ###### August 16, 2023\n\n ### The Brief\n\n ##### Featured: Muni Impact\n\n **Long Island issues $400 million green bond to finance a climate-resilient electric grid**. From Maui to New York, Portland to Texas, and across the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, America\u2019s electricity grids are buckling under extreme summer heat. Earlier severe weather events, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Superstorm Isaias in 2020, alerted New York\u2019s Long Island to vulnerabilities in its transmission and distribution network. Sandy alone caused more than $19 billion in damage to New York state. On Long Island, high-speed winds, heavy rains and a 14-foot storm surge left a half-million people without power for more than a week and wreaked havoc on Long Island\u2019s grid. The Long Island Power Authority last week issued $400 million in bonds to fund much-needed grid improvements to boost the utility\u2019s resilience to extreme weather events and accommodate more renewable energy. \u201cElectric systems that are operating today and that will be operating for decades should consider, and prepare for, the possible range of future environments,\u201d writes **Rose Fadjia Joseph** of HIP Investor, which gives Long Island Power a rating of 86.9 out of 100, connoting outperformance on health, equality, trust and other pillars.\n\n\n ##### Dealflow: Blue Economy\n\n **Gabon raises a $500 million blue bond to swap debt for nature.** Investing in ocean health represents one of the best opportunities for slowing climate change, protecting billions of livelihoods, and preserving biodiverse ecosystems. Yet Sustainable Development Goal No. 14, \u201clife below water,\u201d is the least funded of the 17 global goals. The US International Development Finance Corp. provided a $500 million political risk guarantee to support marine preservation and restoration in the central African nation of Gabon. The insurance helped Gabon to buy back more than $430 million of its international debt and roll it into a $500 million \u201cblue bond\u201d at a lower rate. The capital, which will be used marine conservation, is expected to unlock an additional $163 million over 15 years. **The Nature Conservancy**, which helped design debt-for-nature swaps, advised the deal.\n\n\n ##### Signals: Carbon Markets\n\n **African leaders want a bigger slice of a bigger market for voluntary carbon credits.** Africa needs $250 billion a year to finance climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Yet the continent of 1.2 billion people attracts just $30 billion, or about 2% of global climate funding. One potential source of climate financing: the $2 billion global market for voluntary carbon credits, reports **Lucy Ngige** for ImpactAlpha from Nairobi. Carbon credits have been criticized for greenwashing and poor quality projects, but African leaders see an opportunity to boost oversight and fund sustainable development. Kenya\u2019s President **William Ruto** has called carbon credits Kenya\u2019s \u201cnext significant export.\u201d The Carbon Credit and Benefit Sharing bill, now making its way through Kenya\u2019s parliament, splits carbon proceeds among project owners, local and national governments, and communities.

Still, nature is woefully underfinanced, with investments in nature-based solutions needing to double to USD 384 billion per year by 2025, according to [UNEP](https://www.unep.org/resources/state-finance-nature-2022).\u00a0\n\nUsing crediting to incorporate natural climate solutions (NCS) into carbon markets is one way to [generate significant finance for nature while cutting emissions](https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/Power_of_markets_to_increase_ambition.pdf), and it\u2019s gaining public and private sector attention. However, both producing and using credits raises important equity considerations. [A new paper](https://www.edf.org/economics-discussion-paper-series) from EDF focuses on the issues around use, including how credits may impact the communities surrounding polluting facilities. This blog lays out the framing, key issues, and potential solutions, with more detailed analysis available in the paper.\u00a0\n\n**To understand equity, ask the right questions**\u202f\u00a0\n\nAchieving environmental [equity](https://www.edf.org/about/equity-and-environmental-justice-edf) means ensuring that both the processes and outcomes associated with policy decisions are fair and just. Environmental benefits and burdens must be balanced. Everyone is entitled to a healthy ecosystem.\u00a0\n\nAcross academic and civil society literature, environmental equity is often framed along three dimensions: recognitional, procedural, and distributional equity. The graphic below defines these dimensions of equity and provides examples of questions that carbon market stakeholders should ask when designing and implementing crediting programs.\u00a0\n\n [![](https://blogs.edf.org/markets/wp-content/blogs.dir/32/files//Graphic-NCS-Blog-1024x442.png)](https://blogs.edf.org/markets/wp-content/blogs.dir/32/files//Graphic-NCS-Blog.png)\n\nIn the context of NCS crediting, equity questions arise on both the demand and supply side. On supply, issues include the rights and priorities of communities generating credits, benefit sharing arrangements, and stakeholder consultation processes. On demand, these include the impacts of credit use on local co-pollutants, disparities in environmental burdens, and the distribution of benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUltimately, carbon pricing and crediting is valuable only insofar as it can effectively drive climate-friendly outcomes in an equitable manner.\u00a0\n\nIn some cases, supply and demand considerations may come into tension, for instance when credit usage could exacerbate a community\u2019s air pollution on the demand side but support local livelihoods on the supply side.\u00a0\n\nThough equity should ultimately be considered holistically, this paper focuses specifically on demand, digging into the details and evidence around the use of NCS credits. EDF\u2019s forthcoming [NCS Crediting Handbook](https://www.edf.org/natural-climate-solutions-and-carbon-crediting) will include a chapter on supply side issues, including a section on safeguards for people and the environment.\u00a0\n\nIt is important to note that some environmental justice and civil rights groups fundamentally oppose carbon pricing as it [favors economic efficiency over distributional equity](https://www.weact.org/2016/09/a-climate-game-changer/) and allows pollution to be paid for. Although these critiques cannot be corrected through modifications to policy design, they should be recognized and understood.\u00a0\n\n**Using NCS credits in compliance and voluntary markets**\u202f\u00a0\n\nUnderstanding the equity questions around NCS crediting, and taking actions to address them, is necessary to avoid negative outcomes for communities.\u00a0\n\nIn some countries and jurisdictions, emitters are regulated under pricing mechanisms like cap-and-trade or carbon taxation. Companies can often use carbon credits, including NCS credits, to meet a portion of these obligations. And in many cases, the equity considerations surrounding the use of NCS credits are the same as those for the use of emissions allowances.\u00a0\n\nIn these systems, companies may choose to pay for emissions allowances or credits when these are less expensive than direct emissions reductions. Since greenhouse gas emissions are strongly correlated with harmful co-pollutants, this could potentially maintain or exacerbate inequities in pollution exposure. Polluting facilities are disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color, meaning these groups could be particularly harmed.\u00a0\n\nWhile well-designed emissions trading has been shown to reduce overall emissions in regulated areas, the evidence on local environmental impacts is mixed. Several studies using different methodologies have examined the California cap-and-trade program, finding either the exacerbation or reduction of pollution burden in predominantly minority or low-income communities. A detailed analysis of this literature is available in the full paper. Outside of the US, little research assesses the impacts of emissions trading on community air quality.\u00a0\n\nThe use of credits and allowances raises the risk of extending the lifespan of fossil fuel infrastructure, with associated public health effects. For NCS credits in particular, mitigation potential is limited by the overall availability of ecosystems, meaning this is not an indefinite solution for fossil fuels.\u00a0\n\nAs for the voluntary carbon market, NCS credits offer one option for companies to voluntarily contribute to emissions reductions. To the extent that carbon credits are used to mask unsustainable practices, this could be considered a form of \u2018greenwashing.\u2019\u00a0\n\nThese issues can and must be addressed for effective, impactful use of NCS crediting.\u00a0\n\n**Promoting equitable outcomes**\u00a0\n\nNCS credits are an important tool for financing conservation, and several policy options help to promote the equitable use of these credits. For example, compliance markets often limit the percentage of an entities\u2019 obligation that can be met with credits. Under Washington State\u2019s [cap-and-trade](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.170&pdf=true), an entity\u2019s credit allowance may be further reduced if they \u201ccontribute substantively to cumulative air pollution burden in an overburdened community.\u201d In voluntary markets, credits could be used only for contribution beyond a company\u2019s value chain.\u00a0\n\nRevenues from emissions trading can also be recycled, including through tax rebates for low-income households, income or corporate tax reductions, or funding for renewable energy and infrastructure projects. [California Senate Bill 535](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/sb535) mandates that at least a quarter of the proceeds from the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program go to projects benefiting disadvantaged communities, with at least 10 percent of funds for projects directly located in disadvantaged communities.\n\nUltimately, carbon pricing and crediting is valuable only insofar as it can effectively drive climate-friendly outcomes in an equitable manner.\u00a0\n\n*The NCS Crediting Handbook will explore other components of equity and integrity, including questions around the generation and transaction of credits.

canopy](https://www.environmentalleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Planet-Forest-Tracking.jpg.webp)(Credit: Planet Labs)Planet Labs has announced plans to release its Forest Carbon Planetary Variable, a dataset that will provide insights into forest changes and carbon capture.\n\nThe modeling product will be able to analyze forest ecosystems nearly at the individual tree level. The tool will prove especially useful for voluntary carbon market participants, service providers dependent on forests in their supply chains, and regulators needing insights into changes in forest area and carbon stocks, to name a few. The dataset will also match the accuracy of physical and airborne measurements of forest cover and carbon at a much lower cost.\n\nA 30-meter resolution product will be released this year, and the company plans to also launch a [3-meter resolution product in 2024](https://learn.planet.com/forest-carbon-prerelease).\n\n\u201cOur Forest Carbon Planetary Variable represents a significant leap forward in carbon monitoring capabilities, and we\u2019re excited to offer it at such an accessible price to empower organizations to truly scale their understanding of forest change,\u201d said Planet Labs\u2019 President of Product and Business, Kevin Weil. \u201cWith its high resolution, accuracy, and frequency, Planet\u2019s Forest Carbon sets a new industry standard that will enable more informed decision-making and drive effective climate action worldwide.\u201d\n\n [![](https://static.environmentalleader.com/645015b1d9767a179775a770265270f8.png)](https://ads.environmentalleader.com/www/delivery/cl.php?bannerid=7361&zoneid=272&sig=dde46187b5006cb3c81b1f1e716209cea2d2624dbe4aef88c069d88e826edd4d&oadest=https%3A%2F%2Fevents.zoom.us%2Fev%2FAl5n1Ep1ox-fuR7yq3oWsGb_prHVdZ73pL5YezY34Kl6wv6av4XJ%7EAggLXsr32QYFjq8BlYLZ5I06Dg%3Futm_source%3DWebsite%26utm_medium%3DBanner%26utm_campaign%3DEESummit23)![](https://ads.environmentalleader.com/www/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=7361&campaignid=2820&zoneid=272&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.environmentalleader.com%2F2023%2F08%2Fplanet-labs-releases-forest-carbon-dataset%2F&cb=de3b5a7b0d)\n[![](http://ads.environmentalleader.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=272&cb=&n=abab4b2c)](http://ads.environmentalleader.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=abab4b2c&cb=)Importance of Accurate Carbon Monitoring for Greenwashing Prevention\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlanet Labs\u2019 new tool will provide frequent and granular data that contributes to accurate carbon monitoring, helping [limit fraud and other greenwashing tactics](https://www.environmentalleader.com/2023/03/cse-net-zero-climate-commitments-ambitious-goals-or-greenwashing/). The company also aims to make transparency affordable by offering the product at as low as $0.10 per hectare.\n\nThe World Economic Forum claims the voluntary [carbon market lacks transparency](https://www.environmentalleader.com/2023/08/blockchain-technology-adds-transparency-and-integrity-to-carbon-markets/), so various technologies like these are being developed and adopted to better monitor them. With such carbon-tracking abilities, companies can show stakeholders exactly where carbon credits derive.\n\nWith the Forest Carbon tool, data can be collected on aboveground live carbon, canopy height, and canopy cover. It will also be updated quarterly to ensure up-to-date decision-making for its stakeholders.\n\n\nCategories [Air &

With [carbon offsetting demands growing](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/major-increase-in-carbon-offsetting-thanks-to-greta-thunberg-effect-2/) to accommodate net-zero targets, the independent body aims to issue labelled credits by the end of the year.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe global carbon offset market is unregulated, which makes it hard for companies to gauge which credits are good, with questions over the industry\u2019s poor transparency and the environmental quality of projects. To combat this, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) has published its criteria for projects to achieve its new [Core Carbon Principles](https://icvcm.org/the-core-carbon-principles/) (CCPs).\n\n\nSpeaking to [FoodNavigator](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2023/08/11/Carbon-market-gives-clearer-rules-on-offsetting), an ICVCM spokesperson said: \u201cThe past year has seen a number of companies withdraw from earlier commitments to purchase carbon credits as concerns mounted over the quality of credits on the market.\u201d\n\n\nThey added that the issue wasn\u2019t a lack of good carbon credits, but rather a difficulty for buyers to distinguish between the good and the bad. The sector is filled with bilateral transactions, with minimal standardisation and no central exchange, meaning companies must carry out extensive due diligence in-house. Some have found that the credits they bought turned out to be of lower quality than they initially thought. \u201cThis has reduced confidence and purchases, which ultimately means less finance for projects to reduce and remove carbon emissions,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\u201cIt is expected that this [new guideline] will give buyers greater confidence and drive up both purchases and prices for high-quality credits, increasing finance for impactful projects and providing incentives for developers to improve standards,\u201d they added.\n\n\n\n\nThe result of a 60-day deliberation between stakeholders in the voluntary carbon market and scientific and industry experts, the 10 core principles are spread into three categories: emissions impact, governance and sustainable development. Additionality, permanence, robust quantification and prohibiting double counting make up the first part, while effective governance, tracking, transparency and third-party validation and verification compose the governance category. The last one, meanwhile, involves sustainable development benefits and safeguards, and contributions towards net-zero transition.\n\n\nCurrently, it isn\u2019t mandatory for a business retiring a carbon credit to disclose its name, but under the new standards, registries retiring CCP credits will need to identify on whose behalf the credits have been retired. And once a credit has been retired, it can\u2019t be traded or used to meet climate targets by another company.\n\n\n\u2018Carbon-neutral\u2019 claims and greenwashing concerns\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAccording to FoodNavigator, the carbon credit framework advises companies to follow a \u2018climate contribution\u2019 approach, where \u201ccarbon credits are not counted towards, nor represent compensation for, a company\u2019s remaining value chain emissions\u201d.\u200b It refers to using credits for climate mitigation, rather than making claims that a company has canceled, counterbalanced or netted out its emissions.\n\n\nA spokesperson from climate action organisation [Science Based Targets Initiative](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) said this could lead to pushback against carbon-neutral claims, historically the most widely used climate-related \u2018achievement\u2019 used by businesses. The term can have multiple connotations \u2013 some feel it can facilitate a company\u2019s climate mitigation action beyond its value chain, while others find it conceals the impact of firms that haven\u2019t decarbonised.\n\n\n\n![carbon offsetting](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAMAAQMAAACAdIdOAAAAA1BMVEUAAACnej3aAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAFiS0dEAIgFHUgAAAB2SURBVBgZ7cEBAQAAAIKg/q92SMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIB7AYMPAAECmJwtAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)![carbon offsetting](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stop-Using-Carbon-Offsets-To-Avoid-Emissions-Cuts-Says-Greenpeace.jpg)Courtesy: Pexels\nThis confusion has also led to a reduction in carbon credit investment out of fear of being accused of greenwashing. It echoes a [recent poll](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/greenwashing-marketing-professionals-sustainability-campaigns-training-wualificatin/) by the [Chartered Institute of Marketing](https://www.cim.co.uk/newsroom/release-consumer-focus-on-sustainability-outstrips-marketers-current-skill-set-with-half-still-fearful-of-greenwashing/)\u00a0that revealed that 45% of marketing professionals have come under pressure from clients to provide more \u2018green\u2019 marketing, but the demand for such campaigns is outpacing education in this sector.\n\n\nMany of the surveyed marketers don\u2019t feel comfortable working on such projects as they fear they\u2019ll be accused of greenwashing, and almost half (49%) said they had spoken to their employer or client about the reputational and legal risks accusations of greenwashing have brought in the last five years.\n\n\nCompanies have been using carbon offsets \u2013 which include measures like tree planting \u2013 to cut emissions and meet their net-zero plans for years, but this practice has been criticised by many experts, [including Greenpeace](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/greenpeace-carbon-offsets/). One argument is that there [aren\u2019t enough trees](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/there-arent-enough-trees-in-the-world-offset-societys-carbon-emissions-there-never-will-be/) in the world to offset everybody\u2019s emissions, and there likely never will be.\n\n\n\u201cWe do expect this will have a significant impact on the market,\u201d ICVCM COO William McDonnell \u00a0told\u00a0[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/global-standards-launched-boost-2-bln-voluntary-carbon-market-2023-07-26/), \u201cbut we can\u2019t prejudge the pre-designed assessment process we are about to start.\u201d\n\n\n  \n[![APAC 2022 Article Banner](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAB4AAAADdAQAAAAByblLMAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAABKSURBVHja7cExAQAAAMKg9U9tCy+gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4GzQDQABO+wqCgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)![APAC 2022 Article Banner](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/APAC-2022-Report-Article-Banner.png)](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/apac-alt-protein-report-2022/) ", "summaries": [{"summary": "The Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) has released guidance to help companies choose better carbon credits and introduce more transparency in the unregulated market.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "The guidance will give buyers greater confidence and drive up purchases and prices for high-quality credits, increasing finance for impactful projects and providing incentives for developers to improve standards."}, {"summary": "The ICVCM has published the Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) as criteria for projects in the voluntary carbon market.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The principles aim to address issues related to emissions impact, governance, sustainable development, and contributions towards net-zero transition."}, {"summary": "Under the new standards, registries retiring CCP credits will need to disclose the name of the business and the credits cannot be traded or used by another company.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The disclosure requirement aims to increase transparency and prevent double counting of credits."}, {"summary": "The carbon credit framework advises companies to use credits for climate mitigation rather than making claims of carbon neutrality.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The approach aims to address confusion and concerns related to greenwashing and the impact of firms that haven't decarbonized."}, {"summary": "Greenwashing concerns and confusion have led to a reduction in carbon credit investment, as companies fear accusations of greenwashing.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Companies are reluctant to invest in carbon credits due to reputational and legal risks associated with greenwashing accusations."}, {"summary": "The use of carbon offsets, such as tree planting, to meet net-zero plans has been criticized by experts due to concerns over its effectiveness.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Critics argue that there are not enough trees in the world to offset everyone's emissions, making the practice insufficient."}], "semantic_commentary": "ICVCM guidance promotes transparency in carbon credit market.", "sentiment_score": -0.16666666666666666, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions systems, policies, and products related to removing carbon from the atmosphere, such as carbon credits and carbon neutrality."}, {"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions companies committing to reducing their carbon footprint, purchasing carbon credits, and aiming for net-zero plans."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, including the release of guidance, standards, and concerns related to carbon credits and tree planting."}]}, {"source": "Mondaq", "link": "https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/commoditiesderivativesstock-exchanges/1355402/cftc-urges-potential-whistleblowers-to-report-carbon-credit-misconduct", "title": "CFTC Urges Potential Whistleblowers To Report Carbon Credit Misconduct -

Carbon\ncredits are the underlying commodity for futures contracts that are\nlisted on CFTC designated contract markets (DCMs). The commission\nhas enforcement authority and regulatory oversight over DCMs and\nany trading in those markets.\n\n\nThe alert directs individuals with a potential CEA claim to\ncomplete a\u00a0**[Form TCR (Tip, Complaint,\nReferral)](https://www.whistleblower.gov/overview/submitatip)**\u00a0on the CFTC's Whistleblower\nProgram website. Whistleblowers may be eligible for confidentiality\nand anti-retaliation protections, as well as an award of between\n10% and 30% of the monetary sanctions collected from a subsequent\nenforcement action. Whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC\nCustomer Protection Fund, which is financed through monetary\nsanctions paid to the commission. Since 2014, the CFTC has granted\nwhistleblower awards totaling approximately $330 million. Awards\nassociated with enforcement actions have resulted in monetary\nsanctions totaling more than $3 billion.\n\n\n**Taking the Temperature: The CFTC's whistleblower\nalert follows a request by a group of Democratic senators in\nOctober 2022 that the Commission improve regulation of the carbon\ncredits market,\u00a0[as we previously reported](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=15&nid=3). The carbon credit\nmarket has grown\u2014and is expected to continue to grow\u2014\nrapidly, as the world aims to reach net zero goals by 2050.\nEstimates of the value of the market vary widely.\u00a0[According to a report issued by Morgan\nStanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/carbon-offset-market-growth)\u00a0in April of this year, the voluntary carbon\noffsets market is expected to grow from approximately $2 billion in\n2022 to $100 billion by 2030, and to $250 billion by\n2050.**\n\n\n**However, the carbon offset market has come under heavy\nscrutiny, including\u00a0[by the United Nations](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/high-level_expert_group_n7b.pdf)\u00a0and\u00a0[at COP27](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=51&nid=10)\u00a0in November 2022, with critics\n(including the Democratic senators in their letter) pointing to the\npotential for companies to engage in greenwashing and the risk that\ncarbon credits may in fact reduce incentives for corporations to\nactively work towards carbon reduction. As the Democratic\nsenators' letter points out: \u201cThe purchase of offsets\nallows many of these multinational companies to make bold claims\nabout emission reductions and pledges to reach \u2018net\nzero,' when in fact they are taking little action to address\nthe climate impacts of their industry. Several studies have\nhighlighted that carbon offset projects are frequently\nillegitimate, and those that do contribute to meaningful emissions\nreductions are often representative of broader \u2018pay to\npollute' schemes that place profit over protecting frontline\ncommunities.\u201d**\n\n\n**The letter exhorted the CTFC to take action across a\nnumber of fronts, including \u201c[p]ursu[ing] cases of individual\nproject fraud,\u201d and \u201c[d]evelop[ing] a working group to\nstudy both the risk to investors associated with carbon offsets and\nderivatives (legal, reputational, and regulatory) and the systemic\nclimate financial risk created by their availability and\nusage.\u201d The senators closed by reminding the CTFC that it\n\u201chas a duty to promote the integrity of U.S. markets through\nsound regulation and to hold companies accountable for fraud or\nmisrepresentation, and we urge you to set meaningful standards to\naddress these issues in the offset market.\u201d The decision by\nthe CTFC to bring carbon credits within their whistleblowing awards\nremit indicates that it may be starting to comply with calls to act\nto prevent fraud associated with carbon credits.\u00a0[As we have previously discussed](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=292&nid=68), it remains\nunclear how the CFTC would exercise its regulatory authority in\npractice and what the implications are for the developments of\nvoluntary carbon markets. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\nis also paying close attention to potential fraud in the carbon\ncredit trading markets, has\u00a0[established an information and reporting\nportal](https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/carbon-credit-trading-scams#:~:text=Carbon%20credits%20are%20not%20currently,if%20you%20want%20to%20complain.)\u00a0and has\u00a0[taken enforcement action](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/paul-seakens-2022.pdf)\u00a0against\nindividuals using carbon credits to defraud investors.**\n\n\n**[As we have noted](https://www.cadwalader.com/cwt-climate/index.php?eid=58&nid=11), the regulation of the carbon\noffset market is a topic of international interest, with the\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), an\ninternational policy forum for securities regulators, announcing\nthe publication of a consultation report and discussion paper on\ncarbon markets in November 2022, and publishing its final report\non\u00a0[\u201cCompliance Carbon\nMarkets\u201d](https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD740.pdf)\u00a0just last month, in July 2023.**\n\n\n*The content of this article is intended to provide a general\nguide to the subject matter.

Specifically, this entity, among other things, allegedly contravened the *Emission Management Act* by providing false information and lacked the necessary qualifications to provide their verification service.\n\n\n**Compliance Obligations**\n\n\nTIER, which is enacted under the *Emission Management Act*, implements Alberta's industrial carbon pricing and emissions trading system and regulates: (i) facilities that emit 100,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide per year; (ii) facilities that emit 2,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide per year and have voluntarily opted-in to TIER; or (iii) owners or operators of two or more conventional oil and gas facilities, who have applied to have their facility regulated by TIER (each a **Regulated Facility**).\n\n\nTIER prescribes a \u201cperson responsible\u201d for each Regulated Facility, and requires such person to submit annual compliance reports, detailing how the Regulated Facility has met its greenhouse gas (**GHG**) emission reduction requirements required by TIER.\n\n\nSuch GHG emission reduction requirements can be achieved in a number of ways including: (i) physically abating GHG emissions from such Regulated Facility; (ii) submitting emission offsets (**Emission Offsets**); (iii) submitting emission performance credits (**EPCs**); (iv) converting Emission Offsets into sequestration credits (**Sequestration Credits**) and then submitting them; (v) purchasing fund credits (**Fund Credits**) by paying into a TIER fund at an annual per tonne price prescribed by TIER (which, as of 2023 is $65/tonne); or (vi) subject to certain restrictions, any permutation of (i) through (v) above.\n\n\nTIER is not only relevant to Regulated Facilities and the persons responsible for them. Project proponents of Emission Offset producing facilities must comply with certain TIER requirements as well. Such facilities, if operated in accordance with TIER prescribed GHG quantification protocols, can generate Emission Offsets which can be sold to a person responsible for a Regulated Facility so that such Emission Offset can be used to achieve the annual compliance obligations in respect of such Regulated Facility.\n\n\nA key feature of TIER is the requirement for persons responsible for Regulated Facilities and Emission Offset project proponents, to have their TIER prescribed filings scrutinized by an entity accredited as a verification body to the ISO Standard 14065:2013 (a **Third Party Assurance Provider**). Accordingly, Third Party Assurance Providers play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of TIER\u2019s industrial carbon pricing and emission trading system.\n\n\n**The Charges**\n\n\nAmberg Corp. (**Amberg**) and Olga Kiiker (**Kiiker**) face the following 25 charges for actions alleged to have occurred between April 1, 2021 and June 29, 2021:\n\n\n* 1 charge under section 44(a) of [the *Emission Management Act*](https://canlii.ca/t/56128) for knowingly providing false or misleading information pursuant to a requirement under *Emission Management Act* or the regulations to provide information;\n* 1 charge under section 44(b) of *Emission Management Act* for providing false or misleading information pursuant to a requirement under *Emission Management Act* or the regulations to provide information;\n* 11 charges under section 33(b) of TIER for failing to comply with the rules and other requirements set out in Part 1 of the Standard for Validation, Verification and Audit, in providing a verification referred to in section 15(4)(e) of TIER contrary to section 15(6); and\n* 12 charges under section 33(f) of TIER for performing the functions of a third party assurance provider and not having the qualifications, or is not eligible to be a third party assurance provider under section 27.\n\n\nEach of the charges carry the potential for penalties, ranging between $50,000 - $100,000 for an individual and $500,000 - $1,000,000 for a corporation. Should Amberg and Kiiker be found guilty in respect of all 25 charges, Amberg could be liable for up to $13,000,000 in penalties and Kiiker, individually, could be liable for up to $1,450,000. Although unlikely, the charges against Kiiker, as an individual, also bring the risk of up to two years in prison.\n\n\n**The Role of Environmental Reporting in the Carbon Credit System**\n\n\nThe legitimacy and validity of TIER required filings and any EPCs, Emission Offsets or Sequestration Credits referenced therein, is critical to Alberta\u2019s carbon market.\n\n\nIn the case where an EPC, Emission Offset or Sequestration Credit referenced in an annual compliance report is subsequently found to be invalid, the person responsible for the Regulated Facility to which such compliance report pertains must, within 60 days of receiving notice of the cancellation or direction from AEPA, do one of the following:\n\n\n* pay into the TIER Fund an amount equal to the amount it would have had to contribute to obtain one fund credit for the year the invalidated Emission Offset, EPC or Sequestration Credit was used; or\n* use another unused Emission Offset, EPC, or Sequestration Credit, in place of the invalidated Emission Offset, EPC or Sequestration Credit.\n\n\nIt is important to note that such curative requirements are operative notwithstanding that such invalidated Emission Offset, EPC or Sequestration Credit may have been verified by a Third Party Assurance Provider, as required under TIER. Such verification, while indicative of the validity of such credits, is not conclusively determinative of their validity.\n\n\nAccordingly, it is critical for those transacting in any Emission Offsets, EPCs or Sequestration Credits to not view successful verification as a substitute for the proper allocation of invalidation risk as between buyer and seller in the operative transaction documents.\n\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "Alberta Environment and Protected Areas (AEPA) has charged an environmental services company for providing false information and lacking necessary qualifications in connection with compliance reporting under the Emissions Management and Climate Resilience Act.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The company is charged with providing false information and lacking qualifications, indicating wrongdoing."}, {"summary": "Amberg Corp. and Olga Kiiker face multiple charges under TIER for failing to comply with rules and requirements and for not having the necessary qualifications to be a third-party assurance provider.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "The defendants are charged with multiple violations and not meeting the necessary qualifications to perform their role."}, {"summary": "If an EPC, Emission Offset, or Sequestration Credit mentioned in an annual compliance report is found to be invalid, the person responsible must either pay into the TIER Fund or use another valid credit in its place.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The requirement to rectify invalid credits is a standard procedure, without any strongly positive or negative implications."}], "semantic_commentary": "Relevance: Emphasizes the importance of valid carbon credits for compliance.", "sentiment_score": -0.6666666666666666, "classifications": [{"category": "category_s1", "reason": "The article mentions compliance reporting under the Emissions Management and Climate Resilience Act, which relates to systems and policies for carbon removal."}, {"category": "category_o1", "reason": "The article is about charges against an environmental services company and individuals, not directly related to carbon."}]}, {"source": "ET EnergyWorld", "link": "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/opinion-why-there-is-an-urgency-for-india-to-roll-out-its-carbon-market/102749033", "title": "OPINION: Why there is an urgency for India to roll out its carbon market, ET EnergyWorld", "content": "\n\nX\n\n\nWe use cookies to ensure best experience for you\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalize content and targeted ads, analyze site traffic, and understand where our audience is coming from.

CCTS is a key intervention for achieving the pledge of reducing our emission intensity by 45 per cent by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels. India stands out in firmly implementing its energy transition. In the recently held Clean Energy Ministerial in Goa, I had the honour of sharing energy transition action plan of India along with four other major countries. I can say with full confidence that India has the most concrete action plan in implementation.  \n  \n\n\nAdvt\n\n\n\n\n\nCCTS notification not only lays down institutional responsibilities for various actions to be taken but it also clarifies the market design and the procedure for target setting for rolling out the carbon market. The two most significant features of CCTS are targets in terms of emission intensity, and exclusion of voluntary mechanism from issue of carbon credits.  \n  \nAs India is a developing country, its industrial output is bound to grow. Therefore, CCTS proposes targets in terms of emission per unit of product, unlike developed economies where targets or cap is in terms of total emissions. Secondly, though the draft CCTS proposal contained both compliance and voluntary mechanisms for issue of carbon credits, final notification provides for issue of carbon credits to only the entities which are obligated under compliance mechanism for their achievement beyond the target emission intensity. Adhering to only the compliance mechanism would give a clear policy focus on attracting investment in comparatively expensive and need-to-be-scaled-up technologies in hard to abate sectors. Permitting oversupply of carbon credits produced at comparatively lower costs from voluntary mechanism projects would have disincentivised investment in emerging expensive technologies which are crucial for decarbonisation of our industries.  \n  \nCCTS also has provision for Accredited Carbon Verification Agencies which are to be empaneled by [Bureau of Energy Efficiency](/tag/bureau+of+energy+efficiency). Standardised and rigorous verification of emission intensity reduction through global standard Verification Agencies , coupled with credits being issued only to such obligated agencies which make actual investments in hard to abate sectors is sure to make credits traded in India Carbon Market highly credible and worldwide acceptable. This will be very positive in the context of mechanisms like CBAM.   \n  \nCCTS market design has both similarities and dissimilarities when compared to PAT programme. Both CCTS and PAT are compliance mechanism based frameworks providing for credits for achievement over and above targets by obligated entities. Both have targets in terms of specific reduction per unit of product. But there are significant differences. While PAT trading was within closed group of obligated entities , CCTS has provision of registered entities who can buy credits thus discovering good value for carbon credits. Buyers can even be from other countries, as and when permitted by the central Government. PAT measured the achievement only in terms of reduction in energy intensity while CCTS will permit multiple option of technologies for emission intensity reduction including fuel switch, process modifications etc. Thus, CCTS would provide a market-based platform for discovering the true value of investment in multiple green technologies. It will also facilitate optimisation of investments based on transparently discovered carbon pricing.  \n  \n\n\nAdvt\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, certain steps are required to be taken urgently before we see actual trading of carbon credits. There are certain procedural steps such as formulation of detailed procedures by [National Steering Committee](/tag/national+steering+committee) for [Indian Carbon Market](/tag/indian+carbon+market). It will need close and continuous coordination between the [Ministry of Power](/tag/ministry+of+power) and the [Ministry of Environment](/tag/ministry+of+environment), Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).   \n  \nHowever, most crucial action required is identification of sectors for imposing obligations in terms of emission intensity reduction and proposing actual targets for obligated entities in these sectors. We have to keep in mind the lessons learnt from PAT while setting targets. PAT targets were too soft resulting in glut of Energy Saving Certificates( ECerts) which led to serious under recovery of investments for over-achievers. For example, in PAT I Cycle, 31.17 lac ECerts were available for sale whereas the mandate to buy for underachievers was only for 13.01 lac ECerts. This over supply led to a discovery of price of just Rs 250 per certificate. The Central Government had to intervene and a floor price was mandated in August 2022. Even then, the discovered price in trade in period May to July in year 2023 was just at floor price of Rs 1,840. The actual cost of emission reduction is of the order of several thousand rupees per tonnes of CO2 emissions in hard to abate sectors if one has to invest in technologies like Green Hydrogen or CCUS.  \n  \nTherefore targets need to be practical but reasonably tough. Industrial units will also take some minimum time to make investments in new technologies. Therefore targets for initial few yearly cycles will have to be kept moderate but with clear visibility of stiffer targets in subsequent years, only then businesses will take investment decisions.  \n  \nSuch targets, once proposed by Bureau will be required to be notified by MoEFCC under Environment Protection Act. Therefore, notifying a well calibrated trajectory of emission intensity reduction targets is a time taking task and needs to be completed at the earliest. Industrial units will not start making investments in green technologies in the absence of the targets because first mover would see it priced out in the market.  \n  \n**[This piece was written exclusively for ETEnergyworld by [Alok Kumar](/tag/alok+kumar), former Secretary, Ministry of Power, Government of India]**   \n \n* By \n Alok Kumar\n,\n* [ETEnergyWorld](/agency/88675631/ETEnergyWorld)\n\n\n* Published On Aug 15, 2023 at 06:04 PM IST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* \n* \n* \n* + Telegram\n\t+ Facebook\n\t+ Copy Link\n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-no-comments.svg)\n\nBe the first one to comment.\nComment Now\n\n\nCOMMENTS\n--------\n\n\n\n\nComment Now\nRead Comment (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Comments\n------------\n\n\n\n\nPost\n\n\n\n\n\nPost\n\n\n\nFind this Comment Offensive?\n----------------------------\n\n\nChoose your reason below and click on the submit button.

That\u2019s a better noncompliance rate than the 20% projection the city forecast for the initial compliance period, which runs from 2024 to 2029.\n\nThe law requires structures larger than 25,000 square feet to cut their carbon emissions starting in January 2024. Buildings that don\u2019t comply will have to pay up to $268 per ton of carbon equivalent over their limit. For the worst emitters, that could add up to millions of dollars per year.\n\n\u201cThis shows that the law is having its desired effect, that building owners are finding the resources and the technologies to come into compliance, and that they are taking it seriously,\u201d Aggarwala said.\n\nThe progress is partly the result of retrofit work and sustainability upgrades that have already been done at large buildings across the city, according to a DEP spokesman.\n\nIt\u2019s also the result of a city-run accelerator program that advises buildings on how they can become more energy efficient, as well as the fact that \u201ca lot of these things pay for themselves,\u201d Aggarwala said.\n\nPete Sikora, climate and inequality campaigns director at New York Communities for Change, said buildings that were very wasteful have the biggest opportunity to cut emissions through simple fixes such as insulating exposed heating pipes, tuning their boilers, operating their HVAC systems properly, or switching to LED light bulbs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really basic stuff that they should have already been doing,\u201d Sikora said. \u201cIn many buildings, people don\u2019t do it because inertia takes over and you just run the building like you always have. It\u2019s human nature. But the law gives them a kick in the pants to get this done.\u201d\n\nFor that reason, Sikora said the city\u2019s findings didn\u2019t strike him as a big surprise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fair, pretty easily achievable initial limit, so it makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a part of me that\u2019s breathing a little easier. On this present trend, the law will be a spectacular success.\u201d\n\nJohn Mandyck, CEO of the Urban Green Council, agreed, saying the new findings show that \u201cLocal Law 97 is working. It\u2019s sending a market signal and the market hears it.\u201d\n\nDisadvantaged Communities\n-------------------------\n\nAggarwala expressed dismay that many of the buildings that aren\u2019t in compliance are in disadvantaged communities.\n\nFines under Local Law 97 could be ruinous to middle- and low-income tenants, because the costs may be passed down in the form of increased rents and other fees, according to Geoffrey Mazel, a board member and an attorney with Homeowners for a Stronger New York.\n\nBut Local Law 97 contains provisions for buildings that are making a good faith effort to comply, and City Hall under Mayor Eric Adams (D) is now developing rules on how those efforts will be assessed. Those draft regulations are expected within \u201ca few weeks,\u201d Aggarwala said.\n\nHe also said most of the buildings that are out of compliance are only short by 10% to 20% of their goals. The emissions caps vary across 60 property types, as well as a given building\u2019s size.\n\nBut many more buildings are out of compliance with the next set of reduction targets that start in 2030, \u201cso they have much more difficult, much more expensive, deep retrofits that they will have to do,\u201d Aggarwala said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, some of those do not pay for themselves.\u201d\n\nOpposition From Real Estate\n---------------------------\n\nThe law has come under fire from the city\u2019s real estate sector and Republican lawmakers, who have consistently said many buildings will struggle to comply, often echoing Aggarwala\u2019s observation about buildings in disadvantaged communities.\n\nTo help buildings facing stiff fines, city council member Vickie Paladino (R) recently introduced a [bill](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6013724&GUID=E923FF1B-E248-43E4-85E6-56E7F95A2046) that would delay the financial penalties by seven years.\n\nThe powerful Real Estate Board of New York said in January that fines on property owners could exceed $900 million each year by 2030. \n\nZach Steinberg, senior vice president of policy at REBNY, said the group is encouraged that more building owners are taking steps to reduce emissions, but that it also wants to review the city\u2019s data before the fines start kicking in. \n\n\u201cWith financial penalties on the horizon for many buildings next year and tens of thousand more in 2030, we look forward to reviewing the City\u2019s data as we work to effectively fulfill the goals of Local Law 97,\u201d he said.\n\nA handful of other cities have building performance laws on the books, but New York stands alone because of the number of buildings it contains. More than two thirds of the city\u2019s 56.5 million tons of annual carbon emissions come from its buildings sector, mostly linked to lighting, heating, cooling, and appliance usage.\n\n\u201cYou can fix any building\u2014it\u2019s a matter of how much money you want to deploy to get that building up to code,\u201d said Adam Kramer, CEO of nZero, a software company that has been working with New York property owners to understand their Local Law 97 compliance obligations. \u201cIn some cases it\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult because you\u2019re not looking at just one thing.\u201d\n\nOne concern for local Democratic officials and their allies in the environmental world is that the Adams administration may weaken the law when his administration issues the next set of implementing regulations.\n\nThe law gives Adams some discretion to relax penalties, although he could also face legal challenges from environmentalists if he attempted that. The mayor doesn\u2019t have the authority to alter Local Law 97\u2019s formula for calculating penalties.\n\n", "summaries": [{"summary": "New York City's largest buildings are complying with emissions laws at a faster rate than expected, debunking claims that the rules are too difficult to meet.", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_reason": "Building owners are finding resources and technologies to comply, and progress is being made through sustainability upgrades and retrofit work."}, {"summary": "A report shows that 11% of buildings in New York City are not on track to meet the emission reduction requirements.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "There is noncompliance, indicating that some buildings are struggling or unwilling to comply."}, {"summary": "Buildings larger than 25,000 square feet that don't comply with emissions reductions will face fines.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "The law has provisions for good faith efforts to comply and is currently developing rules for assessing compliance efforts."}, {"summary": "The law is especially burdening buildings in disadvantaged communities, which could result in increased costs for middle- and low-income tenants.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Fines may lead to higher rents and fees, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations."}, {"summary": "There are concerns that the next set of reduction targets starting in 2030 will be more challenging and expensive for buildings to comply with.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "Future reduction targets will be more difficult and costly, potentially impacting compliance rates."}, {"summary": "The real estate sector has opposed the law, claiming many buildings will struggle to comply.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "Opposition from real estate and Republican lawmakers suggests skepticism about the feasibility of compliance."}, {"summary": "Local Law 97 is unique due to New York City's large number of buildings and its significant carbon emissions from the buildings sector.", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_reason": "New York City's scale and emissions make its building performance laws distinct."}, {"summary": "There are concerns that the Adams administration may weaken the law when issuing implementing regulations.", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_reason": "There is potential for the law to be weakened, which worries local officials and environmentalists."}], "semantic_commentary": "11% of NYC buildings not meeting emissions requirements; concern over future targets.", "sentiment_score": -0.375, "classifications": [{"category": "category_d1", "reason": "The article mentions that buildings that don't comply with emissions reductions will face fines, indicating a commitment to reducing carbon footprint."}, {"category": "category_n1", "reason": "The article mentions news about carbon, specifically related to emissions reduction requirements and carbon emissions from buildings."}]}, {"source": "Kuwait Times", "link": "https://www.kuwaittimes.com/the-next-big-market-emissions-trading/", "title": "The next big market: Emissions trading - Kuwait Times", "content": "\n**By Zaid Aboobacker**\n\n\n**KUWAIT:** Step into the world of carbon credits. Picture this: A permit granting countries and organizations a set carbon emission limit. But here\u2019s where it gets intriguing \u2013 if they don\u2019t use up their allowance, they can trade it. Imagine a company selling its unused emissions to another that\u2019s gone overboard their emission limits. In simple words, carbon credits grant organizations the right to emit a certain amount of CO2 annually, acting as a regulatory framework which allows countries to stay within their emission control goals.\n\n\n**Emission trading systems**\n\n\nCarbon markets mainly fall into two types: Compliance and voluntary. Compliance markets emerge due to the presence of national, regional and/or global policies or regulatory obligations. These are obligatory responsibilities that businesses must meet. Voluntary carbon markets, both at the national and international levels, refer to the voluntary trading, purchasing and selling of carbon credits. The current supply of voluntary carbon credits comes mostly from private organizations that develop carbon projects, or governments with certified programs that reduce emissions and/or removals.\n\n\nDemand is generated by businesses with sustainability goals, private individuals looking to offset their carbon footprints and other parties looking to profit by trading credits. One of the first tradable emission offset mechanisms is the 1997 US Clean Air Act. This act enabled a permitted facility to increase emissions if it compensated by paying another company to cut emissions by an equal or greater amount.\n\n\nThis act laid the groundwork for a mesmerizing dance of emission trading that echoes across subnational, national, and international stages. In 2023, under India\u2019s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, entities exceeding emission limits now face a choice: Pay a penalty or embrace responsible practices. Programs like California\u2019s Cap Trade Program cover about 85 percent of statewide GHG emissions. One of the biggest emission trading systems is the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS), which witnessed emission allowances from \u20ac12.4 per ton by the end of 2010 to a jaw-dropping \u20ac100.3 per metric ton of CO? by 2023.\n\n\n[![](https://www.kuwaittimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20002-300x297.jpeg)](https://www.kuwaittimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20002.jpeg)**Nadine Mustafa**\n**Carbon offset schemes for carbon credit**\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about carbon offset schemes \u2014 these schemes are programs which produce credits in exchange for funding programs that offset carbon emissions. Carbon credits and offsets are produced from diverse projects like fuel switching, energy efficiency, reforestation and renewable energy. In practice, a developed country can fund a greenhouse gas reduction project in a developing country. As a result, the developed country receives credit for achieving its carbon reduction goals, while the developing country receives funding for projects, technologies or a favorable change in land use. This falls under the Clean Development Mechanism, a UN-administered carbon offset initiative. CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for Inte\n\n\nrnational Aviation, represents a global initiative aimed at limiting international aviation emissions, which also establishes a framework for generating credits and offsets on a global scale. The REDD+ program is another international program that aims to monetize landowners to refrain from deforestation or degradation. In doing so, the program fosters a collaborative balance between conservation and compensation. Dr Nadine Moustafa, a PhD researcher specializing in carbon capture technologies, said: \u201cShould Kuwait embark on implementing such a scheme, it must brace itself for an ongoing and vigilant monitoring process.\n\n\nEmbracing an emissions trading scheme becomes especially pivotal if Kuwait intends to embrace industrial innovation, championing technologies like carbon capture and storage.\u201d Some carbon markets are implementing blockchain technology for processes like tracking carbon credit transactions or monitoring, reporting and verification. This can improve the auditability of emission-reduction project data, streamlining verification processes, thus reducing transaction costs and enhancing trust among market participants, according to the World bank.\n\n\n**Value of Credits**\n\n\nHow are the carbon credits valued? How can we ensure the quality of a carbon credit? How do we determine the value of a carbon credit produced by a carbon offset program? We will all answer it here. A number of factors can affect the prices of the value of the credits produced in an offset program. Project development costs and certification from a respected organization, projects that absorb CO2 and projects with added social and environmental advantages can all command a higher price. Carbon credits with older vintages tend to be valued lower on the market. The vintage is the year in which the carbon emissions reduction project generates the carbon offset credit. Certification programs are a key component of this community. In 2022, voluntary carbon market prices ranged from $8 to $30 per ton of CO2 for the most common types of offset projects.\n\n\n**Risks of the current market**\n\n\nDr Moustafa also informed Kuwait Times about potential drawbacks and uncertainties such as carbon leakage, overallocation of credits, lack of additionality and inaccurate emission accounting. She added it is important to note that these risks can be managed and mitigated through proper design and transparency.\n\n\n **Carbon credit for Kuwait**\n\n\nKuwait has huge potential to implement this into their system in the future, according to Shariq Ahmed, who works as an HSE Specialist in a Kuwait petroleum company. \u201cSeveral factors could influence the implementation and success of carbon credits or an emission trading system, as Kuwait\u2019s economy profoundly depend on oil exports, and the oil industry is a major supplier to its carbon emissions.\n\n\nThe availability of technologies for monitoring and reporting emissions is important for an effective ETS or carbon credit system. Precise measurement is necessary to ensure the integrity of emission reductions,\u201d he said. Kuwait Finance House supported the first carbon offset platform in 2021. Its aim was to mitigate carbon emissions by increasing tree plantings and starting new environmental projects.

Powers](/authors/151-mary-b-powers), [Debra K. Rubin](/authors/96-debra-rubin)\n\n![OUTSIDLongridge_ENRready.jpg](//www.enr.com/ext/resources/2023/08/15/OUTSIDLongridge_ENRready.jpg?1692133002)\nThe 485-MW Long Ridge combined cycle \nnatural gas power plant in Hannibal, Ohio, which started operating in 2021, is set to burn up to 50% hydrogen fuel and will \neventually transition to 100%. It is the first such U.S. facility to \nhave the hydrogen blend.\n\n\n*Photo:**Kiewit Corp.*\n\n\n\n\nAugust 15, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed rule to cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants is too ambitious considering the state of emerging technologies it relies on, said utilities, grid operators, unions and state regulators as well as some environmental advocates and others, in hundreds of comments filed as the agency moves to finalize its sweeping plan to replace a Trump administration regulation.\u00a0\n\nBut in review of responses delivered to EPA by deadline on Aug. 9, commenters also said proposed agency solutions are starting to be implemented.\n\nThe agency proposal, [announced in May,](https://www.enr.com/articles/56451-epa-power-plant-rule-pushes-carbon-capture-low-carbon-hydrogen) would mandate under the U.S. Clean Air Act new carbon dioxide emission cuts from those plants based on what it says are cost-effective and available control technologies\u2014specifically carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and natural gas co-firing.\u00a0\n\nNew and existing gas-powered plants operating full-time must capture 90% of emissions by 2035. Existing coal-fired power plants must do the same by 2030 to stay online in 2040\n\nEPA has said it aims to finalize the rule next year, but that could be a challenge.\n\nThe proposal would tighten emissions reduction requirements closer to those in the Obama Administration Clean Power Plan, which was only briefly enacted in 2015 because of lawsuits that challenged EPA regulatory authority. The issues were addressed last year in the U.S. Supreme Court's *West Virginia v. EPA* [ruling](https://www.enr.com/articles/54443-implications-for-industry-as-supreme-court-curbs-epas-authority).\u00a0\n\nIn a joint comment August 9, [a coalition](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-supports-epas-proposed-rule-regarding-fossil-fuel-fired)of 20 largely Democratic-led states and six cities said the proposed emissions-reduction rule is \u201cwithin the four corners of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year ... and consistent with Congress's ambitious actions to curb power plant GHG emissions.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut a group of 21 Republican-led states strongly contrasted that view[in comments](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/eenews/f/eenews/?id=00000189-d6c8-dc67-a1bf-f7fd92880002)they submitted on Aug. 8, with a legal showdown ahead likely. \u00a0\"If finalized, EPA\u2019s impossible proposal will leave coal- and natural-gas plants with no other option but to close. Yet EPA has no more authority to mandate this result indirectly than it did when it tried to do so directly.\" said the states. \"The proposed rule exceeds EPA\u2019s authority by forcing the kinds of major shifts that *West Virginia* already said can\u2019t be imposed.\"\n\nEPA estimates that between 2028 and 2042, the rule would cut 617 million metric tons of CO2 from the air in the U.S.  \n  \n\n\n### **Techs Could Limit Power Delivery**\n\nBut trade groups such as the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities and even the nonprofit, independent Electric Power Research Institute, note current shortfalls in the technologies to enable sufficient reliable power delivery. In its comments, the institute said the technologies \u00a0\u201chave seen little to no deployment at scale so far and depend on new infrastructure\u201d that affect their feasibility and costs beyond the scope of the agency analysis.\n\nThe new supporting infrastructure required\u2014including production space, pipelines and storage for hydrogen, and pipelines and storage for carbon capture\u2014\u201cshould be considered in their entirety to fully understand the potential benefits, costs and deployment challenges and opportunities,\u201d said the institute.\n\nIt said provisions in the EPA rule use optimistic assumptions about cost, schedule and operating flexibility for carbon capture and storage, adding that while hydrogen power could play an important role in a net-zero economy, it has not been demonstrated at the scale \u201cenvisioned.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it will hold a technical conference in November on the proposed rule.\n\nFour large regional power transmission operators\u2014the 13-state PJM Interconnection, 15-state Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Southwest Power Pool serving 14 states abd Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2014said the proposed rule has the potential to \u201cmaterially and adversely\u201d affect grid reliability.\u00a0\n\nSouthwest Power Pool noted its progress in being an early renewable energy integrator and large user of onshore wind to supplement fossil-fuel power when feasible, but it said proposed technologies will not be available to replace reductions in that generation.\n\nThey said that when combined with other EPA rules and policies, the CO2 emission-cut proposal \u201ccould well exacerbate\u201d the growing risk of generation retirements. New clean energy resources seeking connection \u201cdo not, at present, provide the same level of essential reliability services as their thermal counterparts,\u201d the grid operators said.\n\nWhile they support new technologies, the grid systems said EPA\u2019s proposed \u201cbest system\u201d of emissions reduction \u201coverstates\u201d current co-firing viability for carbon-capture and hydrogen \u201cand ignores the cost and practicalities of developing new supporting infrastructure\u201d within the agency's planned timeline.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHope is not an acceptable strategy,\u201d they said.\u00a0\n\nUtility members of the American Public Power Association said they have reduced GHG emissions 31% from 2005 to 2022 but noted the proposed rule's expected impact on providing affordable power reliably.\u00a0\n\nThe Iowa Utilities Board slammed EPA as \u201centirely unconcerned with the negative impacts of a lack of electricity in the bulk power system\u201d under the rule, with its hard focus on air quality impacts from coal and natural gas power plants. The agency is \u201cmeddling in reliability determinations that are outside its expertise,\" the state board said, stressing that it needs to listen to concerns by key stakeholders\n \u201cto avoid introducing further instability\u201d into the U.S. power system.\n\nA group of unions, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, ironworkers' union, Transportation Communications union, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and United Mine Workers, said the proposed rule could eliminate nearly 274,000 direct jobs in the industry and 1.1 million indirect jobs. The group supports its mandate for routine maintenance and a unit-specific emissions rate for facilities set to retire before 2032, but the unions suggested adding flexibility for states to develop in-state emission trading programs.  \n  \n\n\n### **Stakeholders Look at Solutions**\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council said the rule will reduce atmospheric CO2 and sulfur dioxide but could increase nitrogen oxide and fine particle emissions through more CCS and hydrogen. \u201cWhile the fundamental structure of the proposal is strong, key improvements can and should be made,\u201d said David Doniger, its senior strategic director.\n\nOther Edison Electric Institute members said they are installing the technologies, including Entergy in Texas, with a $1.5-billion new power plant under construction set to use a fuel blend of at least 30% hydrogen. NextEra Energy said it plans to convert over the decade most gas-powered plants of its subsidiary Florida Power & Light to run on hydrogen, while California-based Pacific Gas & Electric said it will have hydrogen fuel-blending operational by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cFar from being too restrictive, the guidelines offer flexibility and build on technology and processes that the industry is already putting in use to great effect today,\u201d said [comments](https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2023/constellation-to-file-comments-offering-support-for-new-epa-guidelines-to-reduce-carbon-emissions-from-power-plant.html) by Joe Dominguez, CEO of energy firm Constellation Energy Corp., which has been developing nuclear power. He said he was \"disappointed\" by responses \"from many of my peers represented by the Edison Electric Institute and others working to block these very practical measures.\"\n\nXcel Energy said the proposed rule is largely workable but it [recommended](file:///C%3A/Users/clarkk/Downloads/EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0072-0532_attachment_1%20(1).pdf) more compliance flexibility\u00a0\n\n\u201cCarbon capture and storage and co-firing with clean hydrogen are \napproaches individual plants can use to meet the required emission \nlimits,\u201d said Michael Myers, New York assistant attorney general, in the state comment submission, adding that states can use emissions averaging and trading to comply.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is the way cooperative federalism is supposed to work,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\nKEYWORDS: [carbon capture and storage](/keywords/2294-carbon-capture-and-storage) [Carbon reduction](/keywords/16516-carbon-reduction) [Clean energy construction](/keywords/18635-clean-energy-construction) [EPA](/keywords/193-epa) [federal regulation](/keywords/6086-federal-regulation) [Hydrogen Power](/keywords/17033-hydrogen-power) [power plant](/keywords/118-power-plant) [Proposal](/keywords/91-proposal) [US Environmental Protection Agency](/keywords/6540-us-environmental-protection-agency)\n\n\n### Share This Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n[![ENR Subscribe](/ext/resources/custom-content/Registration/ENR-subscribe.png)](/unlimited)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![Mbpowersheadshot](https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/images/2018/MBPowersheadshot.jpeg?height=96&t=1546273310&width=96)](https://www.enr.com/authors/151-mary-b-powers)**Mary B.

[Chris Bowen told an Australian Business Economists forum in Sydney that policies were needed to ensure a level playing field for Australian firms](https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/bowen-s-green-tariff-to-shield-steel-cement-against-carbon-leakage-20230814-p5dwew). Mentioning the European Union\u2019s (EU) CBAM by name, he said that his department would prepare a review to assess carbon leakage risks, develop policy options and look at the feasibility of an Australian CBAM, particularly in relation to steel and cement.\n\n\nThe Antipodean nation has past form when it comes to carbon legislation. Back in 2012 it introduced the Clean Energy Act under the Gillard administration. The legislation was intended to introduce an emissions trading scheme with a carbon pricing scheme. However, it faced opposition from rival political parties and the Cement Industry Federation warned that the local cement sector was vulnerable to overseas competitors outside of the scheme. Job losses followed and Adelaide Brighton appeared to react by focusing more on imports. The Abbott administration then abolished the act in 2014 putting forward its Clean Energy Future package instead, which focused more on investing towards change. Jump forward nearly a decade and the Albanese government passed its Climate Change Bill in 2022. This set legally binding targets, including a commitment to cut CO2 emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2030. Bowen\u2019s look at a CBAM is an obvious next step from here, addressing one of the main criticisms of the previous Clean Energy Act.\n\n\nLocal building materials company Boral reacted positively to a CBAM in its annual results released earlier this week with chief executive officer Vik Bansal saying that the company was \u201c...advocating for an effective Carbon Border Adjusted Mechanism for Australia.\u201d He also reconfirmed the group\u2019s commitment to a target of net zero emissions by 2050. However, at the same time, Boral also reduced its emissions reduction target to 2025 from 2019 figures to up to 14% from 19% previously. This was blamed on \u201cexternal factors\u201d such as delays in securing the required regulatory approvals for the next phases of an alternative fuel program. Mining company Rio Tinto also warned in late July 2023, as part of its half-year financial results, that it might potentially miss its emissions target for 2025 unless it resorted to buying carbon credits.\n\n\nCBAMs became serious in 2023 when the EU passed its own scheme into law in May 2023. The EU CBAM will now enter into a transitional phase from 1 October 2023 until the end of 2025. During this period importers of goods covered by the legislation will be required to report greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) embedded in their imports (direct and indirect emissions) but they will not have to make any financial payments or adjustments. The system will then enter its full format from 1 January 2026, with affected importers being forced to purchase and surrender CBAM certificates, which will be priced at the EU emission trading scheme (ETS) rate, currently at around Euro88/t. [Other CBAMs have also been mooted in Canada and the US](/3.\thttps://www.globalcement.com/news/item/14316-too-taxing-how-the-cbam-affects-cement-exporters-to-the-eu). [In Canada the government ran a consultation on border carbon adjustments in 2021](/2.\thttps://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/consultations/2021/border-carbon-adjustments.html). It is currently considering its next steps. The US meanwhile has had both Republican and Democrat party senators make separate suggestions for a CBAM since at least 2021.\n\n\nJust because the EU is set to implement its CBAM and other countries are considering their own versions doesn\u2019t mean that they are necessarily a good idea. Cembureau, the European cement association, has been steadily lobbying on the details such as indirect emissions and waste incineration in the EU CBAM for years. Criticisms of CBAMs in general include potential clashes with World Trade Organisation rules, accusations of protectionism, triggering inflation, not being equitable to less developed nations and even failing to stop carbon leakage in the first place. The EU CBAM has also linked itself to the local ETS price. So, even after the transitional period, the carbon price may start to jump about in unpredictable ways once the system fully goes live in 2026.\n\n\nThe game-changer in recent years for international carbon emissions reduction legislation though was arguably when the US government introduced its Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This is because it served both sustainability and self-interest on a grander scale than seen previously. The act promised US$369bn in subsidies for companies to invest in low carbon technology. However, the catch was that the investment tied supply chains to the US market, much to the ire of some of the US\u2019 trade partners such as the EU. CBAMs offer a similar opportunity to governments around the world if they choose. They can be used to protect domestic carbon emission reduction effects in heavy industry but they can also be used for protectionism. Hence Bowen was due to say during his speech that the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies elsewhere \u201cmean that Australia needs to act to stay in the game.\u201d Australia has the advantage that it can watch how the EU CBAM pans out before it implements its own version.\n\n ", "summaries": [{"summary": "Australia's Climate Change Minister, Chris Bowen, plans to explore the possibility of implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to ensure a level playing field for Australian companies.

Add to this a growing pressure to decarbonise and this remit is now more challenging than ever before.\n\n\nThe climate emergency is shifting the commercial landscape in all directions and the consequences of inaction will only increase, even to the point where a vessel can no longer legally operate. As captains and advisors, it\u2019s our responsibility to act in the best interests of the owner and to provide the best possible advice on every aspect of superyacht ownership, and this includes risk management across the board. The very real prospect of stranded assets cannot be overstated; it poses an existential threat to the entire industry and our survival will be determined by what we do, or fail to do, today.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**What is a stranded asset?**  \nA stranded asset is defined as \u201can asset which loses economic value well ahead of its anticipated useful life\u201d (Daniela Saltzman, *Stranded Carbon Assets*). This unanticipated devaluation can be caused by a range of risk factors, including changes in legislation, market forces, environmental challenges, social norms and consumer behaviour.\n\n\n**Decarbonisation**  \nThe IPCC 6th assessment 2023 report on climate change summarises the current trajectory as follows: \u201c*Limiting human-caused global warming requires net zero CO2 emissions. Cumulative carbon emissions until the time of reaching net-zero CO2 emissions and the level of greenhouse gas emission reductions this decade largely determine whether warming can be limited to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C (high confidence). Projected CO2\u00a0 emissions from existing fossil-fuel infrastructure without additional abatement would exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5\u00b0C (50 per cent).*\u201d\n\n\nThese facts are well known, yet the superyacht industry continues to fly in the face of growing scrutiny from regulators, legislators, the marketplace and society at large.\n\n\n**Social uprising**  \nWe are seeing an increase in laws, public protests and negative stories in the media against the level of emissions, as well as criticism of the overall footprint of the UHNWI lifestyle.\n\n\nAvoiding scrutiny is not a matter of privilege. Whichever way you look at it, whether moral, financial or existential, the time to implement a credible and practical strategy towards decarbonisation is now. Whether or not an individual owner is motivated by environmental concerns, owners\u2019 reps and their inner circle have an urgent obligation to impress upon their clients the very real threat of reputational damage and financial losses.\n\n\n![](https://media.superyachtnews.com/uploads/2023-226/a498727341b6369436cf89e056da0614.jpg)**Nigel Marrison, founder, [Blue ESG](https://www.superyachtnews.com/directory/profile/906249/blue-esg)**\n\n\n**Regulatory pressures**  \nFrom a regulatory perspective, it\u2019s only a matter of time before MARPOL Annex VI CII and SEEMP Part III regulations from the merchant fleet filter down to include luxury yachts.\n\n\nThe EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by setting limits. EU ETS is currently applicable for ships above 5,000gt on EU-related voyages, although in future may include other ship types and sizes with the potential to impact the operation of superyachts.\n\n\n**Legislative changes**  \nThe United Nations Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) is an industry-led, UN-convened group that aims to accelerate the implementation of decarbonisation strategies. It brings together 125 banks in 41 countries, representing more than 40 per cent of global banking assets, committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n\nThe insurance industry is implementing similar measures as defined in the Poseidon Principles which requires alignment with Net Zero 2050 targets across their portfolios.\n\n\nFrom a financial perspective alone, superyacht owners will be forced to accept that they are not immune. A refusal to align with global-emissions goals will increasingly pose a challenge to the operation of their yacht.\n\n\nClimate change, regulation and societal acceptance are deeply interconnected, and how we tackle these issues today will determine the very future of luxury yachting. Compared to every other sector, the superyacht industry is lagging conspicuously behind.\n\n\n**Project \u2018Yacht Zero\u2019**  \nIn collaboration with the decarbonisation team at [Lloyd\u2019s Register](https://www.superyachtnews.com/directory/profile/798811/lloyds-register-emea), Blue ESG has designed and developed a superyacht-specific Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) analogous to IMO MARPOL Annex VI CII and SEEMP Part III for the merchant fleet.\n\n\nProject \u2018Yacht Zero\u2019 is a data-collection, analytic tool allowing individual vessels to establish baseline data and facilitate tracking and reporting for operational emissions.\n\n**Profile links**\n\n[Lloyd's Register EMEA](/syindex/profile/798811/lloyds-register-emea)\n\n[Blue ESG](/syindex/profile/906249/blue-esg)\n\n \n\n\nJoin the discussion\n===================\n\nDon\u2019t be left high and dry\n--------------------------\n\n \n\n35018\n\n\n\n\nTo post comments please Sign in or Register\n\n\n\nWhen commenting please [follow our house rules](/discussions-house-rules)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n*[Click here](/shop) to become part of The Superyacht Group community, and join us in our mission to make this industry accessible to all, and prosperous for the long-term.

Tevva targeted this market given its size, rapid growth rate and its impact on the environment. Commercial vehicles, which stop frequently and largely operate in urban areas, are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.  \nTransportation is one of the largest contributors to CO2\u00a0emissions globally, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles account for 22% of the transportation industry\u2019s emissions. While many fleet operators recognize the benefits zero-emission vehicles deliver, they also need reliable and cost-effective solutions. \n\nTevva\u2019s products have demonstrated their reliability and ability to provide customers with a compelling return on investment. Tevva has built a commercial vehicle ecosystem alongside its technical partners, including strategic investor Bharat Forge, with which it has worked with since 2018, to tailor its products to the needs of its customers accordingly. \n**Proposed Transaction Details**\n\nThe proposed transaction with ElectraMeccanica and Tevva is the culmination of a formal process initiated by ElectraMeccanica\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cElectraMeccanica Board\u201d) to explore a range of possible strategic alternatives for optimizing ElectraMeccanica\u2019s assets and generating sustained shareholder value while still managing potential risks.  \nFollowing the completion of a comprehensive process in which Tevva and others were thoroughly evaluated, the Strategic Committee of the Board of Directors of ElectraMeccanica, comprising Steven Sanders (Chairman), Mike Richardson (Vice Chairman) and Dietmar Ostermann (Director), made a unanimous, formal recommendation to ElectraMeccanica\u2019s Board of Directors to pursue a combination with Tevva and proceed with the proposed transaction.\n\n\nUpon the closing of the proposed transaction, ElectraMeccanica shareholders will own 23.5% of the combined company and Tevva shareholders will own 76.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. The combined company expects to have a cash balance of approximately $70 \u2013 80 million, with debt of approximately $26 million.\n\n\nAt closing of the proposed transaction, the combined company will operate as Tevva, Inc., and is expected to be domiciled in Delaware. It is anticipated that the combined company and its shares will trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol TVVA, subject to the receipt of all applicable Nasdaq approvals.\n\n\nThe combined company is expected to benefit from the acceleration of Tevva\u2019s U.S. market entry, supported by the complementary platform, team, and assets of ElectraMeccanica, in addition to anticipated long-term reductions in material costs. The transaction is also expected to deliver approximately $5 million in run-rate annual cost savings by year-end 2024.\n\n\nThe Board of Directors of the combined company will consist of nine directors, comprising five directors from Tevva and four directors from ElectraMeccanica, of which seven are expected to be deemed independent.\n\n\nThe senior executive team of the combined company will reflect the significant talent and experience at the leadership level of both companies. Following the completion of the proposed transaction, it is expected that Susan E. Docherty will become Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. Ms. Docherty joined ElectraMeccanica in December 2022 as CEO and has over 40 years of senior leadership experience, including 30 years of international automotive experience at General Motors where she held a number of senior roles including President and Managing Director of Chevrolet/Cadillac Europe, Vice President of International Operations, Sales, Marketing and Aftersales in China, and Vice President of U.S. Sales, Service and Marketing. Ms. Docherty also serves as a Board Director of The Brink\u2019s Company. It is also expected that David Roberts, who has served as a Board Director for Tevva for three years, will become Executive Chairman of the combined company. Mr. Roberts is a recognized expert in the industrial, transportation and clean energy sectors and in addition to his role at Tevva, Mr. Roberts chairs the Board of Directors of TAE Technologies (a commercial fusion energy developer) and Evtec Group (an automotive supply chain company). Previously, he held executive positions with Chrysler and Aston Martin Lagonda. During his time at Tevva, Mr. Roberts has overseen Tevva\u2019s rapid growth through commercialization and managed key supplier, partner, and customer relationships globally.\n\n\nThe proposed transaction will be completed, subject to the definitive arrangement agreement, by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), whereby a newly formed British Columbia corporation (\u201cTevva, Inc.\u201d), created to manage and hold the combined business of ElectraMeccanica and Tevva, will, directly and indirectly, acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of ElectraMeccanica and Tevva.\n\n\nIn addition, concurrent with the announcement of the proposed merger, the Board of ElectraMeccanica has approved, under certain conditions, the provision of a $6 million credit facility to Tevva which can be drawn in whole or in part until the closing of the proposed transaction. If drawn, the credit facility is intended to provide Tevva with additional working capital to accelerate delivery of commercial vehicles to fleet customers.\n\n\nThe proposed transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, following the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions, including, among others, required approvals of ElectraMeccanica\u2019s and Tevva\u2019s shareholders of the proposed transaction, the approval of the Supreme Court of British Columbia of the proposed transaction, and the conditional approval for the shares of the Resulting Issuer to be listed on of Nasdaq.\n\n\nAll Officers and Directors of ElectraMeccanica support the transaction and have entered into support and voting agreements (subject to certain rights of withdrawal) for all of their shares, including ElectraMeccanica\u2019s founder and largest shareholder. This cumulatively represents 9.67 million shares, or approximately 7.89% of ElectraMeccanica\u2019s outstanding shares. In addition, the aforementioned ElectraMeccanica shareholders and key shareholders of Tevva (representing 49% of Tevva\u2019s current shares outstanding), have entered into lock-up agreements in connection with the proposed transaction, which will subject them to a 180-day restricted period, subject to certain release exemptions based on the trading level of the combined company\u2019s stock price.\n\n\nIn connection with the proposed transaction, ElectraMeccanica anticipates filing a proxy statement and management information circular (the \u201cCircular\u201d) in connection with a special meeting of holders of ElectraMeccanica common shares expected to be held in the third quarter of this year to approve the proposed transaction.\n\n\nAbout Tevva\n\n\nTevva is disrupting zero-emission commercial transport with revolutionary battery electric and hydrogen fuel-cell range extender technology.
